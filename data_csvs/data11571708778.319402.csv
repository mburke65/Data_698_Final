0,Reid J. Epstein and Lisa Lerer,"DES MOINES Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the new Iowa polling leader, narrowly in first place ahead of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a new poll of the state from The Des Moines Register and CNN.

Biden Jr. broke away from the rest of the Democratic pack.,2019-09-22,The New York Times,Warren Leads in New Iowa Poll With Biden Second,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/us/politics/Iowa-biden-warren-.html,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., placed fourth in The Register’s poll, with 9 percent. He had 14 percent in The Register’s June poll and has fallen in other surveys of the state since then before launching a television advertising campaign here after Labor Day.

The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign.

Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers.

In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field — 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her, the poll found. Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate.

The dynamics are far from set: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, and 63 percent said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate."

Picket Line in Detroit as Democrats Use Strike to Court Labor,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-uaw-strike.html,"Addressing the striking U.A.W. workers in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Biden wore a red T-shirt in solidarity. He referenced the bailout of General Motors during the Obama administration, telling the crowd, “We didn’t bail out GM, U.A.W. bailed out GM!” He went on to lament the high pay of executives at the company and the lack of equitable benefits for workers, and he encouraged the striking workers, acknowledging, “you’re making a hell of a sacrifice.”

“There’s only one reason we have a middle class, and it’s spelled ‘U-N-I-O-N,’” he said. The crowd cheered.

Auto-worker support for the Democratic Party has eroded slightly in recent years, and about 30 percent of the union’s rank and file were estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, slightly more than the share who voted for the two previous Republican presidential nominees.

The departure of those voters from the Democratic Party, even as the union had officially endorsed Hillary Clinton, was particularly critical to Mr. Trump in Michigan, where he won by the thinnest of margins — less than 11,000 votes — to capture the state’s 16 electoral votes.

Nearly three years later, it is unclear how many of those union workers continue to back the president. The economy has generally remained strong here, with unemployment near a 20-year low.

Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a district just outside of Detroit that is home to several auto manufacturing facilities, said she felt that Mr. Trump’s support among autoworkers had held roughly steady.

But she said she believed that a prolonged strike could move the president’s numbers among such workers in one direction or the other, depending on whether they viewed him as trying to help or hurt them."

His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O’Rourke during his Senate race last year — including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O’Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire?

“Oh, I’m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,” Mr. O’Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being “deflated?”).

Mr. O’Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body. He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity because, he explained, being polite and restrained “doesn’t always express the anger o r the urgency that I feel.”

His zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall — the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase — ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. “We did not see that coming,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase.

Late on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O’Rourke’s El Paso home to commiserate. “They were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto’s house,” Mr. O’Rourke recalled. “They just walked in and were like ‘Hey dude, we’re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?’”

“And I was like, ‘Sure, but you can’t just walk into someone’s house like this.’ And they were like ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’”

Mr. O’Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president. From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition. He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year’s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away."

Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent.

“This is the first major shake-up” of the race, The Register’s pollster, Ann Selzer, told the paper.

The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else.

Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual.

“You could be No. 6,” Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. “I’m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, ‘Not bad.’ They’re going to look at who is in the top eight.”

Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa.

“I don’t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,” he said. “I’d be shocked if it’s more than five.”"

Is It Time to Level the Playing Field?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/us/school-football-poverty.html,"“We don’t feel like we are coddling these students; we feel like we are trying to put them on an even playing field,” said Peter Weber, executive director of the Oregon School Activities Association, which oversees high school athletics. “We need to match kids up with competition that is safe for them so they can walk out on a field and be competitive.”

But others, including many coaches, say the change adds new barriers for impoverished students, and suggests they are too weak or too poor to compete against richer rivals. Why, they ask, should students’ athletic potential be limited by their parents’ bank accounts? And some opponents say tinkering with longstanding athletic matchups in an attempt to even the odds is a way of babying young people — a “medals for everyone” mentality that undermines lessons in resilience and grit.

“They’re out there making do with what they have, and that’s the right thing to do,” said Gabe Murray, 19, a former Hoover football player.

Tom Farrey, executive director of the Aspen Institute’s Sports & Society Program, said the sports achievement disparity between wealthy suburban public schools and their urban counterparts has degenerated into “a competitive gap that is similar to the income gap” in the nation.

“The divide has always been there,” he said, “but it has widened.”

The disparity, experts say, is meaningful beyond the world of athletics because sports participation has been found to aid in academic success and college admissions, and is a predictor for professional success.

The discussion comes at a critical juncture for youth sports, where participation rates for many activities — particularly football — are in decline because of fears about brain injury and because children’s interests more than ever fall outside engagement in traditional sports, according to studies."
5,David A.

Even last November’s “blue wave” hardly threatened Republican incumbents like Warren Davidson of suburban Cincinnati-Dayton, who won re-election by 33 percentage points; Gary Palmer of suburban Birmingham, Ala., who won by 38 points; or Francis Rooney of suburban Cape Coral, Fla., who won by 25 points.

Uneven patterns of racial diversification explain much of this growing partisan gap. In the top 20 metro areas, more than a third of adult suburban residents are now nonwhite, compared with less than one-quarter of the suburban population in smaller metros. The number of large-metro suburban House seats where members of racial minorities outnumber whites increased to 36 in today’s Congress from nine in 1993 and is poised to grow further after the national round of redistricting following the 2020 census. White voters in large metros are also politically distinctive, holding relatively liberal cultural views that make them more likely than whites elsewhere to support Democratic candidates.

While pundits once advised Democratic leaders that courting suburban support would require breaking with liberal orthodoxy, the party’s new electoral coalition of minorities and culturally progressive whites has allowed it to unite around left-of-center positions on issues from gun control to gay rights.

Still, internal tensions remain. House Democrats elected from majority-white suburban districts are nearly twice as likely to join the centrist New Democrat Coalition or Blue Dog Coalition as they are the Congressional Progressive Caucus. And some express concern that the recent publicity received by left-wing policy proposals like the Green New Deal will threaten the party’s popularity among their more economically moderate constituents.

The increasing Democratic strength within populous, racially diverse metropolitan areas like Atlanta, Houston and Phoenix will leave its mark on the electoral map as soon as the 2020 election, transforming Georgia, Texas and Arizona from Republican bastions to contested battlegrounds. A few other metro areas that are slightly smaller in size but comparable in demographic composition, like Las Vegas; Richmond, Va.; and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., are also likely to become increasingly critical sources of Democratic votes in national elections.

But President Trump’s historically strong performance in a string of smaller and more homogeneous suburbs from greater Scranton, Pa., to greater Des Moines proved pivotal in the 2016 election and could well recur in 2020. Broadening the Democratic tent to bring more of these socially traditionalist small-metro suburbanites into the fold would provide the party with a critical electoral advantage, but such gains will be difficult to achieve in an era of growing cultural warfare.

Rather than moving in a single partisan direction, American suburbia — like the nation of which it is a growing part — has split into incompatible halves of brightening red and deepening blue, frustrating both parties’ attempts to build a stable national majority on a foundation of suburban votes."

With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.

Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for “Medicare for all.”

“Let me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “What we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.”"

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

Here's How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/24/business/economy/wealth-tax-rich.html,"Among Democratic presidential candidates, it’s the rallying cry of the moment — tax the rich. The idea is a centerpiece of the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. A former candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, went so far as to say the government ought to “tax the hell out of the wealthy.”

The new taxes would fund a laundry list of liberal proposals — “Medicare for all,” free college, combating global warming and rebuilding roads and bridges.

But these measures will face fierce opposition, including from wealthy donors. Republicans in Congress are sure to oppose new taxes, making passage impossible unless Democrats take both houses of Congress in 2020. Whatever their political fate, these proposals represent the broadest rethinking of tax policy in decades.

“We seem to go back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on taxing the rich, depending on who is in power,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. “But the Democrats now are a good deal more aggressive than they’ve been in the past.”

Four ideas have gained the most traction: a tax on wealth, raising marginal tax rates, expanding the estate tax and changing how the government taxes capital gains.

Creating a Wealth Tax

How many people would pay? Relatively few. Would it reduce inequality? Almost certainly. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Probably.

In January, Ms. Warren took a bold new approach by proposing to tax wealth, not just income. Her proposal would impose a 2 percent tax on assets above $50 million, or the top 70,000 families by wealth, in a nation of nearly 330 million people. Someone with $100 million in assets would pay $1 million a year. Fortunes over $1 billion would be subject to an additional 1 percent surcharge.

The tax, akin to how property taxes work, would be aimed at a group that controls a growing portion of the nation’s wealth. The 400 richest Americans own 3.5 percent of the country’s assets, according to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who have advised Ms. Warren. Over time, her tax would reduce that to 2 percent, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. If it had been in place since 1982, the fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, would now be $87 billion, rather than $160 billion, they estimate, using figures from before his divorce.

Ms. Warren’s proposal would bring in $2.6 trillion over 10 years, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. At $260 billion a year, that is a small share of total annual federal spending of $4.4 trillion. Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, have disputed earlier estimates by the two economists as overly optimistic.

On Tuesday Mr. Sanders is proposing his own wealth tax, one that goes after mega-wealth even more aggressively than Ms. Warren’s proposal. His graduated tax would start at 1 percent for assets of more than $32 million, climbing to 8 percent for wealth exceeding $10 billion. The tax would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over a decade.

As appealing as a wealth tax might sound for the party’s liberal base, enacting it would pose major challenges. Anyone lucky enough to be in its sights has access to top tax lawyers and accountants who can sift through the tax code for a way out, or at least a means of minimizing the hit.

European countries have had mixed success with wealth taxes. Weak enforcement and offshore havens have enabled many individuals to greatly reduce what they owe. The Internal Revenue Service would need detailed reports from banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions to make the tax effective.

“It could raise a lot of money but probably less than Elizabeth Warren thinks,” Mr. Toder said.

Raising top income tax rates

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? Probably. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Yes.

Raising the top income tax rate is one of the most straightforward ways to tax the rich and some prominent Democrats have embraced it. For example, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City has said that the government should impose a 70 percent tax on earnings above $10 million.

While that might sound radical, it would actually represent a return to tax policies that prevailed for decades. The top income tax rate stood at 70 percent as recently as 1980, and was even higher before then, topping 90 percent in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In terms of inequality, it would effectively reduce some of the extremes in pay that have developed in recent decades. The vast fortunes accumulated by a few dozen billionaires have also made new taxes more politically palatable. For example, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent tax would be paid by about 21,000 taxpayers.

Over 10 years, her proposal would raise up to $382 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That is about half as much as the government will spend on the Defense Department this fiscal year.

With the help of accountants and lawyers, the wealthy would no doubt try to find ways to convert earned income into capital gains or business income, which are currently taxed at lower rates.

Raising the estate tax

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? A lot. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Most likely.

Experts say inherited wealth is an important driver of inequality. The estate tax is meant to combat that, but in recent decades lawmakers have made it easier for taxpayers to avoid it. Mr. Sanders wants to change that.

Under his proposal, the estate tax rate would begin at 45 percent for assets worth more than $3.5 million and rise to 77 percent for those with more than $1 billion. The proposal would apply to just 0.2 percent of the population, according to Mr. Sanders.

The senator’s plan would raise $315 billion over 10 years, or less than half of military spending this year. But the higher tax on estates worth more than $1 billion could raise $2.2 trillion over the long term. Mr. Sanders has said he wants the money to pay for his ambitious agenda of social programs.

Ms. Warren has also proposed expanding the estate tax as part of a housing bill. The estate tax would start at 55 percent and rise to 75 percent. She has said that the tax would affect 14,000 wealthy families a year.

Lawyers and accountants have devised many strategies for avoiding the estate tax, said Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the Tax Foundation. Of course, if Congress were to adopt Mr. Sanders’s proposal, lawmakers could also try to close some of those loopholes.

Raising capital gains tax rates

How many people would pay? Relatively few taxpayers. Would it reduce inequality? Most likely. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Possibly.

Several Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, want to end the discrepancy between how different kinds of income are taxed. To wit, long-term capital gains are taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, but the top rate for salary and wage income is 37 percent.

Lower taxes on investment income skew the system in favor of wealthier households and raising capital gains tax rates would change that.

As of 2016, about 80 percent of the income of households that earn less than $198,000 a year comes in the form of wages and salaries, according to a paper by Lily Batchelder and David Kamin of the New York University School of Law. By contrast, capital gains and dividends account for 70 percent of the income of the families that earn $53 million or more a year.

“The way that the very top of earners in our country make money is very different from the rest,” Mr. Kamin said.

Sources of income by income group 2016 BOTTOM 95 PERCENT Wages/salaries 80% Business income 4% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 3% Other 13% TOP .001 PERCENT Wages/salaries 10% Business income 13% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 71% Other 6% 2016 BOTTOM 95 PERCENT Wages/salaries 80% Business income 4% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 3% Other 13% TOP .001 PERCENT Wages/salaries 10% Business income 13% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 71% Other 6% 2016 BOTTOM 95 PERCENT Wages/salaries 80% Business income 4% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 3% Other 13% TOP .001 PERCENT Wages/salaries 10% Business income 13% Long term capital gains and qualified dividends 71% Other 6% Source: Lily Batchelder and David Kamin, New York University School of Law

The top 10 percent of households by income own 84 percent of all stocks. Mr. Biden’s plan is aimed at this group and would raise the capital gains rate to 39.6 percent for top earners.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who is not running for president, would go further still by fundamentally changing how capital gains are taxed, at least for the wealthiest Americans. He recently proposed taxing the appreciation of stocks held by the richest 0.3 percent of households, even if those gains haven’t been realized. Mr. Wyden also favors equalizing the rate at which earned income and capital gains are taxed.

The senator’s proposal would have the effect of trimming the wings of billionaires who have watched their fortunes soar but haven’t sold their shares.

The proposal from Mr. Wyden would raise an estimated $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years, which would be earmarked for Social Security. Mr. Biden would allocate money raised in part from hiking capital gains taxes to pay the $750 billion cost of expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Simply raising capital gains taxes without other reforms is tricky as taxpayers could choose not to sell stocks to avoid owing money. Based on research it has analyzed, the Tax Policy Center estimates that raising the capital gains rate above 30 percent would reduce revenues, Mr. Toder said. Taxing appreciation as Mr. Wyden has proposed would help address this."

With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.

Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for “Medicare for all.”

“Let me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “What we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.”"

Here's How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/24/business/economy/wealth-tax-rich.html,"Among Democratic presidential candidates, it’s the rallying cry of the moment — tax the rich. The idea is a centerpiece of the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. A former candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, went so far as to say the government ought to “tax the hell out of the wealthy.”

The new taxes would fund a laundry list of liberal proposals — “Medicare for all,” free college, combating global warming and rebuilding roads and bridges.

But these measures will face fierce opposition, including from wealthy donors. Republicans in Congress are sure to oppose new taxes, making passage impossible unless Democrats take both houses of Congress in 2020. Whatever their political fate, these proposals represent the broadest rethinking of tax policy in decades.

“We seem to go back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on taxing the rich, depending on who is in power,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. “But the Democrats now are a good deal more aggressive than they’ve been in the past.”

Four ideas have gained the most traction: a tax on wealth, raising marginal tax rates, expanding the estate tax and changing how the government taxes capital gains.

Creating a Wealth Tax

How many people would pay? Relatively few. Would it reduce inequality? Almost certainly. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Probably.

In January, Ms. Warren took a bold new approach by proposing to tax wealth, not just income. Her proposal would impose a 2 percent tax on assets above $50 million, or the top 70,000 families by wealth, in a nation of nearly 330 million people. Someone with $100 million in assets would pay $1 million a year. Fortunes over $1 billion would be subject to an additional 1 percent surcharge.

The tax, akin to how property taxes work, would be aimed at a group that controls a growing portion of the nation’s wealth. The 400 richest Americans own 3.5 percent of the country’s assets, according to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who have advised Ms. Warren. Over time, her tax would reduce that to 2 percent, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. If it had been in place since 1982, the fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, would now be $87 billion, rather than $160 billion, they estimate, using figures from before his divorce.

Ms. Warren’s proposal would bring in $2.6 trillion over 10 years, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. At $260 billion a year, that is a small share of total annual federal spending of $4.4 trillion. Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, have disputed earlier estimates by the two economists as overly optimistic.

On Tuesday Mr. Sanders is proposing his own wealth tax, one that goes after mega-wealth even more aggressively than Ms. Warren’s proposal. His graduated tax would start at 1 percent for assets of more than $32 million, climbing to 8 percent for wealth exceeding $10 billion. The tax would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over a decade.

As appealing as a wealth tax might sound for the party’s liberal base, enacting it would pose major challenges. Anyone lucky enough to be in its sights has access to top tax lawyers and accountants who can sift through the tax code for a way out, or at least a means of minimizing the hit.

European countries have had mixed success with wealth taxes. Weak enforcement and offshore havens have enabled many individuals to greatly reduce what they owe. The Internal Revenue Service would need detailed reports from banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions to make the tax effective.

“It could raise a lot of money but probably less than Elizabeth Warren thinks,” Mr. Toder said.

Raising top income tax rates

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? Probably. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Yes.

Raising the top income tax rate is one of the most straightforward ways to tax the rich and some prominent Democrats have embraced it. For example, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City has said that the government should impose a 70 percent tax on earnings above $10 million.

While that might sound radical, it would actually represent a return to tax policies that prevailed for decades. The top income tax rate stood at 70 percent as recently as 1980, and was even higher before then, topping 90 percent in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In terms of inequality, it would effectively reduce some of the extremes in pay that have developed in recent decades. The vast fortunes accumulated by a few dozen billionaires have also made new taxes more politically palatable. For example, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent tax would be paid by about 21,000 taxpayers.

Over 10 years, her proposal would raise up to $382 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That is about half as much as the government will spend on the Defense Department this fiscal year.

With the help of accountants and lawyers, the wealthy would no doubt try to find ways to convert earned income into capital gains or business income, which are currently taxed at lower rates.

Raising the estate tax

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? A lot. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Most likely.

Experts say inherited wealth is an important driver of inequality. The estate tax is meant to combat that, but in recent decades lawmakers have made it easier for taxpayers to avoid it. Mr. Sanders wants to change that.

Under his proposal, the estate tax rate would begin at 45 percent for assets worth more than $3.5 million and rise to 77 percent for those with more than $1 billion. The proposal would apply to just 0.2 percent of the population, according to Mr. Sanders.

The senator’s plan would raise $315 billion over 10 years, or less than half of military spending this year. But the higher tax on estates worth more than $1 billion could raise $2.2 trillion over the long term. Mr. Sanders has said he wants the money to pay for his ambitious agenda of social programs.

Ms. Warren has also proposed expanding the estate tax as part of a housing bill. The estate tax would start at 55 percent and rise to 75 percent. She has said that the tax would affect 14,000 wealthy families a year.

Lawyers and accountants have devised many strategies for avoiding the estate tax, said Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the Tax Foundation. Of course, if Congress were to adopt Mr. Sanders’s proposal, lawmakers could also try to close some of those loopholes.

Raising capital gains tax rates

How many people would pay? Relatively few taxpayers. Would it reduce inequality? Most likely. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Possibly.

Several Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, want to end the discrepancy between how different kinds of income are taxed. To wit, long-term capital gains are taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, but the top rate for salary and wage income is 37 percent.

Lower taxes on investment income skew the system in favor of wealthier households and raising capital gains tax rates would change that.

As of 2016, about 80 percent of the income of households that earn less than $198,000 a year comes in the form of wages and salaries, according to a paper by Lily Batchelder and David Kamin of the New York University School of Law. By contrast, capital gains and dividends account for 70 percent of the income of the families that earn $53 million or more a year.

“The way that the very top of earners in our country make money is very different from the rest,” Mr. Kamin said.

The top 10 percent of households by income own 84 percent of all stocks. Mr. Biden’s plan is aimed at this group and would raise the capital gains rate to 39.6 percent for top earners.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who is not running for president, would go further still by fundamentally changing how capital gains are taxed, at least for the wealthiest Americans. He recently proposed taxing the appreciation of stocks held by the richest 0.3 percent of households, even if those gains haven’t been realized. Mr. Wyden also favors equalizing the rate at which earned income and capital gains are taxed.

The senator’s proposal would have the effect of trimming the wings of billionaires who have watched their fortunes soar but haven’t sold their shares.

The proposal from Mr. Wyden would raise an estimated $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years, which would be earmarked for Social Security. Mr. Biden would allocate money raised in part from hiking capital gains taxes to pay the $750 billion cost of expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Simply raising capital gains taxes without other reforms is tricky as taxpayers could choose not to sell stocks to avoid owing money. Based on research it has analyzed, the Tax Policy Center estimates that raising the capital gains rate above 30 percent would reduce revenues, Mr. Toder said. Taxing appreciation as Mr. Wyden has proposed would help address this."

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump’s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden’s mind."

But behind the scenes, many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have been grappling with a new reality: For the first time, a presidential primary will unfold with a sitting president seeking re-election while also facing an impeachment inquiry.

There is no political playbook for this. No pollster or strategist to speak from experience. What is clear, from interviews with advisers and allies with the various campaigns, is that the top candidates like Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren believe they are sufficiently established in the race that they can continue to command attention for their candidacies and messages. Second-tier and third-tier candidates, however, are at much greater risk of falling off the radar screen for an electorate that may soon be at a standstill, distracted by an impeachment circus in Washington.

Capitalism needs a wealth tax

The idea of a wealth tax is not new, but it gained mainstream popularity with the publication in 2013 of the French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the book that launched a thousand think pieces. Mr. Piketty, who has expressed support for both Ms. Warren’s and Mr. Sanders’s campaigns, argued that a capitalist economy inevitably produces wealth inequality that is self-perpetuating and, if left unchecked, “potentially terrifying.” He wrote:

When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.

To avert what he calls “patrimonial capitalism,” where rich people get ever richer only by virtue of being rich in the first place, Mr. Piketty prescribed a global wealth tax, progressing from 1 percent on assets of one million euros to 5 to 10 percent on assets above a billion euros (as well as an “optimal” top marginal income tax in developed countries around 80 percent).

“Short of that, many may turn against globalization,” he wrote with prescience in The Financial Times in 2014. “If, one day, they found a common voice, it would speak the disremembered mantras of nationalism and economic isolation.”

A wealth tax may not work

Even those sympathetic to the spirit of a wealth tax acknowledge that there are considerable pragmatic obstacles to its implementation. Even if there were sufficient political will to pass it, it could face a constitutional challenge. Megan McArdle , a libertarian Washington Post columnist, writes:

The big problem is Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids “direct taxes” on people or property unless they’re “apportioned” — doled out among the states by population. Instituting an income tax required a constitutional amendment to override that clause, and Warren’s plan might well require another.

Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have cited numerous legal experts who say a wealth tax would be constitutional. But with the Supreme Court’s composition being what it is, the question is far from settled.

There’s also the matter of enforcement. As Paul Krugman notes, the wealthy are quite good at avoiding taxes and evading them illegally. And because many assets owned by the ultra-wealthy — like artwork and diamonds — aren’t always traded on the market, Ms. McArdle writes, taxing them would mean “creating a lot of administrative capacity to track and price the assets, with the wealthy and their lawyers fighting every step of the way.”

“If these difficulties prove insurmountable,” writes Noah Smith, a left-leaning economist, in Bloomberg, “Warren and other egalitarian tax crusaders might consider an alternative — an inheritance tax, which would close many of the loopholes that now riddle the U.S. estate tax.” He adds:

Taxing all income from inheritances — including trusts, foundations, gifts, estates, and any other kind of family transfers — at a very high rate would yield a result similar to a small annual wealth tax, only its constitutionality would be less in doubt. And it would focus the tax on the rich people whose fortunes Americans are most likely to think of as being undeserved.

A wealth tax is a bad idea

Skeptics of the idea of a wealth tax argue that it has a bumpy track record. While 12 European countries had a wealth tax in 1990, Greg Rosalsky writes in NPR, only three (Norway, Spain and Switzerland) still do. He writes:

According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries — and, perhaps worst of all, it didn’t raise much revenue.

An economist and leading inequality scholar who has advised Ms. Warren, Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, says that her wealth tax is designed with those failures in mind, since it applies only to the ultra-wealthy, taxes citizens wherever they live and imposes a 40 percent “exit tax” on Americans worth more than $50 million who renounce their citizenship.

Still others oppose the idea on principle, for the very reasons many support it. Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, writes in Bloomberg:

Warren’s wealth tax would be an abuse of government power. It is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions. What is wrong with the way these 75,000 families made their money? Paying taxes is not a punishment, and the tax code should not be used to penalize any group of citizens. Not even the very rich.

A wealth tax is only a start

A wealth tax could close the country’s wealth gap from the top, and the universal social programs it helps fund could go some way to closing the wealth gap at the bottom. But more targeted redistributive measures, like reparations, may be needed to completely close the gap between blacks and whites, argues William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University. He told The Times:

That’s an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now. Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you’re really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific.

Some on the left have also criticized the idea of a wealth tax as utopian in its belief that those at capitalism’s helm would steer the system in a direction it by nature does not want to go. To fix the problem at the root, writes Benjamin Kunkel in The London Review of Books, imagine a market socialist revolution through which the shares of all corporations are transferred into public hands. With ownership of the means of production more evenly distributed, inequality wouldn’t deepen automatically as Mr. Piketty says it does under capitalism. Mr. Kunkel writes:

The notion of such a revolution — first in one country, then gatheringly international but not yet universal — is fanciful right now. But is it more so than a global capital tax requiring the coordination of virtually all nations? … Socialist revolution frankly seems more likely. … Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits.

THE TAKEAWAY

In “Capital,” Mr. Piketty himself wrote that his idea of a progressive global wealth tax was indeed “utopian.” Yet he also said that the United States, producing as it does a quarter of global G.D.P., wouldn’t need to “ask permission” from other countries to pioneer the policy."

That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.”

In addition to its public statements, Mr. Biden’s campaign has warned off some Democrats from participating in a super PAC. One prominent Democrat, David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had been approached about being involved in the pro-Biden super PAC but had declined to do so after the campaign urged him against it.

Mr. Riddle said a final decision about whether to deploy a super PAC for Mr. Biden would be made in “the coming weeks.”

Mr. Biden clearly needs to jolt his campaign, which has lost ground in the early nominating states to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been largely unscathed by her rivals. And the vice president’s longtime friends increasingly believe that Ms. Warren’s growing strength — along with Mr. Trump’s offensive — is reason enough to risk the backlash they would get from their opponents and campaign finance reform advocates for creating a group reliant on large contributions. But Mr. Riddle said there had been no final decision on whether to proceed with a super PAC, in part because of this risk. Mr. Biden’s two leading competitors for his party’s nomination, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme of their campaigns. And Mr. Biden has already drawn criticism for his comparative reliance on wealthy donors to fund his candidacy.

“I’m mindful that any effort to do this is going to be disowned by the campaign because of the way Warren has replayed her hand,” said Mr. Rasky, alluding to the senator’s decision not to solicit large campaign checks as a presidential candidate, despite having done so in her Senate campaign.

Mr. Riddle said that any pro-Biden advertising would be focused on responding to attacks from Mr. Trump and Republicans, rather than targeting other Democrats.

Despite Mr. Munger’s presence at the meeting last week, Mr. Riddle said Mr. Munger was not involved in devising the pro-Biden group and had not contributed any money so far. Mr. Munger is the son of Charles Munger, a billionaire who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment firm."

But there’s a strong political argument for moving the process forward this year, given that it gets harder for Democrats to make their case as the election nears — and voters could throw Mr. Trump out of office anyhow. Historically, the process has taken about four months.

How likely is it that Mr. Trump will be removed from office at the end of all this?

Not very. There are no signs that Senate Republicans have any appetite for investigating Mr. Trump. To reach a two-thirds majority in the Senate, at least 20 Republicans would have to vote with every Democrat to remove Mr. Trump from office.

No House Republicans and only two Senate Republicans back any kind of investigation into Mr. Trump. Here’s how Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who described the allegations against Mr. Trump as “deeply troubling,” explained his party’s resistance earlier this week:

There’s such enormous power associated with being the party in power, both in the White House as well as in the Senate and the House. … I think it’s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that’s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power.

How does this effect the 2020 election?

This clearly leads to a Joe Walsh surge in Arizona, a Joe Sestak victory in North Dakota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropping out of the race to become a professor of 16th century art history.

Seriously, though, no one really knows.

As my colleague Reid Epstein and I wrote today, it’s probably not great for the lower-polling candidates, who will now face an even greater struggle to get media attention.

How it impacts the front-runners in the race — Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren — is a topic of great debate within Democratic circles right now. We’ve never seen an impeachment inquiry quite like this, leaving the candidates, strategists and assorted prognosticators navigating uncharted political waters.

Also important to remember: Mr. Trump can run for re-election even if he’s impeached by the House. And maybe even if he’s removed by the Senate, too."

In a private chat room, pro-Trump internet trolls discussed which memes, videos and news stories to push on social media in order to reclaim the narrative.

The last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access. AOL and Yahoo were the biggest websites in the world, and “tweet” was a sound birds made.

If the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event.

But behind the scenes, many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have been grappling with a new reality: For the first time, a presidential primary will unfold with a sitting president seeking re-election while also facing an impeachment inquiry.

There is no political playbook for this. No pollster or strategist to speak from experience. What is clear, from interviews with advisers and allies with the various campaigns, is that the top candidates like Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren believe they are sufficiently established in the race that they can continue to command attention for their candidacies and messages. Second-tier and third-tier candidates, however, are at much greater risk of falling off the radar screen for an electorate that may soon be at a standstill, distracted by an impeachment circus in Washington.

Capitalism needs a wealth tax

The idea of a wealth tax is not new, but it gained mainstream popularity with the publication in 2013 of the French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the book that launched a thousand think pieces. Mr. Piketty, who has expressed support for both Ms. Warren’s and Mr. Sanders’s campaigns, argued that a capitalist economy inevitably produces wealth inequality that is self-perpetuating and, if left unchecked, “potentially terrifying.” He wrote:

When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.

To avert what he calls “patrimonial capitalism,” where rich people get ever richer only by virtue of being rich in the first place, Mr. Piketty prescribed a global wealth tax, progressing from 1 percent on assets of one million euros to 5 to 10 percent on assets above a billion euros (as well as an “optimal” top marginal income tax in developed countries around 80 percent).

“Short of that, many may turn against globalization,” he wrote with prescience in The Financial Times in 2014. “If, one day, they found a common voice, it would speak the disremembered mantras of nationalism and economic isolation.”

A wealth tax may not work

Even those sympathetic to the spirit of a wealth tax acknowledge that there are considerable pragmatic obstacles to its implementation. Even if there were sufficient political will to pass it, it could face a constitutional challenge. Megan McArdle , a libertarian Washington Post columnist, writes:

The big problem is Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids “direct taxes” on people or property unless they’re “apportioned” — doled out among the states by population. Instituting an income tax required a constitutional amendment to override that clause, and Warren’s plan might well require another.

Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have cited numerous legal experts who say a wealth tax would be constitutional. But with the Supreme Court’s composition being what it is, the question is far from settled.

There’s also the matter of enforcement. As Paul Krugman notes, the wealthy are quite good at avoiding taxes and evading them illegally. And because many assets owned by the ultra-wealthy — like artwork and diamonds — aren’t always traded on the market, Ms. McArdle writes, taxing them would mean “creating a lot of administrative capacity to track and price the assets, with the wealthy and their lawyers fighting every step of the way.”

“If these difficulties prove insurmountable,” writes Noah Smith, a left-leaning economist, in Bloomberg, “Warren and other egalitarian tax crusaders might consider an alternative — an inheritance tax, which would close many of the loopholes that now riddle the U.S. estate tax.” He adds:

Taxing all income from inheritances — including trusts, foundations, gifts, estates, and any other kind of family transfers — at a very high rate would yield a result similar to a small annual wealth tax, only its constitutionality would be less in doubt. And it would focus the tax on the rich people whose fortunes Americans are most likely to think of as being undeserved.

A wealth tax is a bad idea

Skeptics of the idea of a wealth tax argue that it has a bumpy track record. While 12 European countries had a wealth tax in 1990, Greg Rosalsky writes in NPR, only three (Norway, Spain and Switzerland) still do. He writes:

According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries — and, perhaps worst of all, it didn’t raise much revenue.

An economist and leading inequality scholar who has advised Ms. Warren, Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, says that her wealth tax is designed with those failures in mind, since it applies only to the ultra-wealthy, taxes citizens wherever they live and imposes a 40 percent “exit tax” on Americans worth more than $50 million who renounce their citizenship.

Still others oppose the idea on principle, for the very reasons many support it. Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, writes in Bloomberg:

Warren’s wealth tax would be an abuse of government power. It is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions. What is wrong with the way these 75,000 families made their money? Paying taxes is not a punishment, and the tax code should not be used to penalize any group of citizens. Not even the very rich.

A wealth tax is only a start

A wealth tax could close the country’s wealth gap from the top, and the universal social programs it helps fund could go some way to closing the wealth gap at the bottom. But more targeted redistributive measures, like reparations, may be needed to completely close the gap between blacks and whites, argues William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University. He told The Times:

That’s an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now. Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you’re really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific.

Some on the left have also criticized the idea of a wealth tax as utopian in its belief that those at capitalism’s helm would steer the system in a direction it by nature does not want to go. To fix the problem at the root, writes Benjamin Kunkel in The London Review of Books, imagine a market socialist revolution through which the shares of all corporations are transferred into public hands. With ownership of the means of production more evenly distributed, inequality wouldn’t deepen automatically as Mr. Piketty says it does under capitalism. Mr. Kunkel writes:

The notion of such a revolution — first in one country, then gatheringly international but not yet universal — is fanciful right now. But is it more so than a global capital tax requiring the coordination of virtually all nations? … Socialist revolution frankly seems more likely. … Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits.

THE TAKEAWAY

In “Capital,” Mr. Piketty himself wrote that his idea of a progressive global wealth tax was indeed “utopian.” Yet he also said that the United States, producing as it does a quarter of global G.D.P., wouldn’t need to “ask permission” from other countries to pioneer the policy."

That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.”

In addition to its public statements, Mr. Biden’s campaign has warned off some Democrats from participating in a super PAC. One prominent Democrat, David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had been approached about being involved in the pro-Biden super PAC but had declined to do so after the campaign urged him against it.

Mr. Riddle said a final decision about whether to deploy a super PAC for Mr. Biden would be made in “the coming weeks.”

Mr. Biden clearly needs to jolt his campaign, which has lost ground in the early nominating states to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been largely unscathed by her rivals. And the vice president’s longtime friends increasingly believe that Ms. Warren’s growing strength — along with Mr. Trump’s offensive — is reason enough to risk the backlash they would get from their opponents and campaign finance reform advocates for creating a group reliant on large contributions. But Mr. Riddle said there had been no final decision on whether to proceed with a super PAC, in part because of this risk. Mr. Biden’s two leading competitors for his party’s nomination, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme of their campaigns. And Mr. Biden has already drawn criticism for his comparative reliance on wealthy donors to fund his candidacy.

“I’m mindful that any effort to do this is going to be disowned by the campaign because of the way Warren has replayed her hand,” said Mr. Rasky, alluding to the senator’s decision not to solicit large campaign checks as a presidential candidate, despite having done so in her Senate campaign.

Mr. Riddle said that any pro-Biden advertising would be focused on responding to attacks from Mr. Trump and Republicans, rather than targeting other Democrats.

Despite Mr. Munger’s presence at the meeting last week, Mr. Riddle said Mr. Munger was not involved in devising the pro-Biden group and had not contributed any money so far. Mr. Munger is the son of Charles Munger, a billionaire who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment firm."

Their plans are as different as can be. Only Mr. Yang’s is practical.

Let’s start with some undeniable preliminaries. First, we live in a time of great economic inequality. Economists debate the roles of technology, trade and public policy in explaining this fact. But there is no doubt that disparities in income and wealth are far greater today than they were half a century ago.

Second, reasonable people can disagree about the role the government should play in addressing this inequality. The issue involves not just economics but also political philosophy. Like most people, I have opinions on this thorny question, but I won’t try to resolve it all here.

Instead, let’s consider a simpler question: Assume that one way or another, the government is going to pursue new policies to increase the equality of economic outcomes. Given that assumption, what is the best approach?"

The whistleblower’s complaint, released Thursday, concerns a July phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The controversy has become the biggest political danger to Mr. Trump’s presidency as it rallied House Democrats this week to launch impeachment proceedings.

In a private chat room, pro-Trump internet trolls discussed which memes, videos and news stories to push on social media in order to reclaim the narrative.

The last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access. AOL and Yahoo were the biggest websites in the world, and “tweet” was a sound birds made.

If the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event. The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls."

“Donald Trump is terrified of Joe Biden because the Vice President would beat him like a drum,” she said.

No evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son in his work in Ukraine.

Mr. Biden’s return to the campaign trail on Friday represented the start of a critical and unpredictable phase of his presidential bid: He is now not only running to lead the Democrats against Mr. Trump in 2020, but he is also grappling with a national spotlight on his family, and how to handle questions — and any potential political fallout — associated with his role in the Ukraine story line that House Democrats are now investigating.

Mr. Trump has been regularly attacking Mr. Biden and his son over their dealings with Ukraine, often using innuendo and falsehoods. The president has also delivered deeply personal insults about Hunter Biden, seemingly trying to bait the elder Mr. Biden into retaliating.

How Mr. Biden handles Mr. Trump’s constant broadsides — as well as questions from reporters and voters about Ukraine, impeachment and his son’s business history — will be a significant test for the candidate who has topped polls for much of the primary race but has seen his lead dip recently.

“You have to be strategic and thoughtful about how you respond and when you respond and the nature of your response,” said the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack, who attended a recent Biden fund-raiser but has not endorsed any candidate. “He has focused as much on the damage to the country, the concerns he has about misuse of power, as he has on the personal side of this.”"

The Democrats are united

For months, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had opposed impeachment proceedings on the grounds that they would further divide the country. As recently as Wednesday, she held firm. But on Friday, she changed her position and joined the other 18 Democratic presidential candidates on board with an impeachment inquiry.

“This inquiry must be swift, thorough and narrowly focused,” she said. “It cannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus.”

The candidates are not perfectly aligned — some have been more forceful than others, and some, like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful only to endorse the inquiry Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday, not necessarily impeachment itself."

Their plans are as different as can be. Only Mr. Yang’s is practical.

Let’s start with some undeniable preliminaries. First, we live in a time of great economic inequality. Economists debate the roles of technology, trade and public policy in explaining this fact. But there is no doubt that disparities in income and wealth are far greater today than they were half a century ago.

Second, reasonable people can disagree about the role the government should play in addressing this inequality. The issue involves not just economics but also political philosophy. Like most people, I have opinions on this thorny question, but I won’t try to resolve it all here.

Instead, let’s consider a simpler question: Assume that one way or another, the government is going to pursue new policies to increase the equality of economic outcomes. Given that assumption, what is the best approach?"

She’ll stand there looking up at him in the lights, and you’ll wonder if she’s trembling, cowering, because clearly she’s about to be crushed. And then she’ll take a brisk step forward and punch him hard and sharp in the kidney. And he’ll howl—“Aarrrrggg!”—because he’s surprised and it hurts and he assumed he’d easily chase her around the stage.

She’ll say, “Mr. President, I know everyone’s supposed to be afraid of you and your rough ways, but I don’t find you so tough. And I’m not afraid of you.” (Transcript: “Applause, cheers.”) Then she’ll call him soft, corrupt, incompetent—a phony martyr who doesn’t respect his own supporters enough to fake respectability.

He’ll call her a left-wing nut who’ll ruin the economy, destroy capitalism, kill our greatness, steal our private health insurance.

We’ll be off. And no one will know where it’s going.

That is my impeachment thought: Nobody knows where this is going. The politically obsessed may think they do, but something wild and unpredictable has been let loose. The charges are serious and credible. But America is as divided as it was in 2016, America is still in play, and it’s all up for grabs.

Everything, the entire outcome, will depend on public opinion.

The charge is that the American president went to the leader of Ukraine and invited him to take part in the 2020 presidential election by investigating one of the president’s likely competitors. Mr. Trump might have added pressure by delaying U.S. aid.

What is immediately striking is that no one who has spoken in defense of the president, including his spokesmen, has said these words: “Donald Trump would never do that!” Or, “That would be unlike him!” That will be the president’s problem as public opinion develops: everyone knows he would do it, everyone knows it is like him. There’s no mystique of goodness to be destroyed.

If everything depends on public opinion then a lot depends on how the House comports itself. Will the Democrats be sober, steady, fair-minded? Or will they be disorganized divas who play to their base and win over no one else? Are they capable of rising to the moment?

The guess here is that articles of impeachment will be drawn, presented and pass the House.

Impeachment is a grave constitutional and governmental act, but it is also a political one that requires public support. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has calculated that the case is strong and the people will come along. She wouldn’t have moved forward if she didn’t think she was going to win. The president is wrong when he says she’s finally bowed to the mad progressives of her party, who are so colorfully belligerent, who last summer pushed to impeach William Barr and last week wanted to impeach Brett Kavanaugh. Mrs. Pelosi is an attentive vote-counter and a practical pol. I think she’s moving now because she thinks she got him and the jig is up.

At an off-the-record meeting in New York Monday, the night before she announced the impeachment push, she looked like someone whose old hesitation was gone. In its place was the joy of the hunt.

As for the Senate, the understandable and previously reliable common wisdom was that Republicans there will keep the needed 67 votes for conviction from materializing. That’s probably still likely, but it’s no sure thing. Tuesday the Senate voted unanimously for the whistleblower’s complaint to be made public. (On Thursday it was.) Senators didn’t say, “This is just another partisan witch hunt. Grrr grrr.” Why not? Because the charges were serious and they couldn’t refuse to ask for more information. Because they wanted to signal to the White House that they couldn’t accept the idea that aid to Ukraine could have been held up over something like this. Because they had to assume more bad information was coming. And because they’re four years into the Trump era and are tired of having to excuse and explain everything the president does that is surprising, illogical, unprofessional, dubious.

Most of them wouldn’t miss him if he were gone. They’d happily peel off if public opinion back home seemed to shift.

Among Trump supporters right now, the Ukraine story would look like a Washington-centric phony drama—more partisan nonsense, business as usual, ignore it. But if the story gets bad, if it comes to be thought of as a real national-security question, as the whistleblower charged in his report, they will pay attention and care.

So much depends on who’s called to testify and what they say and how ugly a picture they paint.

Wholly anecdotal but perhaps significant, I heard this week from two separate Trump supporters, one in the past passionate, the other whose support was always softer, who shared their dismay at the Ukraine story. Both said these words: “Maybe Pence wouldn’t be so bad.” They were exhausted by the drama and wrongness. Why not the man with the soft white hair?

In the end, in purely practical political terms, the one person who will be hurt by this story will be Joe Biden. Every telling of this story necessitates pointing out that Mr. Biden’s son Hunter had cozy financial relationships with other countries, including Ukraine. It’s real swamp stuff. It looks bad, say the former vice president’s friends. No, it is bad.

It is infuriating that members of America’s leadership class so often show themselves to the world as self-enriching. As a nation we spent the 20th century presenting ourselves to the world as a truly moral leader, a self sacrificing country, one to be looked up to. In the 21st century our political figures and their families too often look like scrounging grifters—Americans with connections who can be hired, who leverage connections to fame for profit. There’s a fairly constant air of soft corruption, of an easy, seamy reality of big-power back scratching.

It makes America look bad. It makes us look weak and craven, like we can be bought.

There should be something called the Class Act. If you have any class, you don’t profit financially from a relative in power in the world’s greatest democracy. You don’t embarrass your country that way. Because, you know, you have class. You’re lucky to be from a respected family. A president or vice president might say, “It’s unfair to make my child sacrifice a deal because of what his father does!” Actually, no one asked you to ask for power; no one told you to want it. If you get it, it’s an honor. Do your job. Yes, your family should sacrifice, as should you.

The story of Hunter Biden and his business adventures isn’t new, and yet sometimes stories come alive in new ways. This one will probably come into focus for a while and be emblematic of the swamp.

Joe Biden probably thought it was old news, already dissected and dismissed. But it’s back, and will hit him like a kidney punch."

There is, I’d argue, an important clue in the “Obama rage” that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.

Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama’s rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama’s gentle rebukes provoked fury — and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.

The point is that many of the superrich aren’t satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year’s election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.

And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat — not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication — has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? — makes her critique much harder to dismiss.

If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?

Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.

Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for F.D.R., who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”"

Deploys an Old Tactic",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-fired-teaching.html,"Mr. Trump has slurred Ms. Warren for years over her ancestry claims, and the personal attacks on her come out of the Trump playbook from 2016 that targeted both Republicans and Mrs. Clinton. Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an adviser for former Gov. Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump would need to “tear down” whoever is the eventual Democratic nominee in order to win re-election, given his low approval ratings.

“One of Senator Warren’s great strengths is her ability to connect her biography to her record to her plans for the future,” he said. “That gets undermined if she can’t rely on her biography as the foundation of that progression.”

All year, Ms. Warren has framed her personal story to voters as one of perseverance , focusing on her upbringing in Oklahoma, her family’s financial struggles and her winding path to an eventual career as a law professor. Voters often praise her biographical story as a powerful part of her pitch , which centers on bringing about big change to an economic and political system that she describes as rigged against ordinary people .

As part of that story, Ms. Warren tells crowds that at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was “visibly pregnant” and lost her job. A retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school in New Jersey told CBS News, “The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant.”

Teachers in the United States were commonly pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy at the time, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which barred employers from treating pregnant women differently from other people “similar in their ability or inability to work,” but claims of discrimination persist to this day.

“These attacks on Senator Warren are absurd,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the presidential race in August. “Of course pregnancy discrimination was a serious problem in 1971, and it continues to be a widespread issue today despite a law banning it. The stories that women are sharing are real and powerful.”

Regardless, the Republican National Committee dismissed Ms. Warren’s description of losing her job, citing a 2007 interview in which she discussed her public-school teaching career but did not mention being forced out, as well as records showing that the school board had approved a contract for Ms. Warren for the next school year."

“Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That’s not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,” he added. “But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.”

Ms. Warren has built her campaign around a call for “big, structural change” and has garnered significant support by releasing a series of detailed policy proposals like the one on how she would break up giant tech companies.

Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg’s remarks, Ms. Warren responded on Twitter. And she did not mince words.

“What would really ‘suck,’” she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg’s language, “is if we don’t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.”"

In the first exchange, Ms. Warren, who is from Massachusetts, was asked repeatedly how she would pay for “Medicare for all” and insisted that costs would not increase for middle-class Americans. But she would not say outright that taxes would or would not increase.

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has championed a single-payer system, said taxes would go up for “virtually everybody.” But he added that the tax increase would be substantially less than what people currently pay for premiums and out-of-pocket health care expenses.

“At least Bernie is being honest here, and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said after his comments."

Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her “credibility.”

Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren’s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for “Medicare for all,” a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months.

“It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,” Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center."

Their tax proposals are helping to galvanize those on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too liberal.

Polls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, backed a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren’s plan.

The proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions.

[The latest data and analysis to keep track of who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.]

On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the superrich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, “how about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?”

Mr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America’s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States.

“There’s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,” Mr. Sanders said. “This is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.”"

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate.

That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg.

While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views.

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

Ms. Warren has become known for her towering stack of policy plans, having offered dozens of proposals on a wide variety of subjects. But on health care, she has not been similarly forthcoming, and her repeated refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance Medicare for all has drawn sharp criticism from some of her Democratic presidential rivals.

Given her increasing status as a front-runner in the primary race, Ms. Warren was ce rtain to continue facing challenges on the issue. For weeks, she has sidestepped questions about raising taxes, no matter who was asking and when. But it had been an open question whether it would remain politically tenable for her to continue simply aligning herself with Senator Bernie Sanders’s health care plan while declining to provide any detailed explanation of how she would pay for it.

Ms. Warren brought up the issue of Medicare for all at the end of a town-hall-style event in Iowa on Sunday afternoon. “I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about, specifically, the cost of Medicare for all and, specifically, how we pay for it,” she told the crowd at the event, held at Simpson College."

African-Americans were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primary contests and capturing the nomination. Like those earlier candidates, Ms. Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination.

At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before. I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I’ve been there, and I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office.

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it.

You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don’t even try because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it.

And when it comes to the tech sector, that has meant taking square aim at giant companies like Facebook — companies she says have become so large that they are stifling competition.

Ms. Warren rolled out a proposal to break up Facebook, Amazon and other tech giants in March. To ensure that tech workers got her message, her campaign paid for a billboard near a major transit station in San Francisco. It read “Break Up Big Tech,” in capital letters.

On Tuesday, nearly seven months after Ms. Warren first unveiled her plan, The Verge offered a window into what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, thinks about it. In leaked audio recordings of open meetings with employees this summer, Mr. Zuckerberg can be heard saying that the company would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the plan as president.

A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in July found that 72 percent of Democratic voters nationwide, largely liberals, said they would support a taxpayer-funded, single-payer health care system. Even moderate and conservative Democratic voters supported the idea, at 57 percent. Younger Democratic voters were particularly likely to back a single-payer system.

But support was mushier across party lines, according to the poll. Just 44 percent of all American voters supported a single-payer plan funded by taxes.

And when given a choice between Medicare for all and a public option, even Democrats remain split.

In a July study, Pew researchers found that 4 in 5 Democrats believed it was the government’s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health care. But in a follow-up question on how it should be administered, just 44 percent of all Democrats favored a Medicare for all model, while an additional 34 percent said they would like to see a public option operating alongside private insurers — the approach favored by Mr. Biden and more moderate Democrats.

Among the general population, just over a quarter of Americans said they would choose a Medicare for all-type system, according to the Pew survey.

Who’s Paying?

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have made two claims central to their candidacies: that only Medicare for all would be enough to make health care affordable for every American, and that the richest Americans ought to pay far more in taxes than they currently do."

In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled some of these policies unconstitutional. But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse.

CBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy.

“The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,” Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. “But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”

At issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren’s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren’s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade.

“I loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,” she told a crowd in Nevada last week. “By the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

She included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year , she said the principal “showed me the door.”"

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

But she should not have been surprised.

For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for “big structural change” took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren’s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all.

This time, Mr. O’Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump’s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was “being vague” in campaign proposals.

This was Ms. Warren’s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. “A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point."

It Was the Worst of Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/democratic-debate-ohio.html,"All of this was to be expected. All of it was, in fact, a great compliment to Warren. During both the opening stretch of the debate and subsequent ones, her prescriptions were the point of reference, her priorities set the terms of the discussion, and she was the candidate to whom the debate’s moderators kept returning so that she could respond to her rivals’ invocations of her.

And she stayed cool and confident under fire, sounding more grateful for the spotlight than fearful of the microscope. It was, for the most part, a fine performance.

But it was also, at first, an exasperating one. That unwillingness to talk candidly about middle-class taxes, though she was pressed by both a moderator and by other candidates to do so, bordered on perverse.

She kept saying, as if it were a tic or a stutter, that “costs will go down” for middle-class families, the translation of which is that taxes might well go up but that those families would be economically ahead of the game in the end.

If that’s the case, why not be explicit about the arithmetic and own it? If there’s nothing to hide from, why hide from it? Warren has campaigned as a truth teller but came across, in this instance, as a classically evasive Washington operator, scared to treat voters as grown-ups who can process information in a sophisticated manner."

Warren’s policy ideas would make any progressive-moderate coalition impossible. She’d try to govern with her 40 percent partisan base, just as Trump has, which is no way to pass big legislation.

Fourth, there is a wave of insular intolerance coursing through parts of the American left. If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own.

And yet ….

And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You’re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation’s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.

Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat — to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.

Last week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back.

Furthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I’ve thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he’ll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated , unhinged and unwell.

In their book “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties."

Warren’s reticence to admit that the Medicare for All proposal she’s backed would raise middle-class taxes is understandable, argues Michelle Goldberg, but her embrace of Bernie Sanders’s plan is also a liability. Ross Douthat thinks Joe Biden is depriving other more moderate candidates, including Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, of political oxygen.

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

Ms. Warren said she opposed Mr. Trump’s handling of the situation but believed the United States should “get out of the Middle East.” (Aides to Ms. Warren said she was referring to the withdrawal of troops from combat.)

Throughout the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, Mr. Biden played a far less central role than he did in the past, stepping to the foreground for exchanges over foreign policy but otherwise taking a more passive approach. His most important moment of the night may have come early on, when he was pressed by a moderator to explain why his son had not crossed any ethical lines by doing business in Ukraine while his father was overseeing diplomacy there for the Obama administration.

Mr. Biden said several times that he and his son had done “nothing wrong,” and alluded repeatedly to an interview Hunter Biden gave to ABC News, in which he said it had been an error in judgment to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, often in false or exaggerated terms, and his efforts to enlist the government of Ukraine in tarring Mr. Biden instigated an impeachment inquiry.

This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting — and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread.

CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues.

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

It followed Mr. Trump’s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to “end the endless wars.”"

Most of the Democratic candidates have proposed some form of subsidized child care or public preschool, and some say that a corresponding subsidy for at-home caregivers would allow parents to choose who cares for their children. (President Trump made a similar proposal when he was running for president, but did not include it in his tax plan.)

But they’re also acknowledging something else: Often, staying home is not really a choice at all. If parents’ jobs are too inflexible to accommodate children’s needs, or pay too little to afford child care, taking care of their child has to come first.

As long as people have debated the idea, there has been disagreement over whether paying women for unpaid labor is liberating or oppressive.

In the United States in the late 1800s, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, the writer and social reformer, wrote that unpaid labor took away women’s independence and ought to be done by paid experts. Around the same time, the United States for a period paid single mothers a pension, on the belief that it was best for children if mothers did not work outside the home (though black women were largely excluded).

The idea resurfaced during the feminist movement of the 1970s. That period is well known for the rush of women into the work force. But there was a parallel movement, which began in Europe and spread to the United States: wages for housework. The argument was that women should be paid for the work they were already doing, and that men’s paid work depended on it, as Louise Toupin described in a history of the movement last year.

Similar debates continue today in countries that pay a child allowance. In Finland, for example, the policy is seen as giving women “freedom to choose,” while in Sweden, it has been called a “trap for women.” (The policies are usually gender-neutral, but it’s mostly women who use them.)"

Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday."

Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.”

The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800.

Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to “make sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources” they need. She also said Ms. Warren was “not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,” including “no special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.”

Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week.

The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the last three months.

Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren’s proposed arrangement left him confused.

“I don’t even know how that would work,” Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, “have to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in.”"

For many young, progressive Americans, democratic socialism is a far better representation of their ambitions of far-reaching structural change across the economy and society than the agenda of the Democratic Party, which they see as overly influenced by corporate interests, big-money donors and moderate traditionalists.

The attempt at Ohio State to define objectives also comes as the Democratic presidential contenders are locked in a battle over what direction the party should take in order to win in 2020. That dynamic will be on display Tuesday night less than 15 miles from O.S.U., when the candidates gather for the fourth primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville.

Two top candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have successfully pushed the primary conversation to the left. The D.S.A. saw drastic growth in its membership when Mr. Sanders, himself a democratic socialist, ran for president in 2016, and there are now nearly 60,000 members across the country. (Ms. Warren, who has pulled ahead of Mr. Sanders in polling and is a leading candidate for the nomination, backs many of the same progressive priorities as Mr. Sanders, but has also said she is “a capitalist to my bones.”)"

“Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement,” a narrator in the ad intoned.

The video wasn’t released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network’s policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.

In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders’ speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.

“This is a most basic test,” Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said in the letter. “The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected.”"

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party."

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

Continuing the fight with Facebook

In a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, argued forcefully against the idea that the social network should be an arbiter of speech, doubling down on a stance that has drawn wide condemnation as the company continues to face accusations of amplifying disinformation.

Ms. Warren renewed that criticism after Mr. Zuckerberg’s speech, saying late Thursday in a tweet: “Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again — and profit off of it.”

The comments continued an increasingly public feud between Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Warren. Earlier this month, Ms. Warren bought a political ad on Facebook that purposefully included the false claim that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook backed Mr. Trump’s re-election — and essentially dared the social network to remove it. (Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Facebook has endorsed a candidate.)

Mr. Zuckerberg at one point invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point about free speech, which drew a response from one of Dr. King’s daughters, Bernice King. “I’d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,” she wrote on Twitter. “These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.”"

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing.

Let’s start with pessimism: Some people are burned out. In her book “American Resistance: From the Women’s March to the Blue Wave,” Dana Fisher, a professor at the University of Maryland, described how a series of “moral shocks” propelled people who hadn’t thought of themselves as activists to join protests. But after three years of Trumpism, it takes more to shock people than it used to. “People have grown accustomed to a certain baseline level of outrage,” Fisher told me.

But that’s far from the whole story. Fisher surveyed people at the Women’s March and other demonstrations, and then tracked them afterward, doing follow-up surveys six months before the midterms and two days after. “All of their levels of civic engagement went up,” she said.

Many had called elected officials and attended town halls. Now, she says, much of the Resistance is focused on organizing for presidential candidates, particularly Elizabeth Warren. “One of the reasons we’re seeing less protest is that protest is being seen as the beginning of activism and political involvement rather than being the end,” she said.

So if America isn’t seeing the sort of huge demonstrations roiling other countries, it’s at least in part because those most fiercely opposed to Trump still believe in the power of our democracy to get rid of him. “People actually trust the election to sort it out,” said Chenoweth. “This is something that’s common in democracies — when you start to see a protest wave really pick up, a lot of time that mobilization really gets filtered into the next election.”

But the next election is a year away, and American democracy is in danger now. You can’t count on an election to restrain the president when the president is using the power of his office to subvert the election with foreign interference. Each day, it seems, Trump and those around him become increasingly brazen in their lawbreaking."

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy.

Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

It’s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans.

Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past?

Whither Mayor Pete?

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls.

So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by “West Wing”-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

Does anyone else break out of the pack?

Madison recognized that “the people” can be as tyrannical as a monarch. It is not enough, he wrote in Federalist 51, “to guard the society against the oppression of the rulers”; it is equally necessary “to guard one part of the society against the oppression of the other part.” What we now call a “liberal democracy” is a state where majoritarianism is tempered by a respect for individual rights as well as the rights of political or ethnic minorities.

The opposite of liberalism is not conservatism, as we understand the term in modern America, but populism. The illiberal populism of Donald Trump, Hungary’s Viktor Orban or Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, each of whom was more or less fairly elected, entails the cynical and reckless use of the mechanisms of democracy to disenfranchise political minorities, politicize the state, stigmatize immigrants and other “outsiders,” and diminish civil liberties. Populists address an exclusionary “us.” As Mr. Trump himself once put it with rare clarity, “The only important thing is the unification of the people — because the other people don’t mean anything.” Populism is democracy without liberalism.

We suffer from a confusion of terms, and not only in regard to liberalism. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are routinely referred to as “populists,” including in this newspaper, presumably because they assail the rich. But so did Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, as in ours, the rich vacuumed up almost all the value produced by the economy. Does pointing that out make you a populist? Does denying that claim, or endorsing the virtues of gross inequality, mean that you are not a populist? The thought is absurd. None of the Democratic candidates would talk about, or treat, “the people” as Mr. Trump has done. They are not populists. Are they liberals? Bernie Sanders — who calls himself a socialist, opposes free trade and shows very little regard for the working of the free market — is not. I have my doubts about Elizabeth Warren. But they’re not populists either.

Today, paradoxically, it is not liberals but conservatives who endanger liberalism. The secular, free-market conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan accepted the basic apparatus of a liberal society. But Mr. Reagan also welcomed into the party extremists and conservative evangelicals who thought about politics in far more absolute terms. Over time, those groups took over the host body of the Republicans, leaving us with an illiberal party that represents half the country. Today’s Republican leaders, with the vehement support of their base, have threatened the autonomy of the federal and state judiciary, treated intelligence and law-enforcement agencies as instruments of the “deep state,” attacked the press and pulled down the empire of science, reason and fact into the mire of “fake news.”

It may be that a combination of the impending impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and a Democratic victory in 2020 will break the illiberal fever. Certainly any imaginable Democratic victor would put an end to attacks on the government and the press. But it is not, in the end, the formal rules and institutions that sustain liberal democracy. It is the widespread faith in them, what we call “norms.” Forty years of swelling illiberalism on the right — and some reciprocal illiberalism on the left — have deeply corroded that faith."

So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.

“I’m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him — this is not a family business,” Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on “Good Morning America’’ and was also excerpted online by the network. “Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it’s a compliment that we’re like the Kennedys or whether it’s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you’re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump’s kids and I never will, you know, that’s not what Bidens do.”

At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens.

“Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,” he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.”

In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

“I’m taking it off the table,” he said. “I’m making that commitment. Let’s see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that’s the commitment that I’m making.”"

Here are some reasons Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is endorsing Mr. Sanders:

They are both unabashed socialists: From his call for universal health care coverage to her campaign for a Green New Deal, both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have eagerly sought to push the Democratic Party further left than nearly any of their colleagues.

He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it’s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.

He routinely steers clear of extremes — on health care, on guns, on environmental issues — not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I’m sitting, but because extremes aren’t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He’s a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.

But, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn’t mean a 37-year-old one. There’s much wisdom in this life that’s accrued only with the passage of years, and he’d be better off — and significantly less vulnerable in a general election — if he had even five more of them.

In 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline “The First Gay President?” I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he’d extended his résumé beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.

I’d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren’t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.

And that’s where my depression sets in. He’s so very strong but so crucially weak — which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets.

Speaking at a campaign rally hours after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a cease-fire, Mr. Trump defended his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, effectively clearing the way for a brutal Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had fought for years alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

The president’s decision to pull out drew rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans, who accused him of abandoning America’s friends. But Mr. Trump said the violence of the past week was useful. “It was unconventional what I did,” he acknowledged. “Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids,” he added. “Then you pull them apart.”

“Let’s have some real talk,” Ms. Harris said in Reno. “This is not a new conversation for me. This is a conversation that I’ve heard every time I’ve ran a campaign and — here’s the operative word — won.”

In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates — such as South Carolina, Nevada and California, her home state — while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.

It was a risky bet made with California confidence, that they would not only boost a candidate with the potential to make history but also do so without prioritizing Iowa and New Hampshire, a strategy that is unproven on the national stage and a break from Barack Obama’s successful playbook in 2008.

But after the fleeting high of Ms. Harris’s much-talked-about exchange with Mr. Biden over segregation and school busing in the first Democratic debate, it became clear that several assumptions underpinning that national strategy were not in line with the current moment.

Mr. Biden’s support soon bounced back, fueled by perceptions that he was best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, which remains the obsessive top priority for most Democratic voters. Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters has been particularly difficult for Ms. Harris to match, and some of her own supporters from within the Congressional Black Caucus told her privately they felt the debate moment had crossed a line.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have also dictated the policy terms of the primary and the debates, pulling Ms. Harris between the dueling worlds of progressives advocating structural change and Mr. Biden’s yesteryear centrism. She prefers neither."

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who advised Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign but is not working for anyone in the 2020 race, said the lack of cash would limit Mr. Biden’s political options. He pointed to the variety of areas where campaigns might want to invest money: airing television ads, deploying staff on the ground, staging splashy but expensive events and running a robust digital program.

“Your strategic options are limited,” Mr. Devine said, adding that the options available to Mr. Biden’s better-funded rivals were “much bigger.”

“He’s going to have to place the right bet,” Mr. Devine said. “It’s going to have to be a winner. It’s almost like you’re playing roulette, and one guy gets five numbers and the other guy gets one number. Who’s going to win?”

Over the summer, Mr. Biden had already begun to slash his digital spending budget, which was also clear in the new fillings. He spent about $1 million in the first half of the quarter and about $311,000 in the second half, records show.

During the quarter, Mr. Biden also spent $924,000 on a charter jet company, Advanced Aviation Team, as he raced across the country not only for rallies and speeches but also for dozens of fund-raisers on both coasts. Mr. Biden’s campaign said the costs included paying for carbon offsets.

Mr. Biden’s biggest expense is his payroll, which cost about $6.8 million in the past three months, records show. Mr. Biden had roughly 440 people on his payroll — about as many as Mr. Buttigieg — while Ms. Warren had more than 600 and Mr. Sanders had about 550."

Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors. More recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other top rivals have outspent Mr. Biden online: He was only the sixth-biggest Democratic spender on Facebook ads in the seven days ending Saturday, even as he began spending more money on digital ads targeting President Trump, Ukraine and impeachment."

In this race’s early stages, Ms. Harris showed all the signs of a possible coalition candidate, merging liberals and more moderate minority voters behind the strength of her historic bid to become the country’s first woman of color elected president. On the race’s first day, she raised $1.5 million, and she soon held a kickoff rally in Oakland, Calif., that remains one of the largest events for any candidate, with more than 20,000 people in attendance.

However, as the race has matured, Ms. Harris has been outflanked in money and ideology. Mr. Buttigieg has become the favorite of big money donors, and advisers for Mr. Biden, the race’s most prominent moderate candidate, are now considering a super PAC to supplement his coffers.

On the grass-roots side, progressives have centralized behind their two preferred candidates: Mr. Sanders, who retains many supporters from his previous presidential run, and Ms. Warren, who has grown her fund-raising base as her poll numbers have risen. She has outpaced Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in recent polls, both nationally and in a few early-voting states.

Ms. Harris’s team is adamant that she remains well-positioned — and adequately funded — to mount a vigorous operation in Iowa. As Mr. Biden’s poll numbers fade, Ms. Harris’s advisers believe her campaign is likely to gain from this and can use a strong initial showing to centralize black voters in later states. Recently, Ms. Harris shook up her senior staff, in a move that was first reported by Politico, and was taken as an acknowledgment of the campaign’s tough road ahead."

Extended drones, chantlike repeating phrases, tolling chords, spacious reverberation: Those are meditative sounds, defying fracture or interruption, tuning out the momentary and the trivial, invoking concentration, absorption, ritual and rapture. It’s the kind of music Nick Cave has chosen for “Ghosteen,” his 17th studio album leading the Bad Seeds.

Cave has been prolific and chameleonic since the early 1980s, when he emerged with the Birthday Party, the Australian post-punk band whose jagged songs introduced Cave’s lifelong fascination with humanity’s extremes: evil and transcendence, desire and violence, perdition and redemption, creation and annihilation. He started the Bad Seeds after the Birthday Party disbanded in 1983; since then he has written books, acted in and scored films (with the Bad Seeds’ longtime musical director, Warren Ellis) and also led a raucously collaborative band, Grinderman. His music never settled into any idiom for long.

“Ghosteen” is an eerie, somber monolith, a set of 11 songs that stretches over an hour and is grouped on two CDs. “The songs on the first album are the children. The songs on the second album are their parents. Ghosteen is a migrating spirit,” Cave wrote.

Throughout “Ghosteen,” the tempos are slow and slower, as songs circle through a handful of chords or hover in place while tension builds. Although the Bad Seeds still have the lineup of a rock band, on “Ghosteen” drums and guitars are almost entirely absent, replaced by the disembodied, sustained tones of synthesizers and string sections — built from Ellis’s violin — behind Cave’s brooding baritone, singing or speaking. Cave foreshadowed the approach with songs on “The Skeleton Tree” in 2016 — “Girl in Amber,” “Magneto” and “Distant Sky” — but those were interludes. This is a whole."

Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it’s remarkably consolidated.

There is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30 percent of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.

So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive."

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

As a young player, Zeile found the differences disorienting. In time, though, he grew fond of the Montreal’s art and architecture and came to view trips there almost as brief European excursions. But by 2003, when he played for the Expos, the team was splitting its home games with San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Expos ranked last in the N.L. in attendance in each of their final seven seasons, and Zeile said Olympic Stadium sounded hollow, like an echo chamber.

Now the Rays are the team that struggles to draw, and Zeile sees some merit to their idea of eventually splitting home games with Montreal, which M.L.B. has endorsed, at least in concept. But he said it would be hard for a team to win that way.

“It could be interesting from the perspective of trying to get the most out of a franchise that’s not getting full support in one home — but you don’t want to take the risk of having lack of support in two homes,” Zeile said.

“And there’s certainly going to be an opportunity cost when you consider that you’re going to feel like you’re on the road twice as much as you actually are. It’s hard to have two homes during the season and feel like you’re ever really coming home from a road trip.”

For Warren Cromartie, an Expos outfielder and first baseman from 1974 to ’83, the split-season option is more appealing. Cromartie is now the hitting coach for the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, but he has maintained close ties to Montreal, gathering an investment group to bring a team back to the city , which has staged popular spring training exhibitions and is targeting the Yankees for a visit next spring."

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

There is, I’d argue, an important clue in the “Obama rage” that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.

Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama’s rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama’s gentle rebukes provoked fury — and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.

The point is that many of the superrich aren’t satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year’s election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.

And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat — not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication — has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? — makes her critique much harder to dismiss.

If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?

Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.

Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for F.D.R., who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”"

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

Journalists have been badgering Warren to get specific about how much taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for all. She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.

The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.

The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-all plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.

But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.

The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.

So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?

Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

Public sentiment in favor of the inquiry is growing, even among a few Republicans, which makes the impeachment process itself less likely to be a purely partisan process.

Elizabeth Warren “s ticks by her story,” USA Today said. She “stands by account,” NBC News explained and “defends” it, according to The Wall Street Journal. CBS News put it this way: Warren “insists she was fired from a teaching job nearly 50 years ago because she was pregnant. A series of reports have questioned the story she’s been telling on the campaign trail.”

These descriptions all create an impression that Warren’s story is at least questionable and perhaps misleading. But the evidence suggests otherwise. From my reading of the stories, she has been telling the truth all along.

This mini-controversy has instead ended up highlighting problems not with Warren but with media coverage and political discourse. I see at least three:

Balance over accuracy. It is certainly true, as CBS noted, that some people have questioned Warren’s account. A story in the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, did so, as did a writer for Jacobin, a socialist publication.

Facebook is too powerful

The anti-monopolist spirit that animates Ms. Warren’s policy has found an unlikely vessel in Chris Hughes, who created Facebook with Mr. Zuckerberg when the two were roommates at Harvard. In a nearly 6,000-word Op-Ed for The Times, Mr. Hughes argues that Mr. Zuckerberg, whom he considers a “good, kind person,” simply has more influence over how businesses and people relate than any individual should. (Here are five takeaways from his piece.) “Mark’s power,” he says, “is unprecedented and un-American,” and must be curtailed. He writes:

Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world’s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.

Mr. Hughes contends that Facebook’s dominance prohibits would-be entrepreneurs from creating alternative social networks, suffocating innovation and restricting consumer choice. The damage extends to industries beyond tech, including journalism, whose business model was broken by Facebook’s and Google’s capture of digital advertising revenue. In warning about the dangers of Facebook’s monopolistic ambitions, Mr. Hughes cites Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor and the author of “The Curse of Bigness,” who told Wired’s editor, Nicholas Thompson:

Mark Zuckerberg wrote an email when he was acquiring Instagram that was disclosed in the New York Post, and it suggests he was buying Instagram because he saw it as a competitive threat. Now, it is a felony under U.S. law to buy companies that you believe are competitive threats to you. … The American way is that we believe in competition and that companies should fight it out, not buy each other when there’s serious competition.

But the most pernicious aspect of Facebook’s hegemony, Mr. Hughes says, is Mr. Zuckerberg’s “unilateral control over speech.” He points as an example to Mr. Zuckerberg’s 2017 decision to stop Facebook Messenger from being used in Myanmar to spread calls for the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. At the same time, United Nations investigators and human rights groups said that the company didn’t do nearly enough and, in its negligence, actively facilitated what has since been deemed a genocide.

“Mark knows that this is too much power,” Mr. Hughes writes.

Breaking up Facebook isn’t a silver bullet

Breaking up Facebook isn’t enough, as even Mr. Hughes admits, since it won’t address some of society’s greatest grievances with the platform, argues Evelyn Douek in Slate. On the issue of election security, she writes:

If we’re worried about Russia or other foreign powers using Facebook and other social media platforms to influence elections — as Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentions when making her case for breakup — then we also need to acknowledge that these influence campaigns are often sophisticated, cross-platform operations that require well-resourced, expert and coordinated responses. No one has made a good case for how breakup and competition would aid these efforts.

Ms. Douek also agrees with Mr. Hughes that Mr. Zuckerberg’s control over speech is deeply troubling. But she fails to see how increased competition would have helped in Myanmar, where the military purposefully spread violent propaganda. Authoritarianism and ethnic hatred are not problems the market can solve, nor are “the most intractable issues about how to moderate speech on any individual platform.”

User privacy, Shira Ovide argues in Bloomberg, is another issue that breaking apart the Facebook platform from Instagram and WhatsApp wouldn’t fix. She writes:

Does a core Facebook with perhaps 1 billion users have less ability to harvest information such as people’s web-surfing habits and physical locations as they roam around with smartphones? No, it doesn’t.

Both Ms. Douek and Ms. Ovide are open to breaking up Facebook to keep markets competitive, but they see trustbusting as somewhat beside the point of regulation and democratic oversight. They share this perspective with the tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has called in The Times for a national privacy law as well as increased funding for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector.

Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, goes one step further, claiming that Facebook should be treated as a public utility, like water and electric companies. He writes in the Harvard Business Review, “Facebook and firms like it have become natural monopolies that necessitate a novel, stringent set of regulations to obstruct their capitalistic overreaches and protect the public against ingrained economic exploitation.”

Facebook is being vilified

Reports of Facebook’s monopoly are exaggerated, writes Bloomberg’s editorial board. Dominance in a market, it says, should not be mistaken for a lack of competition:

As successful as Facebook is, there’s little stopping other companies from doing things better. In fact, they already are: Nearly all of Facebook’s constituent services — messaging, video sharing and so forth — face competition from apps around the world.

Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has argued that the company faces a great deal of competition from Chinese tech companies, which would benefit from a policy like Ms. Warren’s. “You could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don’t address the underlying issues people are concerned about,” she said in May.

What’s more, writes CNBC’s Matt Rosoff, calls to break up Facebook or regulate it like a public utility ignore the fact that it isn’t strictly necessary to modern life as water and electricity are:

Hughes and others have cited historical precedents such as the government’s breakup of Standard Oil and AT&T as a justification for stricter antitrust regulation against tech giants. But these companies not only had clear monopolies with pricing power that hurt consumers, they also offered products that were vital to the economy. … Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are only three of many ways people can communicate digitally, and while many people spend hours every week using them, they are replaceable and inessential.

In the end, writes Jim Geraghty for National Review, the fault is not in our tech overlords, but in ourselves:"

And yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I’m looking at you.”

For Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say.

“Facebook believes political speech should be protected,” a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. “If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.”

Truth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook’s political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University.

Presidential candidates have been spending huge sums on ads on Facebook and other social media platforms to reach voters. Some campaigns have focused on advertising specifically on Facebook given its sheer size — it has more than 2.2 billion users worldwide — and the ability to spread ads and content cheaply and quickly across the platform."

The current controversy stems from two separate but related events. The first revolves around leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg speaking privately to employees at recent town hall meetings, where he called Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plans to break up Facebook an “existential” threat to the company and one he would fight. The second is a recent announcement by Facebook that it is exempting political figures from its policy forbidding spreading misinformation in advertisements (yes, politicians spreading false claims in their ads is just a part of the political conversation, according to Facebook).

Both developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook “intends to use their influence in this election” and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network’s ad policy “is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.” At the same time, old fears that the company’s “I Voted” button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.

But Ms. Warren’s concerns miss a key point about the social network’s roles in elections.

Yes, Facebook’s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform’s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook’s essential threat to democracy isn’t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate — it’s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate — and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.

Few politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He’s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like “The Wall,” eventually do become policy). Almost every iteration of his messaging is the type of polarizing content that is candy for Facebook’s algorithms."

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Eighty percent of white workers said their managers were white, while 38 percent of nonwhite workers had a manager of the same race. The results were based on a subset of 20,400 survey respondents from 81 of the nation’s largest retail and food service companies.

The researchers used a novel technique to find survey takers: They placed ads on Facebook. The full sample is of workers at 120 of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States, industries that employ one-fifth of American workers. It is not a random sample, but they said it is reflective of the retail and food service work force. It is much larger than any other survey of this group of workers and provides more fine-grained data. Social scientists not involved in the research said it was carefully done and convincing.

Two-thirds of workers said they received less than two weeks’ notice of their schedules, and 15 percent had less than 72 hours of notice. Eighty percent said they had little or no input into their schedules. A third said they wanted more hours than they were assigned.

Not knowing when they will work worsens the challenges of people living on a low income, the survey found.

Over all, hourly workers described going hungry, not being able to pay bills, scrambling to arrange child care, losing housing, losing sleep and feeling stressed and unhealthy. But those with unpredictable schedules were twice as likely to report hardships as those with stable schedules — even when they earned the same wages, worked the same number of hours and had the same employers.

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden’s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny “Joe 2020” pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden’s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private.

Multiple attendees said Ms. Warren was, by far, Mr. Biden’s most discussed opponent, with his strategists telling donors they expected her to come under new press scrutiny now that she has risen in the polls."

She has breached 20 percent of the vote in recent national surveys and might hold a narrow lead in Iowa and New Hampshire. The prediction markets now consider her a clear favorite to win the nomination. It can be hard to see how her Democratic rivals will attack or stop her.

But the challenge facing Ms. Warren, if past primaries are any indication, isn’t those rivals. It is whether she will hit a wall: the rank and file of the Democratic primary electorate.

In primary after primary, the candidates of the party’s left-liberal activists have failed to win the more typical members of the Democratic Party. These voters don’t show up at rallies or post on political Twitter. They are more moderate. They are disproportionately nonwhite; Southern; and less likely to have graduated from college. But in the modern era, they have usually had the votes to decide the nomination. In August, t hey even had the votes to sway an Iowa straw poll to Joe Biden when other candidates attracted far bigger crowds at the same fai r.

To win the nomination, Ms. Warren will need to advance beyond her factional base to a broader coalition. Historically, many left-liberal candidates have found it easy to attract 20-plus percent in the polls and five-digit crowds on the stump. Howard Dean (2004) and Bernie Sanders (2016) had done so by this point in the election cycle. But such candidates have found it far harder to win."

The big talking points from last night

Candidates were pressed on a number of issues at last night’s Democratic presidential debate. But the standout moments involved topics close to the business community.

On health care:

• Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has moved to the top of some polls, faced more criticism about her universal health care proposal than she has in the past.

• Mayor Pete Buttigieg told Ms. Warren he didn’t understand “why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans.”"

“A yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.” He rattled off how her plan would “obliterate” the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his “Medicare for all who want it” alternative.

Mr. Buttigieg’s rebuke of Mr. O’Rourke — “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” — may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren.

But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years.

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

“He’s not as sharp as he might be,” said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. “He’s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He’s probably not my first choice.”"

At Wednesday night’s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters.

“A lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump,” he said. “I agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.”

Mr. Biden’s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump’s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly — despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim."

He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son’s work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: “Let’s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he’s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!” The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode.

For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden’s family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau’s death from brain cancer.

Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign. Mr. Mowrer said he saw the elder Mr. Biden in Iowa last month and they discussed not Hunter but his other son, Beau.

“Beau’s death is very, very fresh in his mind, and so now these attacks on Hunter are even more unsettling,” Mr. Mowrer said.

A big bet on South Carolina

The politics of Ukraine and impeachment have been so costly for Mr. Biden, in part, because he is confronting so many other challenges in the Democratic race : a struggle to excite liberal primary voters, an ascendant rival in Ms. Warren and a decline in fund-raising that has forced him to spend even more time appealing to donors in cities hundreds of miles from the early primary states.

Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, acknowledged some of those problems in a briefing for Democratic donors at Morgan Stanley’s New York office last month. Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina — the fourth primary state — and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March."

Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

The targeted audience for this Biden ad on Medicare was overwhelmingly women 65 or older. Source: Facebook

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

An ad about Julian Castro’s pet euthanasia policy was shown mostly to women. Source: Facebook

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

An ad with Ms. Gabbard describing her foreign policy while standing in front of an American flag was disproportionately shown to men. Source: Facebook

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

AD

They both support what would be a massive economic restructuring with ideas such as Medicare-for-all, but Sanders, 78, has carved out his brand as a democratic socialist while Warren, 70, has described herself as a capitalist who has operated more as part of the Democratic mainstream. While Sanders drew notice in 2016 for his avid fans and big crowds, it is Warren this time who is gaining traction that way.

AD

These challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders’s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign quietly fired its Iowa political director in the late summer and has yet to name a replacement — a key vacancy as the race enters a crucial phase, with less than five months to go before the February caucuses.

Sanders’s difficulties in Iowa have come into sharper focus over the weekend. The most respected pollster in the state released a survey late Saturday showing Warren surging to 22 percent, two points ahead of former vice president Joe Biden, with Sanders at 11 percent. That places him third in the state where he fought Hillary Clinton to a near draw in 2016, launching an electrifying national movement.

AD

Perhaps more worrisome for Sanders, the poll provided the clearest indication yet that Warren is eating into his base. She is winning a bigger share of people who caucused for Sanders in 2016 than he is, and she is outpacing him among those under 35, his former strong suit, according to the survey conducted by Selzer and Co. for the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom.

AD

“I give him tremendous credit for changing the conversation,” said Rod Sullivan, a Johnson County supervisor who introduced Sanders at a campaign stop in 2015 and now backs Warren. “We need to get that kind of stuff done and I think there’s a better way to get it done now. Last time was a binary choice and this time I think there are better messengers.”

Sanders campaign officials, dismissing the notion that their candidate is struggling, vowed Sunday to plow ahead with aggressive moves to win the Iowa caucuses. The Sanders campaign announced last week it has attracted 1 million individual donors, a historic mark that officials said is a strong sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy.

AD

“Unlike Bernie Sanders, polls are inconsistent and all over the place, including an Iowa poll that came a few days ago,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. “We feel good about our field operation in the state and our team is working harder and harder each day to urge people to caucus for a once-in-a-lifetime candidate.”

AD

Sanders will embark Monday on a “Bernie Beats Trump” tour across the state, an effort to argue that he is the most electable choice against President Trump in 2020. But his more immediate obstacle is Warren, whom he has refrained from criticizing, though some of his surrogates have been more aggressive.

Sanders has sought to stand out from the pack by emphasizing his decades-long advocacy of sweeping ideas such as Medicare-for-all, something he did at a Sunday rally in Warren’s childhood hometown of Norman, Okla.

AD

“It is unique and maybe unique in American history,” Sanders said of his campaign, as he encouraged supporters to join a nationwide grass-roots movement. After they started chanting his name, he replied, “It ain’t Bernie, it’s you.”

For loyal followers such as C.J. Petersen of Breda, Iowa, Sanders’s consistency merits support at the caucuses. “Senator Warren is fantastic,” the 29-year-old said. “But Bernie has been on these issues in the very beginning.”

AD

But for many others, that’s no longer enough. Matt Shockley, a 24-year-old teacher from Oklahoma City who attended the Sanders rally in Norman, said he voted for Sanders in 2016, but now is leaning toward Warren.

AD

“She’s very warm as a person and she has her own kind of charisma,” he said. “I think that will really help in the general. And on policy, she and Bernie are so similar, it doesn’t feel like there’s much of a trade-off in voting for her over him.”

As the Sanders campaign tries to hang on to voters like Shockley, employee disputes and staff shake-ups have jolted the senator’s organization, stretching from important early states to the Washington headquarters, leading to firings, resignations, tense meetings and fierce rivalries, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

In New Hampshire, where Sanders defeated Clinton by 22 points but is now in close competition with Warren and Biden, Sanders recently changed state directors. The operation had been tumultuous for months, people with knowledge with the situation said.

AD

AD

Some of the internal friction has touched the highest levels of the campaign. A dispute over salaries earlier this year pitted rank-and-file field staff against campaign management. On a conference call the day after a Washington Post report about the standoff, Shakir bluntly warned any leakers to quickly leave the campaign, speaking in a tone that angered some participants, people with knowledge of the call said.

The Post interviewed 30 present and past Sanders aides, allies and voters for this report. Many who described the tension in the campaign spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.

Warren has been building a robust operation in Iowa that many local Democratic strategists said is the most impressive in the field. She has been picking off former Sanders backers, including some of his earliest champions.

AD

AD

The Sanders campaign brushed aside questions about firing its Iowa political director, Jess Mazour, in the late summer. “We’ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,” Shakir said in a written statement after The Post contacted the campaign last week. Mazour did not respond to requests for comment.

Although friction and turnover are not uncommon in the high-pressure environment of presidential campaigns, the extent of the discord in the Sanders operation has surprised some Democrats inside and outside the campaign. They say it reflects a departure from Sanders’s 2016 effort.

“As presidential campaigns go, the 2016 Sanders campaign had less conflict than most,” said Mark Longabaugh, a lead strategist on that run who abruptly parted ways with the campaign on the eve of Sanders’s entrance into the 2020 race.

Sanders campaign officials played down the personnel changes and said his unique platform of demanding revolutionary change will ultimately propel him to victory.

“Senator Sanders is very confident. He is feeling good about the campaign. We believe this race is down to the three people and we have the best ground game,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of Sanders’s national co-chairs.

Khanna was speaking about Warren and Biden, who along with Sanders, have appeared at the top of most recent state and national surveys.

Inside the Sanders campaign in New Hampshire, there were issues at the top levels of the campaign from its earliest days. State director Joe Caiazzo and senior strategist Kurt Ehrenberg, two veterans of the 2016 campaign, were in constant conflict, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

AD

The workplace situation became so strained earlier this year that a human resources official had to intervene, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

Caiazzo and Ehrenberg declined to comment for this story. Caiazzo was recently reassigned to run the Sanders campaign in Massachusetts and Ehrenberg is no longer with the campaign.

Shakir said the personnel decisions were of no concern. “We’ve built a great team in New Hampshire and are in a really strong position there,” Shakir said in a statement explaining the moves.

Yet for some Sanders supporters, the New Hampshire Democratic convention earlier this month served as a sobering moment. In a state where Sanders won just over 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 primary, he was no longer the top draw.

Sanders took the stage in Manchester to a rousing ovation, to as many full chairs as anyone then had earned, and to a room of waving signs bearing his name. It was louder than the reception greeting for anyone else — until Warren took the stage to a two-minute ovation not long after."

Senator Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Joe Biden in Iowa for the first time in the state’s most influential poll. The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, released Saturday night, found that 22 percent of registered Democrats now say that Warren is their first choice among the Democratic presidential candidates, giving her a two-point lead over Biden and an 11-point lead over fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, whose first-choice support has fallen to just 11 percent of respondents. Though the results have a four-point margin of error, the gold-standard Register poll has consistently shown that Warren, with her impressive Iowa field organization, has continued to gain support in the state, particularly as other candidates in the wide Democratic field have lost luster among voters.

Indeed, perhaps the best news for Warren in the poll, other than the new and narrow lead, is that 71 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers are now either supporting her or considering it — including the 22 percent who say she’s their first choice, another 20 percent who say she is their second choice, and 29 percent who say they are actively considering her as their potential pick. In addition, 75 percent of respondents viewed Warren favorably, besting South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg (69 percent) and Biden (66 percent).

Meanwhile, 60 percent of Iowa Democrats said they were considering Biden — though there is more confidence among his first-choice supporters than any others, with 26 percent saying they’ll definitely vote for the former vice-president, compared with just 12 percent of Warren supporters saying the same about her. 88 percent of Warren’s first-choicers said they were open to changing their minds, as did 70 percent of Biden backers. Overall, just one in five would-be caucus-goers said they had made up their mind with less than five months to go before the Iowa caucuses on February 3.

This is one of my favorite ways we’ve broken down the race – it tries to include the entire universe of people considering these candidates.

Widely respected Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer emphasized the current flexibility of Iowans’ support in her analysis of the results, telling the Register that while the poll was the “first major shakeup” of the race, she still saw “opportunity aplenty” for candidates to shake things up again. “The leaders aren’t all that strong,” she commented on Saturday. “The universe is not locked in.”

That being said, Bernie Sanders has been consistently losing support in Iowa, according to the Register’s polling, as some of his most important constituencies have shifted to Warren. Per the new poll, nearly a third of the Iowans who caucused for Sanders in 2016 now plan to caucus for Warren instead, while only a quarter say they’ll repeat for Bernie. She leads among voters under 35, 27 percent of whom now consider Warren their first choice, to Sanders’s 22 percent (and Biden’s 9 percent.) Warren’s support among the very liberal is even higher, with 48 percent now backing her, versus only 20 percent for Sanders.

As expected, Biden continues to command the most support from older Democrats, attracting 35 percent of likely caucus-goers 65 and older — a nearly three-to-one lead over Warren among that demographic. And it’s not clear how Warren’s campaign for “big structural change” will sound to them or to the 59 percent of Iowa Democrats who expect the U.S. government to return to normal when the norm-demolishing Trump is out of the White House.

Only 28 percent of respondents said they were “extremely enthusiastic” about their current first-choice candidates, but note the gap at the top: 32 percent of Warren supporters were extremely enthusiastic about her, compared to 22 percent of Biden supporters, which is down from 29 percent in the June edition of the Register poll. (Looking at Biden’s not-great favorability trends, Selzer speculated that “he’s not wearing well” in the state.)

Lastly, Iowans were asked to weigh in a some electability factors as well. The ability to beat Trump was the most important candidate criteria for 63 percent of respondents, while 31 percent favored likemindedness on issues. As to what makes a candidate more electable, 74 percent said that the ability to excite and turn out out new voters mattered more than turning out the base (which was favored by 16 percent); 63 percent said positions which found common group with the GOP mattered more than leftward-moving ones (which was favored by 28 percent); 57 percent thought representing a new generation of leadership mattered more than a long record of government service (which was favored by 28 percent); and 54 percent of Democrats thought taking “the high road” against Trump was also important. (The muddy road was more important for 35 percent.)"

Most of the buzz surrounding the release over the weekend of the latest gold-standard Iowa poll from Ann Selzer (for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom) involved the candidates who have long been at the top of the heap. In particular, Selzer showed Elizabeth Warren (22 percent) moving ahead of Joe Biden (20 percent), and having double the level of support as third-place Bernie Sanders (11 percent). No other candidate was in double figures, and fourth-placed Pete Buttigieg (9 percent) lost six points since the last Iowa poll in June. So the bottom line was continued churn among the Big Three, with Warren showing the most momentum, but with not much shaking lower on the long list of candidates.

But Selzer also compiled favorable/unfavorable ratios for the candidates, and a look at them may help to discern which of today’s bottom-feeders have true dark horse potential, and which are probably going nowhere fast. Nine active candidates have positive net favorability numbers among likely caucus-goers:

Warren +58 Buttigieg +56 Harris +39 Booker +38 Biden +37 Klobuchar +30 O’Rourke +28 Sanders +22 Yang +6

But nine others are underwater:

Castro -1 Bennet -3 Bullock -5 Gabbard -5 Steyer -5 Sestak -14 Ryan -15 Delaney -17 Williamson -39

Two of the candidates with net negative favorability ratings (Castro and Steyer) have qualified for the October debates, and one other (Gabbard) is one qualifying poll away from making the stage with eight days left before the deadline.

Yes, this is just one poll from one state, albeit a highly regarded poll from the single-most important state, but it provides some evidence that below the Big Three are five who are making enough of a positive impression on Iowa Democrats that a late surge isn’t at all out of the question. And actually, all of the those five have higher net favorability numbers than Bernie Sanders, which increases the bad news he got from Selzer.

Not many pollsters offer favorability/unfavorability ratings for the entire field, but one national tracking poll that does, Morning Consult, offers a somewhat different take, from findings collected just after the September debate. It shows only one candidate, Marianne Williamson, having an underwater favorability ratio (-6). Here’s the rest of the field (Morning Consult didn’t bother to poll Joe Sestak):

Sanders +59 Biden +54 Warren +52 Harris +38 Buttigieg +33 O’Rourke +31 Booker +30 Yang +22 Klobuchar +21 Castro +11 Gabbard +11 Steyer +8 Bennet +6 Bullock +6 Delaney +3 Ryan +1

The rankings are pretty similar, with the exception of a big difference of opinion over Bernie Sanders (the most popular candidate nationally, per MC, but only the eighth most popular in Iowa, per Selzer), and some less dramatic divergences over candidates in the middle of the pack like Yang and Klobuchar (much more popular, unsurprisingly, in next-door Iowa).

At this point you’d have to figure October-debate non-qualifiers Bennet, Bullock, Delaney, Ryan, and Sestak are pretty toasty, with possible qualifier Gabbard and qualifiers Castro and Steyer not looking so hot, either. Yang’s on the bubble, as is Klobuchar, though her relative strength in Iowa could keep her aloft. But if you’re looking for a dark horse at this point, it’s probably going to be from the group that includes Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, and O’Rourke. So in your mental road-map of the race you should probably add a Little Four to the Big Three. And if Cory Booker’s campaign isn’t bluffing in its recent distress signal about fundraising, the list of plausible dark horses could soon shrink further."

So why do they keep cranking up the Boss?

AD

AD

Because Springsteen embodies white working-class Rust Belt voters who, until recently, constituted a core Democratic voting bloc.

In Springsteen, Democrats see an archetype of the white working class, one who can help them woo the voters in the Rust Belt and farm states who have turned various shades of Republican red over the past half-century. However, winning the white working-class vote requires more than Springsteen songs. It requires running on a platform of worker-focused economic populism that would address the policy concerns embedded in his lyrics.

Raised in Freehold, N.J., Springsteen had a decidedly working-class upbringing. His mother worked as a legal secretary, often providing the family’s sole source of income as his father — who struggled with mental illness and alcoholism — bounced between blue-collar jobs.

AD

AD

Springsteen himself never worked in a factory. Instead, he threw himself into music that reflected his background. Springsteen’s breakthrough 1975 album, “Born to Run,” is about young people yearning to escape, kids who “work all day to blow ‘em away in the night” (“Night”). The rocker’s next four albums focused on characters who never got out of their factory towns. On “Darkness on the Edge of Town” (1978) and “The River” (1980), Springsteen’s characters found themselves trapped by familial responsibility in deadening jobs. Instead of driving off into the sunset, they were left working all day in their father’s garage, “driving all night chasing some mirage” and longing for the day they could “blow away the dreams” that break their hearts (“The Promised Land”).

On the acoustic “Nebraska” (1982) and the misunderstood “Born in the U.S.A.” (1984), which launched Springsteen into international superstardom, the singer progressed from examining characters facing personal disappointment to those victimized by an economic system rigged against them. Through no fault of their own, his characters are laid off from textile mills (“My Hometown”), lumber yards (“Downbound Train”) and oil refineries (“Born in the U.S.A.”) and are unable to find work, often leading to desperate, criminal acts, as on “Johnny 99” and “Atlantic City.” While his characters of the ’70s sought emotional satisfaction, Springsteen’s characters of the ’80s sought survival by any means necessary.

Springsteen’s songs mirrored the experience of many blue-collar workers in the 1970s and 1980s. After steadily increasing for almost three decades, blue-collar wages began to fall in 1973, and inflation began eating a larger share of workers’ paychecks. Meanwhile, rising oil prices sped factory flight, as companies deserted unionized Rust Belt states for the less regulated confines of the South or, increasingly, other countries. Especially in former manufacturing centers, unemployment and despair grew.

AD

AD

These economic changes quickened a long-simmering transformation in the politics of white working-class voters. Since the 1930s, union members in the Rust Belt had been one of the backbones of the Democratic Party’s New Deal Coalition, a broad tent of voters that also included urban African Americans and white Southerners. The coalition gave Democrats majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate for all but four years between 1933 and 1981.

The coalition began to fracture in the late 1960s and 1970s. White Rust Belt workers began to shift their political allegiances based on issues such as welfare, busing to desegregate public schools and opposition to the counterculture. The transition was completed when these voters became the “Reagan Democrats” who helped propel Ronald Reagan to the White House in 1980. Even if many workers felt betrayed by Reagan’s pro-business agenda, cultural issues had turned a solid flank of the Democratic Party into loyal Republicans.

For their part, Democrats largely forfeited these voters in favor of a new constituency: liberal suburban professionals, many of whom paired free-market proclivities with liberal cultural positions. Democratic presidential nominees such as Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton envisioned their core supporters not in unions halls and factories, but in universities and office buildings. Bill Clinton and Obama espoused populist economic messages that helped recapture some of the lost voters, but the geographic and cultural center of the party had definitively shifted.

AD

AD

As the real-life versions of his characters turned into Republicans, Springsteen did not. The singer came to understand that it was not government, but profit-hungry corporations that were responsible for everyday people’s struggles to make a decent living and for the devastation inflicted on communities when good-paying jobs disappeared.

And yet, Springsteen stayed out of the partisan fray. He called Reagan’s victory in 1980 “pretty frightening” and shrugged off an attempt by Reagan to co-opt his music in 1984. As he told Rolling Stone in 1987: “I never considered myself a particularly political person. I wasn’t when I was younger, and I don’t think I really am now.”

That changed in 2004, thanks to the second Iraq War. Long wracked with guilt about purposefully failing his draft examination during the Vietnam War, Springsteen could not stomach another unjustified foreign intervention. In 2004, he headlined the Vote for Change tour to raise money for Democratic electoral efforts. For each presidential election cycle since, he has hit the campaign trail to rouse Democratic rally audiences.

AD

AD

To Democrats, Springsteen is not just another celebrity endorser. While foreign policy may have politicized him personally, his songs from the past 40 years address the economic frustration that helped fuel the exodus of the white working class from the Democratic coalition. By having Springsteen at their campaign events and by playing his music at their rallies, Democrats signal that their tent is still big enough to include the white working class.

But music — even music as powerful and as popular as Springsteen’s — cannot serve as a substitute for policy, particularly the pro-worker, economic populism that made the white working class solidly Democratic in the 1930s. To overcome these voters’ conservative cultural inclinations, Democrats need proposals to address the effects of deindustrialization, to stop corporate attacks on labor unions and to increase workers’ wages.

To help bring these voters back into the Democratic fold, candidates should focus less on what Springsteen himself represents and focus instead on the meaning of his music. If they want to win the Rust Belt, Democrats’ message should reflect Springsteen’s one-line introduction to “Born to Run” on his 1984 tour, a simple idea that encapsulates the economic ideals at the heart of his politics: “Nobody wins, unless everybody wins.”

Never before have I seen Democratic candidates do so much to woo workers and win over union leaders. Elizabeth Warren kicked off her campaign at the site of the famous 1912 Bread and Roses textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Julián Castro marched in Durham, North Carolina, with fast-food workers demanding a $15 wage, while Pete Buttigieg spoke outside Uber headquarters in San Francisco alongside drivers demanding to be considered employees. Joe Biden held his first official campaign event at a Teamsters union hall in Pittsburgh. Kamala Harris has called for a raise averaging $13,500 for the nation’s schoolteachers, while Bernie Sanders has bolstered labor’s cause by using his email lists to urge supporters to join union picket lines.

Why all this sudden attention and affection for workers and unions — far more than I’ve ever seen during my nearly 25 years of writing about labor? Part of it is that this year’s Democratic candidates are doing what any smart politician would do when the field is so large — court one of the party’s largest constituencies, i.e., unions and their members. Part of it is that the candidates see that something is seriously broken in our economy: that income inequality, corporate profits, and the stock market have all been soaring while wages have largely stagnated for decades. Also, Democrats realize that a big reason Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 was that she didn’t show enough love to labor. The field seems to recognize that if a Democrat is going to win the presidency in 2020, the surest route is to win back the three longtime union strongholds — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that were key to Donald Trump’s victory. So the candidates have loosed a flood of pro-worker ideas, not just to make it easier to unionize, but to extend paid sick days and family leave to all workers, provide protections to pregnant workers, and safeguard LGBTQ+ Americans from discrimination on the job.

Four of them — Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rouke, Pete Buttigieg, and Cory Booker — have put forward remarkably detailed platforms of pro-worker and pro-union proposals, while Elizabeth Warren’s elaborate plan on trade goes far beyond what many union leaders have called for. Andrew Yang says his universal basic income will be a boon for workers, providing a lifeline to those who lose their jobs because of artificial intelligence and robots. Biden has been vague so far on labor matters, calling himself a union man and saying he supports a $15 minimum. Booker has introduced a fairly radical bill, the Worker Dividend Act, which would require corporations that do stock buybacks to pay out to their employees a sizable chunk of the money going to the buyback.

Considering how many candidates there are and how many proposals and speeches they’ve made, it’s hard to keep track of who stands for what — and which plans are substantively the most pro-labor. Below, I give grades to the Democratic front-runners, based not just on the positions they’ve espoused during the campaign, but also on their track records. (Some candidates seem to have discovered the cause of workers only after announcing that they were running for the presidency.)

I confess to one bias in grading the candidates. In my new book, Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor, I write that union power and worker power in the U.S. have fallen to their weakest point since World War II, and that this has fueled wage stagnation, out-of-control income inequality and a warped political system in which corporations and billionaire donors have far too much sway and workers far too little. In grading, I give extra points to candidates who are pushing or proposing strategies to fix this systemic problem and give American workers more power — in the workplace, in politics, and in policymaking.

Some will complain that the grades I give are too high, but it is important to remember that when it comes to worker issues, every Democratic candidate is head and shoulders above almost every Republican lawmaker. Republicans overwhelmingly oppose a higher minimum wage and basic protections like paid sick days, seeming to dread displeasing corporate donors and lobbyists. Most Republicans favor weakening labor unions, not strengthening them. Moreover, the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation, has given the Democratic candidates’ high scores for their career legislative records: Cory Booker (100), Kamala Harris (100), Bernie Sanders (98), Elizabeth Warren (98), Julian Castro (96), Amy Klobuchar (95), Beto O’Rourke (94). Of the candidates, Joe Biden has the lowest AFL-CIO score (86), based on when he left the Senate in 2009. Some labor experts say that in the highly polarized Congress, in which Republicans are often seeking to undermine unions, it’s not hard for Democrats to garner high AFL-CIO ratings. Still, this year’s progressive crop of candidates supports many bills that would go far to help union and workers, like the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would make it easier to unionize, and the Healthy Families Act, which would require most companies to provide full-time workers with seven paid sick days a year.

A

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has fought for workers ever since he entered Congress in 1991, introducing the Workplace Democracy Act in 1992, and reintroducing it in every Congress since. That bill would make it easier for workers to unionize by, among other things, giving them a right to do so as soon as a majority of workers sign pro-union cards rather than through a lengthy election process that strongly favors employers.

Sanders didn’t suddenly start joining union picket lines this year. In 2015, he marched alongside Verizon workers as well as workers picketing outside their potato-starch factory in Cedar Rapids. Sanders told those workers in Iowa, “We are sick and tired of the war against working families.” In this election cycle, Sanders has already won the endorsement of the United Electrical Workers, a small union with 35,000 members.

The labor platform that Sanders has announced this year envisions doubling union membership in four years. It is a dream list for the nation’s unions. Sanders wants to strengthen workers’ clout through legislation that promotes industry-wide bargaining (instead of employer-by-employer bargaining). He would prohibit awarding federal contracts to companies that pay less than $15 an hour; he would also ban right-to-work laws, allow all government employees to unionize, and prohibit employers from permanently replacing workers who go on strike. In perhaps his most radical proposal, Sanders calls for ending America’s at-will employment system — he would prohibit employers from firing workers except for “just cause.”

Sanders’s platform for a Green New Deal has helped lead the way in reassuring unions upset with climate-change activists; he has called for a “just transition” for fossil-fuel workers who lose their jobs if and when the nation shutters coal-fired power plants and takes other actions to slow global warming. Sanders would guarantee those workers five years of current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pensions support, and “priority job replacement for any displaced worker.”

Sanders has loudly opposed free-trade agreements. His repeated calls for Medicare for All have cheered many workers and some labor leaders, even as Joe Biden has attacked Medicare for All, saying it would take away the excellent health coverage won by many unions.

Sanders’s supporters argue that he has long been the most pro-labor of the candidates, but others point out that for all his pro-worker rhetoric, he has racked up few concrete victories for workers. Sanders counters that he has led the way on, for example, legislation protecting IBM workers’ pensions and doubling home-heating assistance to help low-income workers. Sanders has been Congress’ most outspoken champion of a $15 minimum wage, and is often given credit for helping persuade Jeff Bezos to boost the base wage at Amazon to that level.

A

Elizabeth Warren

Warren doesn’t have a pro-labor record stretching back decades, but she has been a remarkable fount of innovative, pro-worker ideas. Some union officials told me that her proposal on trade was by far the best and most sophisticated they’ve ever seen from a lawmaker. Criticizing the U.S. for long pursuing “a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of American workers,” Warren has proposed using trade agreements as a tool “to force other countries to raise the bar on everything from labor and environmental standards to anti-corruption rules.” Asserting that corporate lobbyists have long whispered into the ears of our trade negotiators, Warren has called for a far more transparent process and proposed that worker, environmental, and consumer representatives sit on committees that advise America’s trade negotiators.

Warren’s “Plan for Economic Patriotism” is far more thoughtful than anything Trump has developed to encourage and bring back manufacturing jobs. She calls for leveraging federal R&D to spur investment and job creation, noting that Apple has used technologies developed through federally sponsored R&D to produce tens of millions of iPhones overseas. To aid depressed communities, Warren says, “R&D investments should be spread across every region of the country, not focused on only a few coastal cities.” To boost the job prospects of young Americans who don’t go to college, she has proposed a tenfold increase — a total of $20 billion over ten years — for apprenticeship programs.

In a daring proposal, Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act would give labor far more voice in the economy by letting workers elect 40 percent of the board members of large American corporations. Her path-breaking work to create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been a boon to working families, helping prevent banks from imposing extortionate fees and helping keep payday lenders from preying on down-on-their-luck workers.

As Blue Compass, a political and opposition research firm, makes clear, week after week Warren has done far more on social media than other candidates to go to bat for unions, for instance, doing videos on behalf of Las Vegas hotel workers seeking a contract. Amid concerns that Medicare for All might hurt some union members, Warren has pledged to include labor leaders in all Medicare for All discussions. “Strengthening America’s labor unions will be a central goal of my administration,” Warren told In These Times. She recently won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, which had endorsed Sanders in 2016.

Last Monday, at her rally in Washington Square that attracted 20,000 New Yorkers, Warren spoke movingly and at length about the 1911 Triangle Fire, about the 146 Triangle workers who died, and about the brilliant efforts, led by Frances Perkins, who later served as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Labor, to prevent more such factory disasters — and to improve conditions overall for America’s workers.

Pete Buttigieg

Mayor Pete’s platform on labor, A New Rising Tide, is one of the very best things I’ve read from any modern-day politician on worker issues. He sees much injustice in the workplace: that Uber misclassifies workers as independent contractors to deny them basic worker protections, that the McDonald’s franchising model undermines workers’ ability to unionize, that Google hires so many temps and independent contractors to undermine workers’ bargaining power. “The hard truth is that while the economy changed, workers’ voices” have been “systematically silenced,” Buttigieg writes. “Our economy has been tilted towards the wealthy and away from the middle and working class because the people in power designed our laws and policies that way.”

Buttigieg’s platform would raise the federal minimum wage to $15, end right-to-work laws, give workers the power to unionize through card check, guarantee paid sick leave and family leave, ban the use of permanent replacement workers, and take strong steps to curb corporations’ often-intimidating sway over unionization elections.

Union officials in Indiana say that Buttigieg, though just 37, is not a Johnny-come-lately in supporting labor. He sided with labor unions when Indiana Republicans sought to repeal the state’s “common construction wage law,” which helped assure higher wages for construction workers. Buttigieg also signed a labor-backed “responsible bidding” ordinance that requires businesses seeking city contracts with South Bend to disclose OSHA violations.

“He’s been fantastic,” Jim Gardner, an official with the Operating Engineers union told In These Times. Buttigieg’s unsuccessful campaign for state treasurer in 2010 was run out of the offices of South Bend’s building trades unions.

Joe Biden

Biden was the first candidate to secure a union endorsement, receiving it from the 320,000-member International Association of Fire Fighters. Its longtime president, Harold Schaitberger, lavished praise on his friend, saying, “He’s one of the staunchest advocates for working families. He knows that a strong middle class means a strong America.”

Nonetheless, Biden faces many questions from unions. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and while President Obama was considered pro-union, he negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Biden supported that agreement, and many unions deride it to this day, even after Trump pulled out of the agreement.

At his campaign’s official kickoff event at a Teamsters hall, Biden trumpeted, “I make no apologies. I am a union man.” Some union leaders were nonetheless upset that on the day Biden announced his candidacy — three days before the Teamsters hall event — he spoke at a high-dollar Philadelphia fundraiser organized by a senior executive at Comcast. Patrick Eiding, the president of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, complained that the “first place he goes” is to a Comcast executive’s. “No connection with labor,” Eiding said. “It was a little disturbing.” One labor scholar, writing in May, said he could find only two instances when Biden appeared on a picket line, “once in Iowa, during his 1987 presidential campaign and just this month (May) in Boston,” backing the Stop and Shop supermarket strikers.

As a senator, Biden supported organized labor’s No. 1 priority, the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it easier to unionize by, among other things, giving unions a right to use card check. At a forum sponsored by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in August, Biden spoke robustly for labor, decrying “an all-out war on suppressing wages to increase profits.”

The labor platform that Biden has sketched out so far is short, indeed abbreviated. He supports a $15 minimum wage, curbing noncompete clauses, easing occupational licensing requirements, and making it easier for workers to unionize and bargain (without spelling out how). None of this is the fight-like-hell stuff one might expect from someone who characterizes himself as a champion of labor.

B

Cory Booker

Booker has pushed some daring, unorthodox ideas to help workers. One is the Worker Dividend Act, a Senate bill he sponsored that would help workers share in a company’s profits by requiring corporations that do stock buybacks to pay their employees either an amount equal to the lesser of the value of the buyback or half of all profits above $250 million. Booker has also proposed a job guarantee that would give 15 cities or rural areas federal money so they can guarantee jobs to everyone who wants one. Economists say this pilot measure would go far to help marginal, struggling workers.

Booker has a reputation for being close to Wall Street — he defended Bain Capital when Barack Obama attacked it during the 2012 campaign, and received $2.2 million from the securities and investment industry, more than any other senator, during the 2013 to 2014 election cycle. Nonetheless, his record on worker rights and unions is progressive — he backs a $15 minimum wage and bills that would make it easier to unionize, including Sanders’s Workplace Democracy Act and the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Last Wednesday, Booker beefed up his labor bona fides by releasing an elaborate platform called “Opportunity and Justice for Workers.” In it, Booker says, “For most people in this country, our economy is broken.” His platform calls for sweeping new laws to make it easier to unionize, raise workers’ wages, and ease work-life balance.

Teachers’ unions have long been uneasy with Booker because he championed vouchers and charter schools as Newark’s mayor. Labor leaders complain that these moves siphon money from traditional public schools and undermine teachers’ unions. The Newark Teachers Union opposed Booker’s 2010 reelection as mayor. But Booker argues that that teachers’ union often obstructed moves to improve educational quality in Newark’s struggling schools. At a union forum in August, Booker said he would prioritize public schools and noted that the New Jersey Education Association, his state’s largest teachers’ union, had endorsed him as a Senate candidate.

B

Julián Castro

Castro has been the most outspoken candidate on behalf of immigrants, but his platform has been thin on worker and labor issues. (Vox’s labor reporter wrote that Castro “probably has the weakest labor platform” on worker issues.) He met with striking University of California medical workers and attended a meeting of campus workers at Stanford, his alma mater, to show support before they began contract negotiations with the university. (California’s early primary is especially important for Castro’s prospects.) He has spoken at various union audiences, but he hasn’t made lifting up workers a central theme of his campaign. Castro backs numerous measures that would help working families, including universal child care, paid family leave, and a $15 minimum wage.

B

Kamala Harris

Unlike Sanders, Booker, Buttigieg, and O’Rourke, Kamala Harris has not adopted a plan that shouts to the world that she is eager to expand unions. She has taken a different, sometimes innovative course. She has trumpeted a plan that would lift the pay of the nation’s public school teachers by $13,500 on average, a move that has delighted two of the nation’s largest and most powerful unions: the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. In July, Harris introduced legislation for a National Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights, which would help the nation’s nannies, housekeepers and caregivers by giving them minimum wage and overtime protections and paid time off and requiring their employers to give them written employment contracts. To reduce income inequality, Harris has introduced a bill called LIFT the Middle Class Act that would give a refundable tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to households earning under $100,000 annually.

Harris uses social media to promote various union causes, such as organizing UCLA’s medical residents. But she has not made battling for unions and workers a signature part of her campaign the way Sanders and Warren have and has not issued a detailed labor platform.

B

Beto O’Rourke

O’Rourke’s labor platform, A 21st Century Labor Contract, is an impressive, thoughtful document. He calls for lifting workers collectively by expanding unions and their bargaining clout, while also calling for lifting workers individually, legislating new worker rights, by, for instance, guaranteeing seven paid sick days.

In his labor platform, O’Rourke proposes a nationwide law to let all government workers and farm workers unionize, and doing likewise for all frontline supervisors and independent contractors. (Letting frontline supervisors join unions would greatly expand union power, especially during strikes; letting independent contractors unionize and bargain would be a powerful tool for gig workers.) O’Rourke would adopt nationwide rules making it far easier for Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig workers to be considered employees — a move that would extend minimum wage and overtime coverage to them as well as protections against sexual harassment and race discrimination. O’Rourke would establish government-appointed wage boards that would set, and presumably improve, wages and conditions for industries with low union membership — for instance, fast-food restaurants, nail salons, carwashes.

Although from conservative Texas, O’Rourke has forcefully called for raising the minimum wage to $15 so workers don’t have to juggle two and three jobs. Some labor advocates point out, with chagrin, that when O’Rourke was on the El Paso City Council in 2010, he questioned whether police and firefighters should have a right to bargain collectively. At the time, El Paso faced a large budget deficit due to the recession, and city officials wanted municipal unions to agree to defer their raises. O’Rourke was angry that the police union continued to insist on wage increases that he said amounted to 8 percent. At one point, O’Rourke even asked the city’s attorney whether there was a way to eliminate the police union. In a 2011 interview, he said, “I do not think it is in the community’s best interests, certainly not in the taxpayers’ best interests, to have collective bargaining by the police and firefighters.”

But more recently, O’Rourke has championed the right of all public-sector workers, including police officers to unionize, telling a union meeting in Houston in July, “We’ve seen the devastation in our communities and in our states when unions are not allowed to organize … As president, I want to make sure that we guarantee the right to organize for every educator and public servant in every state.”

B-

Amy Klobuchar

Klobuchar has “one of the vaguest labor platforms” of the Democratic candidates, Vox wrote recently. She often tells audiences that she is the daughter of a unionized teacher and newspaperman and granddaughter of a unionized iron ore miner. She says that “as President she’ll stand up against attempts to weaken unions,” adding, without offering details, that she wants to reform labor laws, protect collective bargaining rights and roll back right-to-work laws. In her first 100 days as president, she says, she will issue executive orders requiring federal contractors to pay at least $15 an hour, scrapping Trump’s rollback of overtime protections, and banning companies from requiring low-wage workers to sign noncompete clauses.

Despite her impressive rhetorical and debating skills, Klobuchar is not much of a fighter for workers — her focus is usually elsewhere — and this from a lawmaker whose state has a famous farm-labor tradition and has sent several warriors for workers to the Senate, most recently Paul Wellstone. Some former Klobuchar aides have said she can be an abusive boss. Based on interviews with ex-staffers, The New York Times wrote that Klobuchar was “not just demanding but often dehumanizing” and “not merely a tough boss,” but “the steward of a work environment colored by volatility, highhandedness and distrust.” Considering this, that’s all the more reason Klobuchar should be working doubly hard to show she is a champion of workers.

C+

Andrew Yang

Yang talks as if his universal basic income program (which would guarantee $1,000 a month to every citizen over the age of 18) would be a boon for America’s workers. He says it would be a welcome supplement for low-wage and part-time workers and a lifeline to laid-off workers, helping them avoid misery and easing the pressure on them to take whatever job is offered them, no matter how low the pay. He says UBI would increase workers’ bargaining power “because a guaranteed, unconditional income gives them leverage to say no to exploitative wages and abusive working conditions” UBI would help workers who are on strike, Yang says, by enabling them to hold out longer and demand a better contract.

To my mind, Yang’s single issue — Yang calls it a “Freedom Dividend” — hardly begins to address, much less fix, the biggest problems American workers face: soaring income inequality and the overall decline of worker power. Some experts argue that UBI would encourage some employers to lower workers’ pay.

In a Labor Day blog post last year, Yang seemed to have only just discovered the importance of labor unions and collective worker action — he was marveling at the historic achievements of Walter Reuther, the UAW, and other unions, and how they played a pivotal role in building the world’s largest and richest middle class. In Yang’s platform, there is little acknowledgement of what collective action or unions have achieved and can achieve for American workers. (He inaccurately says union membership has dropped 70 percent from its peak; it’s dropped 30 percent.)

Many people I respect support UBI, especially to help the millions of workers who some predict will lose their jobs because of AI, robots, and other new technologies. I nonetheless wonder how will laid-off workers survive on $12,000 a year, especially when some supporters of UBI have called for weakening various parts of the social safety net. As far as I can tell, Yang — who is very eloquent in discussing the threat that new technologies pose to workers — has hardly discussed a key issue: the importance of giving workers (and not just corporate executives, technology gurus, and Silicon Valley investors) a voice in what new technologies will mean for workers and the economy. I fear that UBI, combined with technology-induced layoffs, will create an underclass of the long-term unemployed scraping by on $12,000 a year, and an overclass of very wealthy executives and investors who own and control the new technologies.

Donald Trump

Trump campaigned as a champion of workers, but his administration is unarguably the most anti-worker, anti-union administration since Ronald Reagan — and is arguably even more anti-worker. Trump and his appointees have taken dozens of actions to hurt workers. They have rolled back overtime protections extended to millions of workers and scrapped the “fiduciary rule” requiring Wall Street firms to act in workers’ best interests in handling 401k’s. His administration has reduced the number of OSHA inspectors and weakened safety requirements for oil-rig workers. Trump has made it easier to award federal contracts to corporations that have repeatedly violated minimum wage and overtime laws, race and sex discrimination laws, and laws protecting workers’ ability to unionize. His administration has hurt LGBTQ+ workers by urging the Supreme Court to rule that they are not covered by federal anti-discrimination laws.

Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, has long been corporate America’s top gun, its leading lawyer, in seeking to quash many new regulations protecting workers. Trump’s Supreme Court appointee, Neil Gorsuch, provided the pivotal vote in important cases that weakened public-sector unions and let corporations prohibit workers from bringing class actions, making it far harder for millions of Americans to vindicate their workplace rights. Trump’s appointees to the National Labor Relations Board have been extremely aggressive in seeking to weaken unions and obstruct union organizing – for instance, declaring that Uber and Lyft drivers shouldn’t be classified as employees, making it far harder to unionize franchises like McDonald’s, and vastly reducing the ability of contracted-out workers to picket employers.

The only reason Trump deserves an F-plus and not an F is that he had made good on one big promise to workers — his vow to fight on trade. He has pushed to revamp NAFTA and confront China. But in renegotiating NAFTA, Trump failed to do the one thing labor unions said was most needed: to make sure that NAFTA’s enforcement mechanisms had teeth so that Mexican workers could push for higher wages and to unionize without being suppressed or jailed.

Moreover, Trump has hugely mishandled his trade war with China. Any child can tell you that if you’re going to pick a fight with a powerful adversary, you want your friends lined up at your side. But Trump launched his trade war against China, the world’s second largest economic power, without getting important allies like Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Australia to fight along with us. As a result of Trump’s unilateral trade war, China is feeling much less pressure and America’s workers, farmers, consumers, and corporations are getting battered. Trump deserves a failing grade for the way he has so badly bungled his trade war.

With just over a week to go before qualifying ends for the fourth Democratic presidential candidate debate, to be held in October, the Democratic National Committee has announced new, higher qualifications for its November debate (place and time still TBD). Since every candidate who qualified for the September event in Houston automatically made the cut for October, this could be the first “winnowing” measure in a good while.

The thresholds for “grassroots fundraising” didn’t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states. While the new thresholds could distort fundraising efforts for more marginal candidates, it’s unlikely any of those on the October stage will fall off in November because of fundraising — unless they just run out of money and drop out of the race (as Cory Booker’s campaign has said might happen to him if it doesn’t reach its third-quarter money goals).

Nor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems. There have been only three qualifying debates so far: two national surveys (NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Fox News) and one from Iowa (Ann Selzer’s poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom). Booker has met the new threshold in two of them; Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, and Andrew Yang have met it in one. October debate qualifier Tom Steyer and possible qualifier Tulsi Gabbard haven’t met any so far; nor have the other candidates who failed to qualify for September.

The new higher but narrower qualifying option for early-state polls is probably tailor-made for Steyer, who can just pick a state or two and spend tens of millions of dollars on ads there. It could also help Klobuchar, who’s predictably doing better in Iowa than she is nationally or in other early states.

All in all, the new qualifying thresholds are mostly of interest to those who are shrieking in anguish at the likely reappearance of a second debate night in October. The odds are reasonably good that at least one or two October qualifiers won’t make it past the higher thresholds and will put the debate stage far beyond reach of the bottom-feeders who stubbornly refuse to drop out. Maybe for its next debate, in December, the DNC could help us out by administering a lie-detector test to see which candidates really believe they have a prayer of finishing in the top six or so in Iowa."

After a temporary hiccup, Iowa Democrats are back on track with a proposal to make their presidential caucuses comply with the national party’s requirements to provide more accessibility to voters who struggle to attend the traditional multi-hour fixed-time-and-location events. A “satellite caucuses” add-on has been unanimously approved by the Democratic National Committee’s Rules and Bylaws panel, which a few weeks ago killed plans from Iowa and Nevada to hold a “virtual caucus” by phone.

Virtual causes were ruled out because of fears about such a system’s clear vulnerability to hacking. Other options Iowa Democrats considered (e.g., mail-in ballots or in-person early voting) would have taken the caucuses too far in the direction of primaries, which might have triggered New Hampshire’s law requiring it to hold the first primary in the nation. Iowa and Nevada could simply have asked for, and probably have secured, a waiver for 2020 letting them go ahead with their past practices. But for Iowans paranoid about losing their first spot in the line of nominating contests, acknowledging an inability to make the caucuses more accessible seemed to give too much ammunition to those who want to blow up the whole calendar with its privileged early states (in order, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina).

The “satellite caucuses” approach is the “accessibility reform” that would least disrupt the traditional system. Here’s how the Iowa Democratic Party describes it:

• The 2020 satellite caucus proposal will allow for additional caucus locations on February 3 to expand participation for people who cannot attend their in-person precinct caucus … • Iowa Democrats can apply to hold a satellite site at places like factories, group homes, or community gathering places, to better accommodate people who cannot attend their in-person caucus. This option will be especially useful for shift workers, Iowans with disabilities, Iowans serving overseas, and students. • The IDP will create a special satellite-caucus review committee that will review applications and determine approval … • The results will be reported using the same method as precinct caucus locations. The satellite caucuses will create one additional county in each congressional district.

These satellite events will be live, not virtual, and will have to take place on the same day as the regular caucuses, February 3, though some provision will be made for variations in the exact starting times. Although giving virtual caucuses (depending on participation) ten percent of the state-delegate-equivalents awards, by which victory in the Iowa Caucuses is measured, had been contemplated, the satellite system will probably be less significant in affecting the outcome. What it most seems to resemble is the system already employed by Nevada in 2016 to accommodate casino and hotel workers who were on duty when the regular caucuses were held:

The Nevada Democratic Party set up six caucus locations on the Las Vegas strip to accommodate shift workers at the hotels and casinos so they don’t have to travel to their home precincts to participate.

Presumably, national party approval of Iowa’s satellite-caucus proposal will make it easy for Nevada to reuse or expand its own 2016 system.

As for Iowa, the satellite caucuses will create an interesting organizational challenge for the various presidential campaigns — and for pollsters and journalists, too. Participation in the new Ann Selzer poll of Iowa, which is creating a buzz in political circles because it shows Elizabeth Warren in the lead, did not mention any options beyond the traditional caucuses (a June Selzer poll had been based on the availability of virtual caucuses “to take place online or by phone on several days leading up to the traditional, in-person caucus meetings on February 3”). It’s possible that Selzer’s sample had been too large in June and too small in September; that’s entirely unclear. But at least now everyone can get onto the same page between now and November.

With four months to go before next year’s Feb. 3 caucuses, the competition for votes is intensifying in Iowa, with most Democrats still grappling with the question of who is best positioned to take on President Trump.

A new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll of likely caucus-goers released Saturday night found surging support for Warren in the race. According to the poll, 22 percent of likely caucus-goers said Warren is their first choice for the Democratic nomination. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 11 percent. No other candidate was in double digits.

The survey was more proof of Warren’s growing popularity in Iowa, where she has attracted large crowds for months. It marked the first notable shake-up in the race. Though Warren’s lead was narrow, Biden had been the polling leader in all three of the Register’s 2020 polls, including the most recent one in June.

The poll was released after a whirlwind day of campaigning at the Steak Fry, which has been an essential Iowa tradition for presidential candidates for the past 40 years since it was launched as a small grass-roots fundraiser for Tom Harkin, a revered Iowa Democrat who retired from the U.S. Senate in 2014. It has long been regarded as one of the best opportunities for a candidate to make a splash among Iowa Democrats and show their organizational force.

Biden, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., each reserved massive spaces to rally their supporters. And like all the campaigns, they each led big parades to the stage, including Harris, who danced with a drum line and hundreds of cheering supporters.

The show of force comes at a pivotal time for Harris, who has been lagging in national and Iowa polls. She announced in the past week that she is going all-in on Iowa in hopes of placing in the top three, a ticket that her campaign hopes could propel her to South Carolina and into Super Tuesday. “I don’t know if you heard,” Harris cheekily said on the stage. “I’m moving to Iowa.”

Harris was not the only candidate looking to the Steak Fry for a jolt of life. While Booker marched into the event with scores of enthusiastic supporters and received a standing ovation from most of the crowd, he offered a more dire assessment of his campaign offstage. He told reporters if he can’t raise $1.7 million in coming days that he will reconsider whether he has the “pathway” to win the nomination. “I don’t believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,” he said. “You either have a trajectory to win or not.”

Biden arrived at the Steak Fry as the national polling leader, with scores of supporters who turned up early to rally with the former vice president. His parade included a firetruck packed with members of the International Association of Firefighters, a union that has endorsed his campaign, which sounded its siren to announce Biden’s entrance into the event.

Biden was immediately swarmed by supporters clamoring for photographs and signatures. He pumped his fist, keeping the rhythm of a chant of his name, and reached through a mass of cameras to shake hands. Racing to a grill, where the candidates each spent time cooking chicken and steak, Biden threw on an apron. “Put me to work,” he said.

Onstage, Biden made no mention of reports that Trump had urged the Ukranian president to open up an investigation into a company with ties to Biden’s son Hunter.

But hours before, at a gaggle with reporters, Biden called Trump’s actions an “overwhelming abuse of power” and urged congressional Democrats to investigate. He also suggested the president’s actions indicated he is worried about winning reelection.

Trump “knows I’ll beat him like a drum,” the former vice president told reporters.

While the Biden campaign bought more than a thousand tickets to hand out to supporters, the Warren campaign bought just 200, gambling that her supporters would turn out without much nudging.

AD

And as the senator from Massachusetts took the stage, thousands of Warren signs popped up into the air.

Afterward, Warren spent more than two hours at her campaign booth, posing for more than 1,000 selfies in what has become her signature campaign move. Among those waiting in line was Trey Hill, a middle school teacher from Ankeny, who said he’d narrowed down his choices to Warren, Buttigieg and Sanders.

AD

“For Warren, for me, it was definitely . . . her confidence, her just sheer strength and determination to fight for what she believes in. I’m really interested in Bernie just because he is kind of the impetus to this revolution that we have going on,” Hill said. “And Pete, I just think that he’s one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever heard speak and I think that he’s got a mind to really take this country really far.”

When he got to the front of the line, a Warren aide took Hill’s phone; he would have about three seconds with the senator.

“I’m with you in this fight!” Hill blurted out.

“Absolutely, thank you!” Warren told him.

They both support what would be a massive economic restructuring with ideas such as Medicare-for-all, but Sanders, 78, has carved out his brand as a democratic socialist while Warren, 70, has described herself as a capitalist who has operated more as part of the Democratic mainstream. While Sanders drew notice in 2016 for his avid fans and big crowds, it is Warren this time who is gaining traction that way.

AD

These challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders’s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign quietly fired its Iowa political director in the late summer and has yet to name a replacement — a key vacancy as the race enters a crucial phase, with less than five months to go before the February caucuses.

Sanders’s difficulties in Iowa have come into sharper focus over the weekend. The most respected pollster in the state released a survey late Saturday showing Warren surging to 22 percent, two points ahead of former vice president Joe Biden, with Sanders at 11 percent. That places him third in the state where he fought Hillary Clinton to a near draw in 2016, launching an electrifying national movement.

AD

Perhaps more worrisome for Sanders, the poll provided the clearest indication yet that Warren is eating into his base. She is winning a bigger share of people who caucused for Sanders in 2016 than he is, and she is outpacing him among those under 35, his former strong suit, according to the survey conducted by Selzer and Co. for the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom.

AD

“I give him tremendous credit for changing the conversation,” said Rod Sullivan, a Johnson County supervisor who introduced Sanders at a campaign stop in 2015 and now backs Warren. “We need to get that kind of stuff done and I think there’s a better way to get it done now. Last time was a binary choice and this time I think there are better messengers.”

Sanders campaign officials, dismissing the notion that their candidate is struggling, vowed Sunday to plow ahead with aggressive moves to win the Iowa caucuses. The Sanders campaign announced last week it has attracted 1 million individual donors, a historic mark that officials said is a strong sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy.

AD

“Unlike Bernie Sanders, polls are inconsistent and all over the place, including an Iowa poll that came a few days ago,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. “We feel good about our field operation in the state and our team is working harder and harder each day to urge people to caucus for a once-in-a-lifetime candidate.”

AD

Sanders will embark Monday on a “Bernie Beats Trump” tour across the state, an effort to argue that he is the most electable choice against President Trump in 2020. But his more immediate obstacle is Warren, whom he has refrained from criticizing, though some of his surrogates have been more aggressive.

Sanders has sought to stand out from the pack by emphasizing his decades-long advocacy of sweeping ideas such as Medicare-for-all, something he did at a Sunday rally in Warren’s childhood hometown of Norman, Okla.

AD

“It is unique and maybe unique in American history,” Sanders said of his campaign, as he encouraged supporters to join a nationwide grass-roots movement. After they started chanting his name, he replied, “It ain’t Bernie, it’s you.”

For loyal followers such as C.J. Petersen of Breda, Iowa, Sanders’s consistency merits support at the caucuses. “Senator Warren is fantastic,” the 29-year-old said. “But Bernie has been on these issues in the very beginning.”

AD

But for many others, that’s no longer enough. Matt Shockley, a 24-year-old teacher from Oklahoma City who attended the Sanders rally in Norman, said he voted for Sanders in 2016, but now is leaning toward Warren.

AD

“She’s very warm as a person and she has her own kind of charisma,” he said. “I think that will really help in the general. And on policy, she and Bernie are so similar, it doesn’t feel like there’s much of a trade-off in voting for her over him.”

As the Sanders campaign tries to hang on to voters like Shockley, employee disputes and staff shake-ups have jolted the senator’s organization, stretching from important early states to the Washington headquarters, leading to firings, resignations, tense meetings and fierce rivalries, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

In New Hampshire, where Sanders defeated Clinton by 22 points but is now in close competition with Warren and Biden, Sanders recently changed state directors. The operation had been tumultuous for months, people with knowledge with the situation said.

AD

AD

Some of the internal friction has touched the highest levels of the campaign. A dispute over salaries earlier this year pitted rank-and-file field staff against campaign management. On a conference call the day after a Washington Post report about the standoff, Shakir bluntly warned any leakers to quickly leave the campaign, speaking in a tone that angered some participants, people with knowledge of the call said.

The Post interviewed 30 present and past Sanders aides, allies and voters for this report. Many who described the tension in the campaign spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.

Warren has been building a robust operation in Iowa that many local Democratic strategists said is the most impressive in the field. She has been picking off former Sanders backers, including some of his earliest champions.

AD

AD

The Sanders campaign brushed aside questions about firing its Iowa political director, Jess Mazour, in the late summer. “We’ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,” Shakir said in a written statement after The Post contacted the campaign last week. Mazour did not respond to requests for comment.

Although friction and turnover are not uncommon in the high-pressure environment of presidential campaigns, the extent of the discord in the Sanders operation has surprised some Democrats inside and outside the campaign. They say it reflects a departure from Sanders’s 2016 effort.

“As presidential campaigns go, the 2016 Sanders campaign had less conflict than most,” said Mark Longabaugh, a lead strategist on that run who abruptly parted ways with the campaign on the eve of Sanders’s entrance into the 2020 race.

AD

AD

Sanders campaign officials played down the personnel changes and said his unique platform of demanding revolutionary change will ultimately propel him to victory.

“Senator Sanders is very confident. He is feeling good about the campaign. We believe this race is down to the three people and we have the best ground game,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of Sanders’s national co-chairs.

Khanna was speaking about Warren and Biden, who along with Sanders, have appeared at the top of most recent state and national surveys.

Inside the Sanders campaign in New Hampshire, there were issues at the top levels of the campaign from its earliest days. State director Joe Caiazzo and senior strategist Kurt Ehrenberg, two veterans of the 2016 campaign, were in constant conflict, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

AD

The workplace situation became so strained earlier this year that a human resources official had to intervene, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

Caiazzo and Ehrenberg declined to comment for this story. Caiazzo was recently reassigned to run the Sanders campaign in Massachusetts and Ehrenberg is no longer with the campaign.

Shakir said the personnel decisions were of no concern. “We’ve built a great team in New Hampshire and are in a really strong position there,” Shakir said in a statement explaining the moves.

Yet for some Sanders supporters, the New Hampshire Democratic convention earlier this month served as a sobering moment. In a state where Sanders won just over 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 primary, he was no longer the top draw.

Sanders took the stage in Manchester to a rousing ovation, to as many full chairs as anyone then had earned, and to a room of waving signs bearing his name. It was louder than the reception greeting for anyone else — until Warren took the stage to a two-minute ovation not long after."

Elizabeth Warren: 22 percent Former vice president Joe Biden: 20 Sen. Bernie Sanders: 11 South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg: 9 Sen. Kamala D. Harris: 6 Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 3

With that big poll now public, here are some overarching questions for the broader 2020 race.

1. How much trouble is Bernie Sanders in (especially in Iowa)?

The big news this weekend was that Warren had overtaken Biden (albeit still within the margin of error) in the new poll. But that wasn’t all that far-fetched given Warren’s ascendancy.

Perhaps the second biggest piece of news in the poll was that Sanders’s Iowa troubles appear to be very real. We had seen some evidence of this before, but now it seems safe to say it. Of the last four live-caller polls in Iowa, Sanders is at 11 percent in this one and 9 percent in the three previous ones. He does better in online polls, but every high-quality poll has him lagging behind his national showing.

AD

AD

Why is that important? Because he nearly won the state in 2016, yet early signs suggest he’s not even an option for many voters there. Another poll last week showed more likely caucusgoers had ruled out supporting him (46 percent) than were considering it (43 percent.)

It’s also important because national polls still have them running neck and neck for second place. Given that both Sanders and Warren hail from a state that neighbors New Hampshire (Sanders from Vermont and Warren from Massachusetts), the one who finishes better in Iowa would seem to have the inside track ahead of the Granite State’s primary.

And if one of them drops out at that point, it could reshape the race.

AD

2. How will Elizabeth Warren wear?

Warren is the one candidate with demonstrated momentum pretty much throughout the 2020 race. Being in the lead in Iowa would seem to be the culmination of all that.

AD

But she’s thus far largely avoided her opponents’ fire, and that’s starting to change. She has also in the past struggled to deal with the controversy over her past claim of Native American heritage, muddling through efforts to put it behind her. Then there is the electability issue — however fair — when it comes to Democrats nominating another polarizing, intellectual woman, this time a former Harvard University professor from Massachusetts.

And for Warren and Sanders, their problem is that the NBC/WSJ poll shows their stances on some issues -- like single-payer -- are out of step with the rest of the country pic.twitter.com/uRwIKB6BsT — Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) September 23, 2019

It’s too easy to caricature Warren as an unelectable extremist. But Democratic voters are completely preoccupied with nominating someone — anyone — who can beat Trump. The same new Iowa poll shows twice as many emphasized that (63 percent) as emphasized agreement on the issues (31 percent).

AD

They seem to like Warren in a way they don’t like the others; her main task is persuading them to vote with their heart while believing in their minds that it will work out. The good news for her is she seems to be doing that, at least in Iowa, where she’s tied with Biden at 22 percent with electability-first voters.

AD

We’ll see if that holds — and if the rest of the country begins to agree.

3. Is Joe Biden’s electability edge ironclad?

Related to the point above: If Warren is the candidate of Democrats’ hearts, Biden is the choice of their minds. Nearly every poll shows he is viewed as the most electable. So if Democrats just want to win, he should be able to stick around.

AD

But just as we should challenge our assumptions about Warren’s electability deficit, we should challenge them about Biden’s electability edge.

Part of that is because Biden is the most well-known candidate in the race who is also easiest to see in the role of a president — in large part because he was right next to one for eight years. We shouldn’t discount how much this is because he’s simply the biggest known quantity in the field and thus makes the most sense for casual voters.

AD

It’s also worth questioning whether he’ll maintain that perception. Biden’s previous presidential runs haven’t gone well, and there have already been plenty of stumbles early in his 2020 campaign. It’s one thing to be the vice president whom people can see being president; it’s another to be the candidate who can’t quite shoot straight. If he can’t be as compelling or as steady as Warren or other candidates, perhaps Democrats will start to adjust their preconceptions about how he might fare in the general election.

AD

4. Is Biden’s black support sustainable?

A big reason Biden continues to lead in national polling — even as he doesn’t do as well in Iowa and New Hampshire — is black voters.

Even after tangling with Harris on busing and criticism from another black candidate, Sen. Cory Booker, about Biden’s comments about working with segregationist senators, Biden is still above 40 percent with African Americans in most polls. A recent poll of the South Carolina primary showed him taking 51 percent of that demographic there.

AD

This demographic advantage was huge for Hillary Clinton in 2016; Sanders’s inability to appeal to black voters basically made him unelectable in a party whose nominating process they play such a major role in (around one-quarter of all voters).

AD

As Philip Bump has written, black voters may not be the silver bullet for Biden that they were for Clinton. But it’s his most loyal demographic in the 2020 race right now, and it’s the one keeping him in the lead nationally. If he can maintain that through the early states and especially heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday, he’ll stand a good chance. If he can’t, the math becomes much more difficult.

5. What’s the deal with Pete Buttigieg?

We’ve talked about the first three candidates in that Iowa poll. The fourth one, though, is a major X-Factor.

AD

The new Iowa poll shows Buttigieg has the second-highest favorable rating in Iowa (behind Warren), at 69 percent. He also has the lowest unfavorable rating of anyone (Warren included), at 13 percent. People really like the guy. And so do donors, judging by Buttigieg’s surprise win in the second-quarter fundraising race.

AD

But the same Iowa voters who really like him also still have him in fourth place, at 9 percent — behind candidates they don’t like as much.

The easy and perhaps overly simplistic explanation is that maybe they like the South Bend, Ind., mayor — and quite a bit — but that they can’t necessarily see the boyish 37-year-old as their president or as being capable of beating Trump. An alternate explanation is that they are warm to him even if they haven’t quite been convinced. That suggests they could eventually come around, which is pretty much all he could ask at this point, given where he started this race.

There has been a lot of talk about how Buttigieg maybe hasn’t delivered on that fundraising. He seems to have plenty of upside, though. And the fact that he’s not alienating key voters is significant.

The poll was conducted Sept. 14-18 among 602 probable caucusgoers, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Filling out the top five were Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.). Buttigieg, whose campaign had a commanding presence at Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry, fell by 6 percentage points from the June poll.

Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) were both at 3 percent, ahead of a cluster of candidates registering at 2 percent and eight others polling at 1 percent or less.

The results show considerable room for movement over the next half-year. Only 1 in 5 likely caucusgoers said they were set on their first-choice candidate, while 63 percent said they could envision supporting someone else.

AD

Sixty-three percent also said it was more important to them that the winner of the Iowa caucuses could beat President Trump than that the victor in February shared their positions on major issues.

AD

Warren has steadily gained ground in the Register’s polling, starting at 8 percent in December, before she had announced her candidacy. She came in at 9 percent in March and 15 percent in June.

The June poll differed from the survey whose results were released Saturday in seeking to take into account Iowa’s plan for a “virtual caucus,” which has since been scrapped because of concerns about whether phone technology could be secured against hacking.

A Monmouth University poll released last month suggested the addition of an option to participate over the phone, rather than attending an hours-long meeting in the biting cold, would have expanded support for Biden. The new poll reverted to the methodology of the first two Register surveys, which considered only in-person participation.

Jodi Stanfield, a volunteer for Warren in Des Moines, said she previously supported Sanders and admired both candidates, whose platforms she described as similarly ambitious on issues of health care and education. She now favors Warren because she can “actually get the work done,” said Stanfield, 51, who works at the YMCA of Greater Des Moines.

Former vice president Joe Biden repeatedly declares on the stump: “I’m a union guy.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has picketed with unions across the country and includes the Woody Guthrie song “Union Maid” in his pre-rally warm-up music.

And when GM workers walked off the job last week, Democratic presidential candidates hastily arranged visits to picket lines.

On Thursday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told Detroit autoworkers they should be rewarded for making concessions “when this company was in some bad straits.” On Sunday, Biden spoke to a local union in Kansas City, Kan., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) picketed with workers in Detroit. Sanders plans to visit in coming days.

AD

Biden donned a red union shirt and told workers in Kansas City that his father sold GM cars, which helped put Biden through school. He said he saw the impact of plant closures on communities in his home state of Delaware.

AD

“None of it’s left,” he said of Delaware’s auto plants, “and a lot of people have been left behind.”

What GM is doing might be legal, Biden said, but it’s not moral.

“When things started to go well, what did they do?” Biden asked the crowd from the back of a pickup truck. “They raised salaries for the CEO.”

Biden said putting a Democrat in the White House was key to the future of labor.

“If we don’t win this, and I say this with all earnestness, if the folks that share my view don’t win this, a lot of unions are in trouble,” he said.

AD

The Detroit-Hamtramck plant where Warren and Klobuchar visited makes the Cadillac CT6 and the Chevrolet Impala. It’s slated to be closed by GM by 2020 — at the cost of about 800 jobs — though picketing workers hope the company will open an electric truck facility there.

AD

Speaking to a small crowd of workers and reporters at the plant Sunday, Warren blasted GM for closing five plants around the United States despite making “billions of dollars in profits” last year.

“GM is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America, or to the people of America. Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line,” Warren said. “And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, or to Asia, or anywhere else on this planet, they will do it. Well, the workers of the UAW are here to say, ‘No more!’ ”

AD

Returning to a pillar of her campaign message, Warren credited unions with building America’s middle class — and said “when unions win, all Americans win.” As she spoke, chants of “UAW! UAW!” broke out.

It’s unclear, however, if the message is resonating. Unions have been slow to endorse candidates in the expansive Democratic primary, which once included two dozen candidates.

AD

And Trump has claimed that even if union leaders publicly support Democrats, union members are on his side. In April, after the International Association of Fire Fighters endorsed Biden, Trump dismissed the importance of the endorsement.

“The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me. Some things never change!” he wrote on Twitter.

AD

Larry Jones, 64, a GM employee for 44 years who was picketing at the Detroit-Hamtramck facility Tuesday, said he understood that his plight depends not just on the whims of GM’s board, but also on the policies of the person who occupies the White House.

Trump’s report card, he added, has been a subject of debate both on the picket lines and, before then, in company break rooms.

“All this stuff he’s saying about the jobs he’s going to keep — jobs are still going to Mexico,” Jones said. “I know some of them that voted for Trump. I understand where they’re coming from. They wanted to give him a chance. He was a businessman, he was rich, he wasn’t beholden to anybody. They wanted a change, and they got it. But change isn’t always good.”

AD

AD

While campaigning, Trump vowed to roll back Obama-era regulations on business, including appointing a Republican-controlled National Labor Relations Board that critics say has dealt a blow to workers’ rights.

Other autoworkers said Trump is anything but anti-worker, as evidenced by his stance on NAFTA and trade policy with China.

“We like Donald Trump because he’s fighting for us,” said Brian Pannebecker, an autoworker who runs the “Autoworkers for Trump 2020” Facebook group, which includes conservative and pro-Trump political messages with photos and news clips about the ongoing strike. “He said he was going to get rid of NAFTA, and he did. Everybody up here hates it. It’s not perfect, but it’s a good start. And now he’s finally pushing back against China, who’s been eating our lunch for years. Donald Trump said those days are over.”

AD

AD

Last year, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to replace NAFTA with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, though it has not yet been ratified by Congress.

Pannebecker and like-minded autoworkers feel “the Democrats are standing in the way,” he said. “Donald Trump is trying to keep his campaign promises. The Democrats are trying to sabotage his presidency.”

When it comes to the union vote, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said the people who want to be president have to do more than put on a union T-shirt or pick up a pro-union picket sign.

“That’s not enough anymore,” she said last week as she handed out candy to striking workers. “I think they’re going to vote for the person who’s not taking corporate money. You’ve got to be pro-union, plus you’ve got to support access to health care. You have to be pro-climate. You have to support a living wage.”

Dan Best, a forklift operator who has worked for GM for 35 years, said he had heard rumors Sunday morning that Warren might stop by the picket line but thought he would miss her because he was standing at the plant’s east gate, instead of the main gate about a quarter-mile away.

When Warren appeared Sunday afternoon after all, Best was “ecstatic.” She lingered at the side entrance for about five minutes — long enough to take some pictures and voice her support for the striking workers there — but Best said even the brief visit did a lot to buoy their spirits.

“I was just so pleased to have her support,” Best said. “I think a lot of people were surprised. We were just really happy to see her. It means a lot to us.”

DES MOINES — In just 24 hours, the candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination gathered to endorse a bold LGBTQ rights agenda, spoke to the largest outdoor “steak fry” in the party's history and watched a new poll reshape the wisdom about the caucuses.

Not a whole lot really changed. Policy disagreements were minor at the GLAAD forum in Cedar Rapids: Every candidate agreed to pass the Equality Act and reinstate Obama-era protections. The weekend’s big arguments were mostly imported by TV, from Stephen Colbert’s questions to Elizabeth Warren about tax increases to the scandal over President Trump plying Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden. (More about that below.) But with each week, the field settles a little more, and the straggling candidates see their problems a little more clearly.

The Elizabeth Warren backlash is coming. Even before the release of the Des Moines Register's Selzer & Co. poll, which put Warren at 22 percent support to Joe Biden's 20 percent, the senator from Massachusetts had reshaped the Democratic primary. Six months ago, some rival campaigns had written her off. Two months ago, no candidate saw an upside in attacking her. But that was then, and now, Warren is the only Democratic candidate who has successfully executed her initial plan: to build massive campaigns in the early states and compete for a win in Iowa.

Warren’s strength was visible all weekend, from the standing ovation she got at Friday’s LGBTQ forum to the friendliest audience at the steak fry. (Warren’s campaign bought half as many tickets as that of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, but her speech got roughly the same response as his, and she edged him in a friendly corn kernel poll on-site.) She made two sharp moves that did not occur to other leading candidates: reading to the Cedar Rapids audience the names of trans women of color who had been killed in 2019 and starting her steak fry speech with a fresh call for Trump’s impeachment.

According to the Selzer poll, Warren is now the most well-liked Democrat in the field, with the most first-choice and second-choice support from voters. The other 16 candidates competing for Iowa can’t allow that. By the end of Saturday, Warren had taken some flack from the left, for telling the People’s Action forum in Des Moines (limited to a few left-wing candidates) that she did not support a national rent control policy; Sanders does. She’d gotten some blowback from the party’s centrists, though they had been harsher in interviews leading up to the weekend.

“We won the House back in 2018 with Democrats running on a public option, not Medicare-for-all,” Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said at the steak fry.

The temptation in looking at any caucus is to compare it to past years. In 2003, Howard Dean surged with liberal voters before panic set in that he couldn’t win the general election. In 2015, Republicans ignored Donald Trump’s rise or actively encouraged it — think of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas saying Trump was “terrific” — because they incorrectly believed he’d eventually collapse.

Warren, who has twice defended herself from attacks in debates, doesn’t resemble either candidate, but there’s a growing irritation at the how-she-does it media coverage she gets. Supporters of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) grumbled that she got a sterner question than Warren about their shared “evolution” on using Medicare money to pay for gender transition. No candidate has thrived from going after a rival, least of all by attacking Warren, but when the media's focus turns to a candidate, things can change fast.

Bernie Sanders is struggling. In June, when the “Selzer poll” found the senator from Vermont's support at just 16 percent, the Sanders campaign insisted that the pollster was not capturing the strength of its game plan. They claimed to have 26,000 “volunteers” in the state — a number based on initial sign-ups when he entered the race — and to be activating voters who had never caucused before and, as such, didn’t show up in public polls.

Since then, the Sanders campaign has parted with its Iowa political director and deputy director, admitting what it won’t say: The plan wasn’t working. Sanders is now less popular with Democrats than he was four years ago. Thirty-six percent of caucusgoers view him unfavorably, when just 8 percent held that view in the autumn before the 2016 caucus.

Sanders has declined without making any traditional mistakes. When asked in the Selzer poll how they defined “electability,” a supermajority of Iowa Democrats — 74 percent — said it was “exciting new voters to show up.” That's exactly what Sanders has been arguing for years that he can do. At the steak fry, like at every “cattle call,” Sanders eschewed big shows of enthusiasm to emphasize organizing. His campaign claimed to have made 26,000 phone calls and knocked 5,000 doors during the event.

But it hasn't solved Sanders's central problem: He has reactivated his donor base but hasn't reunited his electoral coalition. Refusing to attack Warren, Sanders has instead proposed policies that go further than hers, such as canceling all medical debt and imposing national rent control to stabilize housing. So far it hasn't stopped active Democrats from migrating to the candidates they like more.

Cory Booker is struggling and strangely happy to talk about it. Booker is one of several Democrats doing everything that Iowans ask — showing up, getting crowds, growing more popular — and seeing no benefit in polls or momentum. His campaign decided to do something about that Saturday, announcing that he would need to raise an oddly specific $1.7 million or quit the race. According to Booker’s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, Iowans liked Booker but didn’t realize how precarious his situation was.

“They think he's fine, and they think they have more time to decide,” Demissie said on a conference call. “They think that this thing is going to narrow over the coming months … but the point that we're trying to make very clearly is that the [candidates] offered to the Democratic Party come February, March, and April are being determined right now, in September. And these resources ultimately are what determines who is going to stay in this race.”

Booker’s campaign claimed to have raised more than $300,000 since the do-or-die announcement, and the senator from New Jersey really is in a better position than other candidates in the single digits. In the Selzer poll, Booker’s net favorable rating (the percentage of voters who like him, minus the percentage who don’t) is 38 percent, compared with 36 in June. Outside the Warren-Biden-Sanders triad at the top of the polls, just Booker and three other Democrats have double-digit favorables: Harris’s net rating is 39 percent, Klobuchar’s is 30 percent, O’Rourke’s is 28 percent. The race has stratified between seven Democrats who most Iowa voters generally like and nine Democrats to whom they’re either negative or indifferent.

TV ads haven't done much. On Aug. 8, Harris's campaign went on the Iowa airwaves for the first time. On Aug. 20, Biden's campaign joined in. And on Sept. 6, after airing a pair of radio spots about the mayor's post-partisan American Dream, Buttigieg's campaign boiled them down into a TV ad.

All three of these Democrats were flat, or had lost support, in the latest Selzer poll. Harris and Biden had seen their unfavorable ratings double over the past six months, while Buttigieg grew more popular; his strength as a second-choice candidate has been growing, even as fewer voters say he's their first choice. But the only obvious effect of TV advertising so far has been putting Tom Steyer, who has spent millions on commercials, onto the board; he clocked in at 2 percent, though more Democrats viewed him unfavorably than favorably. Big TV buys used to do more.

The “virtual caucus” is dead. It didn't get much fanfare, and there was no grilled meat involved, but shortly before the weekend started, Iowa Democrats announced the solution to their years-long problem of trying to boost participation in the caucuses. The DNC rules committee “tentatively” approved a plan to add “satellite” caucus sites in 2020, where voters who have given a reason that they cannot physically attend the caucuses can be counted.

“Each satellite location will have a trained captain who is charged with overseeing the room, managing volunteers, and reporting the results on caucus night. The results will be reported using the same method as precinct caucus locations,” the state party announced Friday. “The satellite caucuses will create one additional county in each Congressional District.”

The new system will (unless it changes again) work quasi-absentee votes into the caucus count; it won’t create a separate, online pool of votes for a “virtual caucus.” The few polls conducted of that “virtual” contest found Joe Biden, who’s more popular with moderates than liberals, doing very well. Nixing it may help the campaigns with traditional grass-roots campaigns and activist energy.

WHAT I'M WATCHING

After the first reports that the president might have pressured Ukraine's president to get dirt on his son, Joe Biden told reporters that Trump should “start to be the president” and stop abusing his powers. The next day, at the steak fry, Biden took a question from a Fox News reporter — how many times had he talked to Hunter Biden about his “overseas business” dealings? Biden said he’d never talked to him about it, then let rip.

“I know Trump deserves to be investigated,” Biden. “He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate him, if that’s what happened?” After accusing the president of “abuse of power” and saying he’d “beat him like a drum,” Biden was asked whether the president should be impeached: “Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached, but I’m not making that judgment right now.”

Both the Friday and Saturday exchanges with reporters came from the same premise: Biden, campaigning to restore the pre-Trump norms of good government, was saying that Trump was breaking those norms to smear him. Other candidates might get into the mix with the president, but Biden has positioned himself as a back-to-normalcy candidate: “America is coming back like it used to be,” like he said when he launched. His approach to the president is a mix of disappointment, disbelief and shame.

None of that gives Trump pause. On Sunday, Trump said without evidence that “Biden and his son” were adding to “the corruption already in the Ukraine,” then taunted Biden for saying he had not spoken to his son: “Of course you spoke to your son!” Later, on talk shows, the president’s surrogates inside and outside the administration, who have brushed aside questions about actions of the president’s kin, advanced the completely unproved accusations of Biden family corruption.

“If it's the case that there was something going on with the president or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that,” said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“I think the bigger story here is really what went on with Biden and his son?” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “He came out over the weekend and said he never spoke to his son. Yet the facts are his son said they had spoken.” And Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, went even further, going on Fox News to call Hunter Biden a “recovering drug addict” and stoke speculation that his deals in Ukraine were subjects for the former vice president to answer.

Democrats don’t know how this will play. But they know how similar tactics played in 2016. At that time, the president exploited voter worries about Hillary Clinton by turning any accusation he could back onto her, most dramatically by inviting women who’d accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second presidential debate. Clinton was hamstrung by the impression that she could not be trusted, and both she and Trump lurched into Election Day with most voters saying that they found neither of them to be “honest and trustworthy.”

Biden, after a lifetime in politics, does not have a similar image. He famously did not get rich during his years in the Senate. Having watched anger boil over at Clinton for giving high-priced speeches, he approached his post-vice presidency career cautiously. The media reception to Trump’s Ukraine gambit has been incredibly skeptical, similar to the reaction when Trump made baseless charges against Republican opponents in 2015.

But Trump’s party was not united behind him then; now it is. Democrats were largely united around Hillary Clinton when Trump made his 2016 attacks; they are not united behind Biden. Only a few of his rivals have commented on the back-and-forth, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) telling the president to “leave Joe Biden alone” and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) kicking off her steak fry remarks by referring to Trump's actions.

“It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,” Warren said.

Biden hadn't called for impeachment, only investigation. For nine months, the president really hasn't had much of a role in the Democratic primary; candidates have been more responsive to the left's demands than to anything Trump is saying. Attacking Biden could backfire and rally Democrats around him. In the short term, it's making him demonstrate how he'd handle the specious attacks that Trump embraced again and again in 2016. He's more able to punch back than Hillary Clinton, but his overall theory is the same: Ask voters to consider whether they really want Trump's ethics in the White House.

Eddie Rispone, “One Thing.” The wealthy businessman in Louisiana's three-way race for governor has gone up with negative spots about Gov. John Bel Edwards, asking whether the Democrat has made the state less safe. While the state's GOP legislature signed off on criminal justice restructuring, Rispone has spotlighted some of the violent criminals who benefited from it to warn about consequences: “Criminal justice is one thing; releasing dangerous criminals is another.”

Tate Reeves, “Tough Call.” The GOP nominee for governor has struggled to hold on to partisan support because of anger at his tight fiscal policies, which have made teachers mad and stoked worries about weak infrastructure. In his latest spot, Reeves continues to argue that this is an asset, marveling at how legislators went ""crazy"" about his spending cuts. ""Mississippi's got less debt today than when I got elected; first time in history,” he says.

The crosstabs and sub-questions in this poll portray a very muddled Democratic Iowa primary electorate, with the top three candidates commanding less first-choice support than in any recent contest. At this point in 2007, in this poll, 74 percent of Democrats picked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John Edwards as their first choice; the combined support for the top candidates now is 53 percent. And there are other reasons so many candidates in the doldrums see a potential comeback if the race keeps shuffling and if Joe Biden — the only top candidate not running from the left — loses more support.

For now, the poll positions Warren as the candidate with the most first-choice and second-choice support, stitching together a coalition of liberals who backed Sanders in 2016 and Hillary Clinton supporters; Sanders gets no support from Clinton 2016 voters. Looming over her is the Medicare-for-all question, and for reasons very familiar to nervous Democrats. Most caucusgoers support Medicare-for-all, with 41 percent saying they like it and just 24 percent coming out against it. The crucial swing vote: the 28 percent of Democrats who say they personally like the policy but fret that it would hurt the party in a general election. Warren leads Biden by four points with these voters, with big implications.

There are years when many candidates for president are popular. This is not one of those years. This poll, which also pushes voters for answers on every major Democratic proposal (replacing private insurance is unpopular, a large immigration amnesty is not), finds that no Democratic candidate would start the election with as much active opposition as the president but that none is particularly popular.

While Biden outperforms other Democrats in trial heats, and while his coalition does not entirely overlap with Warren's, he has about the same level of support and opposition; Sanders, who for a long time was the most broadly popular candidate, has the lowest ceiling of support. The Democratic “electability” conversation has not changed much recently, but the numbers have.

IN THE STATES

Massachusetts. Rep. Joe Kennedy III started his Senate campaign with a whirlwind tour of Massachusetts and nothing bad to say about Sen. Ed Markey, who he'd be replacing if he won. Markey challenged Kennedy and lesser-known opponents to a climate debate, possibly to highlight how Markey has been a left-wing leader on the issue and Kennedy has been an ally, but not a lead messenger.

Mississippi. Jennifer Riley Collins, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, would be the first woman to hold the office and the first black woman elected to any statewide job. But she has not been endorsed by Attorney General Jim Hood, the Democrats' nominee for governor; she has pressured Hood to endorse her, without success. Hood, the only statewide elected Democrat, has largely run on his own ticket.

2020

Bill de Blasio’s presidential campaign ended Friday, but the indignities were not over. On Sunday, Selzer & Co. released the year’s third Iowa poll, with the remarkable fact that no one — no one in three polls over six months — had listed the mayor of New York City as their top choice for president. No one had listed him as their second choice, either. De Blasio’s campaign ended without much praise from rival candidates and with, unsurprisingly, a gleeful New York Post obituary on the tabloid’s front page.

“Like NYC mayors before me, I knew what I signed up for,” de Blasio texted BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith.

What did de Blasio’s campaign accomplish? Not much. He did not build out grass-roots campaigns in the early states, appearing instead at party events and meet-and-greets. (The worst of these, which even the mayor had to admit was funny, was a video chat appearance at the Iowa AFL-CIO meeting in which a glitch raised de Blasio’s voice to an “Alvin and the Chipmunks” pitch.)

He had a memorable premise, that there was plenty of wealth in America but in “the wrong hands.” But he didn’t shift the debate on his terms like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren had; his idea of a “robot tax” to fight automation went mostly unnoticed.

De Blasio’s biggest impact came in the televised debates; he qualified for two of them, before the standards tightened in September, and he ensured that former Alaska senator Mike Gravel would not make it. (Gravel’s campaign qualified for the first two debates thanks to hitting 65,000 individual donations.) In June and July, de Blasio emerged as a pugilist on Sanders’s and Warren’s behalf, raising his hand when asked whether he would eliminate private insurance, then aggressively defending the idea.

Bernie Sanders. He took another jab at Joe Biden during a Thursday event in Chapel Hill, N.C., chiding the former vice president for his fundraising schedule: “Joe, we are not going to make the changes we need in this country when you go to three fundraisers in Chicago sponsored by multimillionaires.” Sanders is campaigning in Oklahoma on Sunday before returning to Iowa on a “Bernie beats Trump” tour.

Pete Buttigieg. The steak fry was the start of a four-day swing through Iowa; Buttigieg is traveling through the northeastern part of the states on his first campaign bus tour, through Tuesday.

Joe Biden. He headed to Kansas City and St. Louis to raise money after the steak fry; Sunday he addressed striking GM workers in Kansas City. On Monday he'll attend the funeral of Emily Clyburn, the late wife of the House majority whip.

Elizabeth Warren. She joined striking autoworkers in Detroit on Sunday, in support of the UAW's demand for higher wages and permanent job offers for temporary employees. Earlier, Tim Ryan made a mini-road trip of strike locations, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) rallied with workers during her “blue wall” trip to Michigan.

Ben: President Trump’s repeated suggestion to Ukraine’s president that he investigate Joe Biden, and whether he dangled money in exchange for such an investigation, is such egregious and obvious misconduct that some Democrats who had been on the fence about impeachment seem to be coming around; even Nancy Pelosi is gesturing that she might get there eventually. We here at Intelligencer HQ have not exactly been gung ho on impeachment — Jon and I have been opposed, and Eric has been in the middle — compared with the majority of Democrats who are all-in, according to polls. Does this change your thinking?

Jon: I am unsure but starting to move closer to pro-impeachment, though my position is in part an axiomatic response to what Congress thinks — the more Congress supports impeachment, the better an idea it is in my view.

The worst outcome would be an impeachment resolution that fails. Next worst, a resolution that gets 218 votes. At minimum, you need close to all the Democrats, plus Justin Amash, the one Republican who has supported impeachment. When you get close to unanimity among Democrats, that’s when the idea hits a threshold of being a good idea. (That’s my view, not saying that’s the only view — others disagree).

Eric: I’ve been agnostic on impeachment, on the grounds that whether or not it’s a good idea depends almost entirely on whether it helps or hurts Trump’s reelection prospects. And there is some reason to believe it would perversely help Trump on the margins — polls suggest impeachment is unpopular, particularly with the very strange subset of the population that still isn’t sure which team it’s on; Republicans did extremely poorly in that one midterm after impeaching Clinton. On the other hand, forcing Susan Collins to cast a vote directly abetting Trump’s lawlessness could help Dems secure a critical Senate seat. And there are some plausible arguments out there that impeachment would create a media environment that would ultimately undermine Trump. In my view, it seems impossible for anyone to know exactly how all this would play out.

As Trump’s high crimes and misdemeanors grow more numerous and audacious, the moralistic case for erring on the side of “doing your constitutional duty” does get harder for me to dismiss, though.

Jon: I am still annoyed by the moralistic case. To me, it’s 100 percent practical: If you think the result will help Trump hold power, do not do it, full stop. Now, that is a debatable thing, as you say. But the fact that people keep asserting moralistically that we must do it makes me very distrustful of the whole crusade. They’re broadcasting that they don’t care what the outcome is or that they don’t see how morality could override the practical impact. In what world is “We helped Trump win, but we did the right thing” a sensible argument that people would make after the 2020 election?

Eric: Yeah, I guess it’s not the moralism I find compelling so much as … the possibility that the moralists may actually be right that pursuing impeachment would have an inhibiting effect on Trump’s transgressions — if only because it would commandeer his attention, leaving less free time for crimes.

Jon: I agree, that is very possible.

Ben: Both of your points get to the heart of why I’m struggling with this question. Before this latest revelation, I was anti-impeachment because (1) the majority of voters were not in favor of doing it, and it would likely alienate some of them, at least to an extent; (2) Trump will certainly be acquitted and have his triumphant moment; and (3) it is unlikely to make him any more unpopular, in my opinion, despite what pro-impeachment voices think. Those three objections still hold water, I think, but to just sit there while he openly undermines an upcoming election may be a bridge too far for me. I do think voters will understand going to war over this more than they do relitigating obstruction in a Russia investigation they never cared much about. So the practical case is slightly better than it was, and the moral case (sorry, Jon) is getting to be overwhelming. And there’s the fact that I was never fully confident that impeachment would actually hurt a Democrat’s reelection chances — nobody really knows.

Jon: Morals! [Spits on ground] I think the main hurt is the 40 Democratic seat-flippers. The presidential nominee would be fine, I think, but House members could get hurt for voting to impeach, which is why I think the right move is to listen to them (which Pelosi is obviously doing).

Eric: As the ranks of secretly anti-Trump retiring House Republicans multiply, I do wonder if a couple of them can be won over to Team Amash. It would help the Democrats message this.

Ben: Another practical argument is that this would focus attention on Trump’s efforts to undermine the election, which are likely to grow more and more intense. I think there’s a definite upside to that.

Jon: That would matter. I don’t see how impeachment prevents Trump from undermining the election, though.

Eric: Matt Yglesias mentioned this over the weekend, I think, but opposition parties in states ruled by corrupt/proto-authoritarian regimes often mobilize mass protests and civil disobedience to check the incumbents’ power. Not sure whether that would in fact be a means of imposing a cost on Trump’s lawlessness without jeopardizing incumbent Dems (not hard to imagine a case for why it’d do neither of those things). But I think it is worth considering mechanisms for resistance beyond those suggested by our shitty Constitution

Ben: Eric “Smash the State” Levitz.

Eric: Or at least the Trump-owned properties.

Jon: Impeachment is too radical; revolution is the answer. Seriously, though, protesting the Trump properties seems like a no-brainer. Why don’t people do that? Is there no space? (There is in D.C.!) I visited the Trump hotel there with my family last winter. I couldn’t understand why there aren’t crowds out there 24/7 screaming that the people inside are criminals.

Ben: At least give it a bad Yelp review.

Eric: Yeah, I feel like “Make it harder for Trump to profit off the presidency by protesting constantly outside his clearly marked profit centers” seems like a sound strategy.

Soros and Steyer can pay the protesters.

Jon: My friend once mistakenly walked into a place in Brooklyn and was looking at a group of obvious mobsters. One of them said, “You’re in the wrong place.” And he scooted. I felt like the Trump Hotel should be like that. It’s this notorious center of criminal activity. But you can just walk right in there. It’s weird.

Ben: All right, back to impeachment. To what extent do you think elevating this story might backfire for Democrats, or at least for Joe Biden? While there’s no hint of actual illegality in the Bidens’ involvement with Ukraine, it’s true that Joe’s son was being paid $50,000 a month by a sketchy oligarch for services that are unclear. It gives off the appearance of garden-variety influence peddling, which is not generally popular among voters.

Jon: It’s definitely true that every time Trump or his surrogates are asked about it, they respond with a soundbite attacking Biden, and the media carry those soundbites. So certainly it hurts Biden more than any other Democrat.

Eric: Yeah. And given that Warren has staked out a leadership position on impeachment while Biden has not, such a push could hurt him in more ways than one.

Ben: What about the substantive charges there, that Biden’s family shouldn’t have been involved with this stuff in the first place? Did he mess up in that regard?

Jon: Reportedly, Hunter took that job without ever consulting his father and/or Hunter is definitely a screwup, the Don Jr. of the Biden family, a ne’er-do-well who just trades on his dad’s name. The good news is that by all appearances, he is fooling clients into believing he has pull, of which there’s no evidence.

Ben: Do you think it’s inevitable that impeachment is going to happen at this point?

Jon: No, not at all. The clock is ticking, and once the campaign is underway I think it gets harder.

Ben: Of course we also don’t have the full details of what really happened on this phone call, etc.

Jon: Thursday’s hearing will be important.

Eric: Yeah, at this point, it’s not clear that the news cycle won’t digest this Ukraine thing in a week’s time. When and if the news moves on, I imagine the impeachment talk will lose momentum. Remember when the fact that Saudi Arabia openly killed a Washington Post columnist was supposed to somehow change our relationship with its government?

First, no question that has been asked before should be asked again. Moderators have run the Medicare-for-all vs. public option argument into the ground, yet neglected education, debt, Russia, the courts, jobs, Iran, civil rights and a slew of other topics.

Second, moderators should be able to turn candidates’ microphones on and off. No interruptions. No cross talk. No going wildly over time. Period. Let people talk and then enter an orderly queue for responses, comments, etc.

Third, the debates need fewer questions and longer answers, while also not running longer than two hours. (No normal viewer can handle much more than that.) Eliminate open and closing statements and do one topic per 30 minutes, for a total of four subjects. The candidates should be compelled to talk at length on major topics so we can assess what they think, how they reason and what they know. Imagine a debate with four questions only (with needed follow-ups):

AD

AD

What legal or constitutional changes do we need post-Trump to protect our democracy?

How would you increase American productivity?

What would be your policy toward Russia?

What, if anything would you do about the debt?

Longer segments are more likely to force the candidates off soundbites and require them to think more substantively about critical issues. Certainly, in the context of the debt, for example, entitlement programs and taxes could be addressed. In the productivity discussion everything from job training to infrastructure to K-12 education would be fair game.

Fourth, let the candidates ask some follow-up questions of one another. (Each one gets one question for one other candidate.) Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) could ask Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) why a store manager with no college degree should be paying taxes to subsidize wealthy kids’ college education. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could ask Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) how she will get rid of the filibuster when all Republican senators and several Democrats oppose such a move.

The debates have become Kabuki performances that do not assist voters to make informed decisions or candidates to demonstrate the depth of their knowledge and preparedness. They haven’t changed many voters’ minds because they are currently designed to create conflict, reward zingers and reinforce trite narratives. Frankly, as the debates are currently constituted, candidates should not have to spend this much time on these useless or even counterproductive exercises. If the DNC cannot figure out how to improve the debates, they should dump them.

UPDATE: The DNC announced its new criteria: 165,000 donors (including a minimum of 600 donors per state in at least 20 states) plus either 5 percent in two early state polls or 3 percent in four otherwise-approved polls. That should reduce the field. Now the DNC needs to fix the debate format.

While she has touted her education at Howard University and raised her experience being bused to school as a young girl, her presidential campaign has stressed universality and inclusion. Her “3 a.m. agenda"" has stressed that what keeps us up at night — medical bills, housing, our kids’ education — does not depend on whether one is a Republican or Democrat. She routinely states that “we have so much more in common than what separates us.”

That reticence, by necessity, has receded. Voters demand a level of candor and intimacy from their presidential candidates. To both define her message and defend her record, she has had to explain her tenure as a prosecutor and rebutted claims that she was a cog in the machine of mass incarceration. She’s been obliged to share stories of her experience as a prosecutor comforting mothers whose children have been shot and killed and in instituting anti-bias training for police officers.

AD

AD

Moreover, as the campaign has progressed, Harris has more overtly emphasized her connection to the African American community and posited herself as African Americans’ advocate in the halls of power. This was especially noticeable in her speech Saturday. She spoke of herself as standing on the shoulders of African American giants such as Thurgood Marshall and told the crowd, “We need soldiers in every phase, layer and trench of the movement for social justice.” There is a need to pair outside advocacy with the hard and “frustrating” work of insiders, she argued. To sustain change and promote progress, she said, “We must elect and lift up people to lead who are also immersed in our community, who represent us and our experience, and who know the deep flaws within the systems we serve.” She added, “We need to run into the fire … extinguisher in hand.” In short, it matters for black Americans to have black Americans in power, on the inside.

Who better to knock down “the systemic barriers to racism,” she posits, than someone who understands that system but also has a deep understanding of the challenges facing the African American community as only a member of that community can? We now see her make the explicit case that the outcomes she obtained — e.g., getting jobs for young, low-level drug offenders — were a reflection of her understanding and attachment to the African American community.

For Harris, the address marked a level of candor and earnestness about her identity as an accomplished, African American woman that we have not regularly seen on the trail. In a time of “overt racism,” she presented herself “as only the second black woman elected to the United States Senate and as a serious and top-tier candidate for the president of the United States.”

AD

AD

One can be cynical and say she is more vividly identifying as an African American candidate with an eye toward the critical South Carolina primary and the need to win over African American voters who heavily favor former vice president Joe Biden. However, it would be foolish for Harris to ignore her own identity, her own career and her own experience as she asks voters to take a chance on a first-time candidate for president, a woman still in her first term in the Senate.

All presidential candidates must personalize themselves. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) talks about her Okie upbringing on the “ragged edge” of the middle class. Biden is ""Middle-Class Joe,” and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is the gal from the heartland. Perhaps in fully inhabiting her role as an African American female trailblazer and a progressive insider, Harris’s will find the focus and clarity she needs.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin mounted an awkward defense of President Trump’s conduct in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

He dismissed as “speculation” reporting by The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal that Trump pressed his counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. The president later confirmed he raised the subject of the former vice president and Trump challenger in the call. (“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters.)

And Mnuchin said it was “inappropriate” that Biden’s son, Hunter, “did very significant business dealings in Ukraine” while his father was in office, laying out a standard that the Trump family is currently violating, as CNN's “State of the Union” host Jake Tapper pointed out during their interview.

Mnuchin’s advocacy for the president on controversies of all stripes carries real financial risk. He can move markets with his words: The dollar tanked last year when the secretary made some offhand comments that a weak dollar would benefit trade. In the event of an economic crisis, Mnuchin could be called on to reassure the public. His ability to do so would rest on his credibility.

This isn't the first time Mnuchin has advanced controversial arguments in defense of his boss. He was notably outspoken, for example, amid the furor over Trump’s “both sides” comments after the violence in Charlottesville two years ago. At the time, Mnuchin waved off a pressure campaign urging him to resign, including 300 members of his Yale college class. The performance earned him a stinging rebuke from one of his predecessors:

Steven Mnuchin may be the greatest sycophant in Cabinet history. — Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) September 24, 2017

That unblinking loyalty — Mnuchin once said Trump has “perfect genes” — helps explain the Treasury secretary's relative longevity in the Trump administration. Of 16 Cabinet-level positions, only seven officials, including Mnuchin, survive from the president’s original lineup. One of the alums from that roster, former defense secretary Jim Mattis, demonstrated a path easier taken by ex-officials. “This is not something I have background on,” Mattis told ABC’s Martha Raddatz on “This Week,” declining to discuss the matter. Or he could acknowledge the obvious: It would be wrong for the president to pressure a foreign leader to probe a domestic political opponent.

Mnuchin, on the other hand, offered a more aggressive defense of the president than some other Trump surrogates. Whereas Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also appearing on ABC, suggested “it wouldn’t be appropriate” for the White House to release the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, the Treasury secretary went further. He said it would “set a terrible precedent” because “conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.” And if the administration hands it over to Congress, it probably would leak, Mnuchin said.

Trump later in the day told reporters he was considering whether to do so.

MARKET MOVERS

— German economy edges toward recession. WSJ's Paul Hannon: ""Germany’s economy is on the brink of recession, according to a survey of purchasing managers that recorded the sharpest fall in business activity in almost seven years during September, reflecting the deepening hit to factories from the U.S.’s trade war with China and uncertainty around the U.K.’s departure from the European Union.

""The downturn in Europe’s largest economy has been led by its manufacturing sector, which is heavily dependent on exports and has been hit by weakening demand from the U.K., China, Turkey and elsewhere over the past year. But in September the sector experienced an even sharper contraction, as its Purchasing Managers Index slumped to 41.4 from 43.5 in August, hitting its lowest level in more than a decade. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity.""

— Trump's Fed tweets move markets. Bloomberg's Simon Kennedy: ""Trump’s Twitter attacks on the Federal Reserve are prompting investors to bet the central bank will bow to political pressure and lower interest rates, according to a new study. Trump has frequently used social media to criticize the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell for running rates higher than he thinks they should be. A review of such tweets and the market response by economists from Duke University and the London Business School found they have a “statistically significant and negative effect” on markets. The broadsides knocked a combined 10 basis points off the expected fed funds futures contract, the equivalent to about 0.30 basis points per Tweet, the study found.""

— Chinese negotiators cut trip short. CNBC's Yun Li: ""Chinese trade negotiators had a sudden change of plans Friday, canceling a visit to meet U.S. farmers after they wrapped up trade talks in Washington this week. The Chinese delegation has changed its travel schedule and is headed back to China earlier than planned, according to Nicole Rolf, the Montana Farm Bureau Federation’s director of national affairs. There was no explanation as to why they were cutting their trip short, Rolf said.

""Nebraska department of agriculture also said the Chinese officials called off a visit to farms in Nebraska. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue confirmed just Thursday the meetings were in the works as a way for China to build goodwill with American farmers.""

— Trump names China hawk as deputy national security advisor. WSJ's Vivian Salama: ""Trump has chosen one of his leading policy counselors on China and North Korea as his new deputy national security adviser, according to an administration official. Matt Pottinger, who served in the Marines and worked earlier in his career as a China-based correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, will be the No. 2 to Robert O’Brien, who was named as Mr. Trump’s fourth national security adviser earlier this week. The administration official said that Vice President Mike Pence had been advocating for Mr. Pottinger in recent days given his work on some of the biggest policy challenges facing the Trump administration.""

DOJ warns about Chinese IP theft. CNBC's Nancy Hungerford: ""The Department of Justice has a warning for companies: Bolster your defenses. 'More cases are being opened that implicate trade secret theft' — and more of them point to China, said U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey. Since 2012, more than 80% of economic espionage cases brought by the department’s National Security Division have implicated China. The frequency of cases has been rising in recent years, according to Hickey.""

— Adelson reportedly warns Trump about trade war: “[Trump’s] sudden escalation of the trade war with China last month triggered a telephone call from billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who warned the president about the conflict’s impact on the U.S. economy and Mr. Trump’s re-election prospects, according to people familiar with the call,” the Wall Street Journal’s Alex Leary, William Mauldin and Kate O’Keeffe report.

“During his call with Mr. Trump, Mr. Adelson focused on the broader implications of the U.S.-China trade war and their potential political consequences for Mr. Trump, according to one of the people, and not on his own company’s situation. Representatives for Mr. Adelson, a major donor to the Republican Party, have also spoken with members of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, according to this person.”

— One company has filed more than 10,000 tariff waivers: “U.S. companies have filed more than 16,000 requests for exemptions from the $200 billion tranche of tariffs on Chinese goods that the Trump administration imposed one year ago. Of those appeals, over 10,000 have come from just one company: Arrowhead Engineered Products Inc. of Blaine, Minn.,” WSJ’s Josh Zumbrun, Anthony DeBarros and Chad Day report.

“Companies have taken different approaches to the exclusion process. Some have filed only for a few key items. Others have filed single applications that cover many products, especially if those items all fall under the same 10-digit code in the tariff schedule. Trade attorneys and experts have said it isn’t clear which tack is more effective.”

— Pressure mounts on WeWork’s CEO: “ The knives are out for WeWork CEO Adam Neumann,” Bloomberg News’s Gillian Tan, Sarah McBride, and Michelle Davis report.

“With the drama of a palace coup, some directors are considering a plan to encourage the brash co-founder of the once high-flying real estate startup to step down as chief executive, according to people familiar with the situation. Among them: Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., WeWork’s biggest investor, a person said.”

A board meeting is scheduled for this morning: “ … In what would be a remarkable showdown between the 40-year-old Neumann and his billionaire backer. The directors are said to be considering asking him to become non-executive chairman.”

— Big companies set emissions goals before U.N. summit: “We Mean Business,” a coalition of advocacy groups, said dozens of companies had joined the initiative in the two months leading up to a United Nations summit taking place ... which aims to spur faster action on climate change,” Reuters’s Matthew Green reports. “We Mean Business said 87 companies are now involved, with total market capitalization of more than $2.3 trillion.”

“Some companies in the coalition have agreed to slash their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, including Swiss food company Nestle, French building materials company Saint-Gobain, and French cosmetics maker L’Oreal. This group includes Finnish telecoms company Nokia, French food group Danone and British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, We Mean Business said.”

— Big week ahead for Fannie, Freddie: “Mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expected to start keeping their earnings as early as this week, pausing a yearslong arrangement in which they handed nearly all of their profits to the Treasury Department,” WSJ’s Andrew Ackerman reports.

“The move, in an expected agreement between the Trump administration and their federal regulator, would be an initial major step in allowing the companies to build up capital so they can operate as private companies again. Under the forthcoming agreement, the companies would be allowed to retain about a year’s worth of profits, or about $20 billion, Mark Calabria, the Federal Housing Finance Agency chief, said in an interview after touring a senior center financed in part by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.”

It’s also a key week for the future of Boeing’s 737 Max: “With a crucial summit for the Boeing Co. 737 Max looming this week, regulators are downplaying the threat of a rupture to a decades-old working relationship between U.S. and European aviation authorities,” Bloomberg News’s Julie Johnsson and Alan Levin report.

“On the eve of a gathering of about 50 airworthiness experts in Montreal, the top European regulator, Patrick Ky, suggested that the Max could return to the air in the U.S. and Europe at almost the same time. And officials privately have been discussing whether a critical disagreement over the jet’s architecture could be resolved after it resumes commercial flight, according to people familiar with the talks.”

SCHIFF: Well, Jake, you know I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment, for the reason that I think the founders contemplating, in a country that has elections every four years, that this would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort, not first resort.

But if the president is essentially withholding military aid, at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, that is, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.

We’re going to hear from the director of national intelligence on Thursday why he is the first director to withhold ever a whistleblower complaint. And we are going to make sure that we get that complaint, that whistleblower is protected.

And we're going to make sure that we find out whether the president has engaged in this kind of improper conduct. But it may be that we do have to move forward with that extraordinary remedy, if indeed the president is, at the same time withholding vital military assistance, he is trying to leverage that to obtain impermissible help in his political campaign.

Perhaps because it’s become unsurprising, or maybe because it’s easier to write about clamoring from the left than deflection by the right, far less attention is being paid to the apparent acquiescence of congressional Republicans.

The donnybrook has emerged as the latest test of a famous Trump boast during the 2016 campaign. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn’t lose any voters,” he said.

Each scandal seems to bring a more restrained reaction from GOP leaders. The outcries after Charlottesville and child separation seem like eons ago. Most Republicans went radio silent as new details emerged about Trump using the power of the presidency in an alleged attempt to collude with a foreign power for partisan purposes.

The only prominent elected Republican to speak out this weekend was Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 standard-bearer. And he was measured. “If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” Romney tweeted on Sunday. “Critical for the facts to come out.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, during a single call, the president urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “about eight times” to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on a probe that could hamper Biden’s 2020 campaign. That call took place just one day after Bob Mueller testified on Capitol Hill about his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and Trump’s efforts to hinder that investigation. It came a month after Trump said he would accept help from another country for his 2020 reelection campaign if it was offered. “There’s nothing wrong with listening,” he told ABC News.

On Sunday morning, Trump appeared to say that he brought up Biden with Zelensky. “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House. A few hours later in Houston, the president said he didn’t want to talk about it. “But certainly I’d have the right to,” he added.

Speaking to reporters, Trump also slammed the former vice president for saying that he never spoke with his son about his business dealings in Ukraine. The president said that’s implausible. “He said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Does anybody believe that one?”

For his part, the president has insisted that he never spoke to his son Don Jr. in advance about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that was set up after a Russian lawyer allegedly offered to provide his campaign with dirt on Hillary Clinton. In the Mueller report, the president’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he recalled being in Trump’s office when the son talked about a meeting to get “adverse information” on Clinton. Cohen told Mueller’s team that it appeared that father and son had previously discussed the subject. Mueller never interviewed Trump or Trump Jr.

A year later, in June 2017, the president personally dictated the statement in which his son claimed that the Trump Tower meeting a year before was “primarily” about “the adoption of Russian children.” Emails disclosed a few days later showed clearly that was not why Don Jr. agreed to the meeting.

-- With this do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do presidency, it’s more important to watch what Trump does than what he says. The president also claimed on Sunday, for example, that he would “love” to release the transcript of his call. This soundbite played prominently in many news accounts, but it doesn’t pass the smell test. If the transcript vindicated him, Trump could – and almost certainly would – release it. But the White House has played an active role in preventing acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire from complying with congressional demands for the material in the underlying whistleblower complaint, which the law says should be turned over.

“White House counsel Pat Cipollone has been engaged in the matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, officials said, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump,” Matt Zapotosky, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig reported on Friday. “The issue has become a source of tension between the White House and the office of the DNI, with Maguire forced into the position of fending off lawmakers’ demands — citing jurisdictional objections — while the White House avoids asserting executive privilege or taking a clear legal position.”

-- Trump’s surrogates on the Sunday shows made clear that the transcript won’t be forthcoming, at least not without a fight. “Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn’t be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on ABC. “There’s no evidence that that would be appropriate here at this point.”

“I think it would be highly inappropriate to release a transcript of a call between two world leaders,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on NBC, adding that foreign governments “expect that they are kept confidential.”

One factor in John Bolton’s recent ouster as national security adviser was reportedly his unwillingness to blindly defend Trump on the Sunday shows, particularly the president’s desire to invite the Taliban to Camp David on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary. Mnuchin and Pompeo appear to have no such qualms.

After Mnuchin criticized Hunter Biden for doing business in Ukraine, he got mealy-mouthed when CNN’s Jake Tapper asked if that means he thinks it’s not okay for Don Jr. and Eric Trump to do business all over the world and for Ivanka Trump to get copyrights approved by foreign governments. “I don’t really want to go into more of these details,” Mnuchin protested.

-- With an election year approaching, many top Republicans on Capitol Hill quickly circled the wagons. Borrowing from the Roy Cohn playbook, they tried to play offense. “The president and his close allies also escalated their attacks on Biden on Sunday, demanding probes into the former vice president and his son’s work in Ukraine, though no evidence has surfaced that Biden acted inappropriately and Trump’s allies did not provide any,” Seung Min Kim and Felicia Sonmez report. “Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called for the Justice Department to play a role in the matter, arguing that it should ‘look at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,’ in a reference to Mueller’s Russia probe. … On Sunday, Giuliani attacked Joe Biden in deeply personal terms by referencing Hunter Biden’s struggles with addiction. ‘The kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict,’ Giuliani said on ‘Fox News Sunday.’” (Our fact checker team this morning challenges the latest claims by Trump and his team about Biden and Ukraine.)

-- Meanwhile, several Republicans who are uncomfortable with Trump are quietly leaving office rather than drawing his ire by speaking out. Rachael Bade has a deep dive in today’s newspaper on the 18 House GOP retirements. The most poignant example is Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.): “Moments after Trump’s July 14 missive telling four U.S. congresswomen of color to ‘go back’ to their countries of origin, the congressman from Michigan phoned a fellow House GOP leader and asked him to get Trump to stop. … Three days later, Mitchell was awaiting a prime-time CNN appearance when he saw footage of Trump rallygoers chanting ‘send her back,’ aimed at one of the congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Stunned, Mitchell said he scribbled question marks on a notepad to silently ask an aide: ‘How do I even respond to this on TV?’ But one of the final straws was the unwillingness of people in Trump’s orbit to listen.

“Mitchell implored Vice President Pence, his chief of staff, Marc Short, and ‘any human being that has any influence in the White House’ to arrange a one-on-one conversation between him and the president so he could express his concerns. It never happened. And 10 days after the Trump tweet, Mitchell — a two-term lawmaker who thought he’d be in Congress for years to come — announced his retirement. ‘We’re here for a purpose — and it’s not this petty, childish b------t,’ Mitchell, 62, said in an interview …

“Since Trump’s inauguration, a Washington Post analysis shows, nearly 40 percent of the 241 Republicans who were in office in January 2017 are gone or leaving … The vast turnover is a reminder of just how much Trump has remade the GOP — and of the purge of those who dare to oppose him. … All told, 41 House Republicans have left national politics or announced they won’t seek reelection in the nearly three years since Trump took office. That dwarfs the 25 Democrats who retired in the first four years of former president Barack Obama’s tenure — and Republicans privately predict this is only the beginning. Most of the departing Republicans publicly cite family as the reason for leaving. But behind the scenes, Republicans say the trend highlights a greater pessimism about the direction of the party under Trump — and their ability to win back the House next year. …

“One Republican aide close to Rep. Martha Roby … said the Alabamian decided to retire in part because she was tired of pretending she backed Trump. … A former House Republican close with Rep. Susan Brooks said she also has struggled with Trump’s tone, though the Indiana Republican pushed back on the suggestion that frustration with Trump was the reason for her retirement. … Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said Trump’s tweets are ‘more divisive’ than he would like, but the former Natural Resources Committee chairman said he’s leaving because … [he] is term-limited on the panel. Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), another retiring member, declined to say whether he had any problems with Trump. … ‘If the party doesn’t start looking like America, there will not be a party in America,’ said Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), the only black House Republican, who announced his retirement in August.”

-- Most Republicans, however, are choosing to just stay quiet and keep their heads down. “You might think that Republicans who have made national security their calling card since the Reagan era might finally hit the limits of their cravenness in the face of a whistleblower’s bravery. But the party, our politics and our media system are too broken for the old norms to apply,” writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

“Even Republican politicians who know how dangerous this situation is thus prefer to stay in their bunkers and hope to survive,” he adds in his column for today’s newspaper. “The GOP’s electorate is dominated by Trump’s supporters. Staying mum provides protection from opponents inside their own party — and from their own voters. And if they broke ranks, Trump’s media allies would attack them viciously. By playing for time, these taciturn Republicans will be able to tell us once Trump is gone how they knew all along just how bad he was. But when the greatest threat to our country is the corruption of our constitutional system, might at least some of the GOP’s leading politicians decide that there are worse things than losing a primary, or being upbraided by Fox News?”

-- Trump seems to be daring House Democrats to impeach him, and they seem increasingly inclined to take up the challenge. “We very well may have crossed the Rubicon here,” said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment,” he explained on CNN. “But if the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents. … We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. If there’s a fire burning, it needs to be put out, and that's why we’re going to have to look at every remedy. … We're going to have to consider impeachment … as a remedy here.”

-- This is a striking quote because Schiff, an ally of Nancy Pelosi, really has been heretofore cautious. The speaker herself sent a letter to all her House colleagues warning that the acting director of national intelligence must turn over the whistleblower complaint detailing Trump’s interactions with Ukraine. “If the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” she wrote.

-- This letter, while avoiding the I-word, should be a read as a shot across the bow of the White House, and it’s a reflection of the bubbling-over frustration that Pelosi has been hearing from many of her members. “She and Schiff were in touch throughout the weekend, syncing up strategies and talking points,” Bade and Josh Dawsey report. “An increasingly vocal group of pro-impeachment House Democrats are starting to dismiss their own oversight of Trump as feckless, even accusing their colleagues of emboldening the president by refusing to stand up to what they see as lawless behavior. …

“With Pelosi unwilling to impeach Trump, Democratic rank-and-file members are frantically looking for something to fortify their investigations. On Friday, Judiciary members pressed [committee chairman Jerry Nadler] to invoke Congress’s long-dormant inherent contempt authority that would allow Congress to jail or fine people for defying subpoenas, an idea he supports … The power hasn’t been used in nearly 100 years. Pelosi, leadership and other House lawyers were dismissive of the idea when investigators first floated it in the spring. But Judiciary members are once again trying to force the issue and are planning to make the matter a big focus of the coming week.”

A notable quote from their story: “Our side says it’s ‘legally questionable,’ ‘it hasn’t been used in forever,’ and ‘blah, blah, blah,’ ” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a member of the panel, who argues Trump’s legal team frequently has used last-ditch efforts and bogus explanations to block testimony — and the House should do the same. “I say do it. Let them argue in court that they take the position that it’s legally questionable. We back off of everything! We’ve been very weak.”

-- A founding member of the Squad, who has supported impeachment, said this weekend that it’s become scandalous that Democrats won’t try to impeach Trump:

At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him.



The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it.



The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

-- “Several first-term lawmakers who had opposed impeachment conferred privately over the weekend to discuss announcing support for an inquiry, potentially jointly, after a hearing scheduled for Thursday with the acting national intelligence director,” per the New York Times. “A handful of them declined to speak on the record over the weekend, with some still reluctant to go public and others looking for cues from Ms. Pelosi and their freshman colleagues. … Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said once a transcript is made public of Mr. Trump pressuring Mr. Zelensky, she doubted that even Democrats from competitive seats could continue to resist impeachment.”

-- The whistleblower story is likely to dominate the news again this week. Trump arrived in New York last night for the United Nations General Assembly, where he is scheduled to meet with Zelensky – the Ukrainian leader – on Wednesday. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify publicly on Thursday before Schiff’s committee.

-- Conservatives who don’t hold elected office have been far more willing to criticize Trump. “We don’t yet know the full details because of White House stonewalling, but from what we already know, this may be the most shocking revelation of wrongdoing by Trump since he fired FBI Director James B. Comey on May 9, 2017, (by his own admission) to squelch the investigation of his Russia ties,” writes columnist Max Boot, a leading Trump critic on the right. “If there were any justice in the world, this would mark a turning point where Democrats find the courage to impeach and Republicans find the decency to stop defending the indefensible. Instead, so far we are getting a rerun of previous scandals characterized by Trump’s brazenness, Republicans’ servility and Democrats’ pusillanimity.”

2020 WATCH:

-- A major milestone: The Des Moines Register's poll, released Saturday night, showed Elizabeth Warren edging out Biden in Iowa. The survey is within the margin of error, but marks the first time the former vice president hasn't been on top in such a respected early-state poll. The Register breaks down the results of the survey, which it conducted with CNN: “Warren’s slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator’s many plans and policies, Iowa experts say. … Twenty-two percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers say Warren is their first choice for president, compared with 20% for Biden and 11% for [Bernie Sanders]. No other candidate reaches double digits. It’s the first major shakeup in the polling standings, said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. ... Lara Henderson, who was state director for U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s now-ended Iowa caucus campaign, said that while other candidates have had viral moments or quick bursts of national attention, Warren’s team has excelled at capturing those moments and turning them into on-the-ground support.""

“ The poll also revealed some vulnerabilities for Warren: Her supporters are not completely locked in. According to the poll, just 12% of Warren’s backers say they are fully committed to caucusing for her, and 88% say they could still be persuaded to support someone else.""

According to the poll, just 12% of Warren’s backers say they are fully committed to caucusing for her, and 88% say they could still be persuaded to support someone else."" “ Biden has fallen from 32% last December to 20% today. In that time, his favorability rating also has fallen: 82% of likely Democratic caucusgoers had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%. …

In that time, his favorability rating also has fallen: 82% of likely Democratic caucusgoers had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%. … “The portion of likely Democratic caucusgoers who say [Pete Buttigieg] is their first choice for president has dropped by 6 percentage points since the June poll , from 15% to 9%.""

, from 15% to 9%."" “Sanders, too, has stumbled, falling from a high of 25% in March to 11% today. Even among those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016, 25% say they will do so again. He loses 32% of his 2016 supporters to Warren and 12% to Buttigieg.”

-- The Register poll underscores how much of a problem Warren is for Sanders. Sean Sullivan, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Chelsea Janes report: “She is winning a bigger share of people who caucused for Sanders in 2016 than he is, and she is outpacing him among those under 35, his former strong suit, according to the survey … Sanders campaign officials, dismissing the notion that their candidate is struggling, vowed Sunday to plow ahead with aggressive moves to win the Iowa caucuses. … Sanders will embark Monday on a ‘Bernie Beats Trump’ tour across the state, an effort to argue that he is the most electable choice against President Trump in 2020. But his more immediate obstacle is Warren, whom he has refrained from criticizing, though some of his surrogates have been more aggressive.""

-- An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found a record share of voters both personally dislike Trump and harbor doubts about some of the liberal policies backed by Sanders and Warren. Biden also faces questions about his fitness for the job. From NBC News: “A record 50 percent say they dislike [Trump] personally and dislike his policies, while another 19 percent say that they dislike him but approve of his policies. … Half of voters — 49 percent — say they’re very uncomfortable with his 2020 candidacy. That’s compared to 41 percent who say the same for Sanders and 33 percent apiece who say the same for Biden or Warren. … Among Democratic primary voters, 64 percent say they support providing government health care to undocumented immigrants, while just 36 percent of all registered voters agree. A similar share of Democratic voters — 63 percent — support a single payer ‘Medicare-for-All’ style plan, also backed by Warren and Sanders, that would replace the existing private insurance system. Among voters overall, just 41 percent support that idea.”

-- Cory Booker’s campaign made a stark announcement on Saturday: He needs to bring in $1.7 million in 10 days, his campaign manager Addisu Demissie said, or else he will probably drop out. Without that haul before the end of the third fundraising quarter, Demissie wrote in a memo, “we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.” BuzzFeed News reports: “The decision to state this publicly — framed by Booker campaign officials as a show of ‘radical transparency,’ an honest, vulnerable ‘call for help’ when most campaigns just project strength all the time, even falsely — came both suddenly, as a shock, and slowly, as an inevitable fact. Booker, the 50-year-old New Jersey senator and former Newark mayor, talks with confidence about his team’s ‘slow and steady’ approach to the Democratic primary. It’s ‘tortoise and the hare,’ his aides say. ... There’s a sense, watching Booker’s campaign, that their strategy is also incumbent upon a moment — a fact that can create some dissonance between his public confidence and the reality that, almost eight months into his presidential bid, that moment has yet to arrive.”

-- A few Democratic candidates hastily arranged visits to picket lines for the United Auto Workers. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “On Thursday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told Detroit autoworkers they should be rewarded for making concessions ‘when this company was in some bad straits.’ On Sunday, Biden spoke to a local union in Kansas City, Kan., and [Warren] picketed with workers in Detroit. Sanders plans to visit in coming days.""

-- The Alaska GOP canceled its 2020 Republican presidential primary, joining Nevada, South Carolina and Kansas. (Time)

-- Trump’s campaign team is increasingly grim about his ability to carry Michigan again in 2020. Politico’s Alex Isenstadt reports from a GOP confab on Mackinac Island: “After a midterm election that decimated the ranks of Michigan Republicans, Trump's campaign is looking to other battlegrounds he lost last time — such as Minnesota and New Hampshire — that they see as more promising. … Republican officials say they're planning a substantial investment in Michigan, with 20 full-time staffers expected to be deployed to the state by the end of the year.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- India’s Narendra Modi lavished praise on his American counterpart as the leaders of the world’s two largest democracies took the stage together in Houston before a roaring crowd of tens of thousands of Indian Americans. Philip Rucker reports: “Trump swooped into Houston on Sunday with an unusual role: as a warm-up act. Called ‘Howdy, Modi!,’ the event was staged to honor the prime minister and was billed as the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader other than the pope … ‘His name is familiar to every person on the planet,’ Modi said as he introduced Trump. … The prime minister then repurposed his own campaign slogan in India to rally support for ‘my friend’ Trump in the United States: ‘Abki baar, Trump sarkar,’ meaning, ‘This time, a Trump government.’ …

“The two strode onto the stage holding hands. … Trump delivered remarks — and, unlike at his own campaign rallies, did not appear to stray from his script on Teleprompters. The president highlighted his stewardship of the economy, but drew far most impassioned responses from the crowd when he talked about other issues. The president received a standing ovation when he denounced ‘radical Islamic terrorism,’ and sustained applause when he vowed to stop illegal immigration. … Trump made a direct pitch to expand his share of support among Indian Americans in his 2020 reelection.""

-- As her first General Assembly begins, Trump’s new U.N. ambassador, Kelly Craft, faces crises from climate change and North Korea’s missile launches to Venezuela’s hunger crisis and a potential conflict with Iran. Carol Morello reports: “Craft is up to the task, her allies say. … ‘Looking ahead, I plan to remind the other nations of the U.N. that the United States isn’t going anywhere,’ [Craft said]. ‘As we demand more of the U.N., and more equitable burden-sharing among members, we will also continue to press for real action to advance human rights, women’s empowerment, health and wellbeing, etc.’”

-- Trump likely faces an uphill battle in mobilizing international pressure against Iran at the U.N. assembly. From the Journal: “A senior administration official said the U.S. plans to make Iran’s ‘exploratory violence’ a theme of this week’s U.N. General Assembly, following Iran’s alleged strike on the Saudi energy facilities. … Western diplomats, however, said they have been given no indication yet that the U.S. intends to push for action by the U.N. Security Council, which has the authority to impose sanctions and authorize military action. At the U.N., the process developing resolutions capable of winning support on the 15-member council can take weeks. … In a further complication for U.S. diplomatic efforts, Russia is leading the Security Council in September, and Russia and China have veto authority in the body. Neither is considered likely to favor biting economic measures, let alone concerted military action.”

-- The United Kingdom has concluded that Iran is responsible for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities. From the AP: Prime Minister Boris Johnson “said the U.K. would consider taking part in a U.S.-led military effort to bolster the Gulf kingdom’s defenses. ... [But] the Conservative prime minister also said the U.K. would work with allies to ‘de-escalate’ Middle East tensions that have soared since the Sept. 14 attack on the world’s largest oil processor and an oil field. Britain had previously held back from attributing blame for the drone and missile attack. Saudi Arabia and the United States say Iran was responsible.”

-- Johnson said Brits shouldn’t get their hopes up for a “New York breakthrough” on Brexit. From Politico Europe: “Speaking on his RAF Voyager plane as he flew into New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, the U.K. prime minister insisted that despite the downbeat assessment, he is not ‘getting pessimistic.’ He said his overall hopes for a deal remain ‘cautiously optimistic.’ … Johnson said there are ‘clearly still gaps and still difficulties’ in the negotiations but that he still holds out hope a deal could be secured by October 31, when the U.K. is meant to leave the bloc.”

-- An alliance of Arab Israeli parties threw its support behind Benjamin Netanyahu’s rival, Benny Gantz, to lead Israel. Ruth Eglash reports: “In a historic move, an alliance of Arab Israeli parties recommended a prime ministerial candidate to President Reuven Rivlin for the first time in almost three decades … Arab parties traditionally refrain from recommending a candidate during consultations as an ideological protest of Israel’s ongoing military occupation of the Palestinians. The last time an Arab party backed a candidate during consultations was in 1992, when Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister. Rabin later signed the historic Oslo accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.”

-- Hong Kong protesters are targeting Beijing-friendly businesses in their latest demonstrations. Timothy McLaughlin and Casey Quackenbush report: “The new tactic showed a simmering anger toward the city’s business elites, a relatively small group of tycoons and cronies who have accumulated enormous wealth and political clout, often through cozy relationships with the mainland. … Hundreds of protesters gathered at New Town Plaza, a multistory shopping mall in the Sha Tin district. They targeted Chinese-linked businesses such as Maxim’s Jade Garden restaurant, flooding the automated reservation system with requests and taping the receipts together to create an ad hoc protest banner. … By evening, in what has been a recurring pattern in the weekend protests, demonstrations that began peacefully turned violent.”

-- The protests are threatening to rain on China’s anniversary parade. Anna Fifield reports: “The Communist Party is ready to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1 with the kind of military extravaganza that only Stalinist states can pull off. It ought to be a particularly sweet anniversary for China’s leaders: Their Communist state has now lasted longer than the Soviet Union, which endured for 69 years. But it is not. The months-long standoff between the party and the millions who have been protesting in Hong Kong is set to come to a head on Oct. 1, when the demonstrators plan to stage a counter-rally. ‘A confrontation of monumental proportions is coming up,’ said Orville Schell, a China specialist at the Asia Society. ‘Clearly, something will happen on Oct. 1.’”

-- Indonesian investigators determined that design and oversight lapses played a central role in the fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max jet last year. From the Wall Street Journal: “The draft conclusions ... also identify a string of pilot errors and maintenance mistakes as causal factors in the fatal plunge of the Boeing Co. plane into the Java Sea, echoing a preliminary report from Indonesia last year. … Details of the Indonesian report ... are subject to change and further analysis. Indonesian investigators declined to comment, except to say the final document is likely to come out in early November. … U.S. air-crash investigators are preparing to make public a handful of separate safety recommendations, ranging from bolstering the manual flying skills of pilots to enhancing FAA vetting of new aircraft designs.”

-- The World Health Organization accused Tanzania of withholding information about suspected Ebola cases. Max Bearak reports: “The U.N. agency’s statement Saturday was its most pointed rebuke toward any government yet during the outbreak that has ravaged nearby eastern Congo for more than a year, killing more than 2,000 people. The WHO was made aware of the suspected cases in Tanzania shortly after one appeared this month in Dar es Salaam, the East African country’s largest city and former capital. After that, the international organization was shut out of blood sample testing and told by the government that Ebola had been ruled out, it said. Tanzanian authorities have not offered alternative diagnoses.”

-- Italy will take in migrants from the Ocean Viking rescue ship. More than a hundred migrants rescued by aid organizations SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders will be allowed to disembark in Italy, making it the second time this month that the European country has allowed the NGO permission to dock.

Don Brink, a semi-retired pig farmer, picks up students on his school bus route in Worthington, Minn. (Courtney Perry for the Washington Post)

DIVIDED AMERICA:

-- If you read only one story today, make it this: “Immigrant kids fill this town’s schools. Their bus driver is leading the backlash,” by Michael Miller in Worthington, Minn.: “It was the first day of school, so Don Brink was behind the wheel of his bus, its yellow paint glistening in the drizzling dawn. Wearing jeans and a John Deere cap, he turned the radio to an oldies station and, with hands callused thick by 50 years of farming, steered the vehicle toward the edge of town. He stopped in front of familiar farmhouses surrounded by fields of soy and corn, where blond children boarded the bus, chatting in English. ‘Morning,’ the 71-year-old Vietnam veteran said. This was the Worthington he knew.

“But then Brink headed back into town, past the meatpacking plant that was the area’s main employer and into the neighborhood he called Little Mexico, even though most of its residents were Central American. This was the Worthington he did not know — the Worthington he resented. … Brink said nothing. ‘I say ‘good morning’ to the kids who’ll respond to me,’ he said later. ‘But this year there are a lot of strange kids I’ve never seen before.’ Those children, some of whom crossed the U.S.-Mexico border alone, have fueled a bitter debate about immigration in Worthington, a community of 13,000 that has received more unaccompanied minors per capita than almost anywhere in the country…

“Five times in just over five years, the district has asked residents to approve an expansion of its schools to handle the surge in enrollment. Five times, the voters have refused — the last time by a margin of just 17 votes. A sixth referendum is scheduled for November. The divide can be felt all over Worthington, where ‘Minnesota nice’ has devolved into ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ window signs, boycotts on businesses and next-door neighbors who no longer speak. A Catholic priest who praised immigrants was booed from the pews and has received death threats. The driving force behind the defeats has been a handful of white farmers in this Trump-supporting county, including Brink, the bus driver. Even as he earns a paycheck ferrying undocumented children to and from school, Brink opposes the immigration system that allowed them to come to Worthington. ...

“In 2013, when the school district first asked voters to pay for new classrooms amid the influx of unaccompanied minors, those farmers feared they would bear the brunt of the $39 million. The bond referendum failed Three years later, when the school district asked for $79 million, some locals felt insulted … Attitudes have only hardened since then ... Accusations of racism have become commonplace. … ‘On a weekly basis I’m told I hate children,’ said [David] Bosma, 37, whose kids go to a private Christian school. ‘I’m just a young guy trying to make a living for myself and put food on the table for my family. I look at the bank account at end of the month and say, can I afford another $200 in property taxes this year?’ Brink also insists he isn’t prejudiced. His own grandparents were immigrants from Holland, and his parents spoke some Dutch. But he doesn’t believe Worthington should be a destination for the undocumented. ‘I wish they would have another ICE raid,’ he said. ‘They need to get rid of the illegals.’”

-- Farmers caught in the crossfire of Trump’s trade wars have grown increasingly dependent on the billions in federal handouts. “At $28 billion so far, the farm rescue is more than twice as expensive as the 2009 bailout of Detroit’s Big Three automakers, which cost taxpayers $12 billion,"" per Bloomberg News. ""And farmers expect the money to keep flowing: In an August survey by Purdue University and the CME Group, 58% said they anticipate another round of trade aid next year. … For American producers, the hit to exports has further strained finances that are at a breaking point because of a six-year slump in prices for agricultural commodities. Net farm income is projected to be down 29% this year from 2013 levels, and debt to total $416 billion. … The bailout funds won’t cover all of farmers’ losses. Producers in Iowa received $973 million in direct payments from the first round of trade aid covering a period in which Iowa State University estimated the trade war cost them $1.7 billion.”

-- Despite growing up in a gun-toting family and representing a rural swath of Virginia, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is all-in on gun control. It's a sign of how the times are changing. Jenna Portnoy reports: “The freshman congresswoman is backing a raft of gun-control measures, and not only those with bipartisan support, such as universal background checks and 'red flag' laws that would temporarily take guns from people deemed to be dangerous. She also wants to ban military-style weapons. A Democrat who unseated Republican Dave Brat in the suburbs outside Richmond last year, Spanberger is unabashed in her position on guns, which she says is largely in sync with the voters in her conservative district. … Constituents have been calling offices in tears begging for action, she said. ‘This is just grossly political, and people are dying because of it,’ she said. ‘The Senate is willing to not uphold the will of the American people, and it’s all political. It’s shameful.’”

-- Vice President Pence drove through Michigan’s Mackinac Island this weekend in an eight-vehicle motorcade, the first ever on the island. When Gerald Ford visited for a working vacation in July 1975, the sitting president traveled by carriage to the Grand Hotel. Some locals were unsettled by Pence's break with tradition, Gillian Brockell reports: “Motorized vehicles have been banned there since 1898, after carriage drivers complained the sound of ‘horseless carriages’ would scare their horses. There are some exceptions: Emergency vehicles are always allowed, and construction vehicles can motor on the island with a permit. Motorized wheelchairs are permitted in accordance with the American Disabilities Act.""

-- Climate activists plan to block streets throughout D.C. today to draw attention to climate change. Hannah Natanson reports: “The protest is timed to coincide with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, at which climate activists and leaders, including 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, are slated to speak. It follows a strike across six continents Friday and a youth conference at the United Nations on Saturday.

-- Local jurisdictions are experimenting with new ways to deal with Confederate monuments: Placing explanatory panels on or next to the statues detailing the history behind them. Natanson reports: “‘This monument should no longer stand as a memorial to white brotherhood,’ reads a sign erected this summer alongside a Confederate statue in Georgia. ‘This monument … fostered a culture of segregation by implying that public spaces and public memory belonged to whites,’ reads another. Declares a third: ‘This ignores the segregation and disenfranchisement of African Americans.’ … Proponents of installing explanatory markers say that — especially in states where removal is illegal — the tactic is realistic, inexpensive and swiftly achievable. Some go further, arguing that the signs are the best tactic, period.”

-- An Orlando, Fla., police officer arrested a 6-year-old after she threw a tantrum in class. Allyson Chiu reports: “Meralyn Kirkland couldn’t believe what she was being told. The caller on Thursday had a message about her granddaughter, Kaia Rolle. The 6-year-old had been arrested at her Orlando charter school and was going to be taken to a juvenile facility. … The Orlando Police Department said it is now investigating actions taken by Dennis Turner, the school resource officer who arrested Kaia and an 8-year-old student in separate events on the same day last week. Turner is accused of not following the department’s policy regarding juvenile arrests … According to the policy, any arrests of minors under the age of 12 needs approval from a supervisor … Authorities declined to identify the two children who were arrested or disclose details about their cases, only noting that they were both students at a local charter school and charged with misdemeanors. Their arrests have renewed scrutiny on policing in schools, which advocates and studies say often unfairly targets students of color and those with disabilities, landing the young people in handcuffs for routine misbehavior.”

-- An Oregon lawmaker said her daughter was “racially profiled by a mall cop,” and now she’s calling for a “loiter-in.” Katie Shepherd reports: “When a mall security guard tapped on her car window, 17-year-old Christine Bynum didn’t know what she and her two friends had done wrong. … ‘We were sitting in the car for no more than 20 minutes, when a very authoritative mall cop circled around the car,’ Christine told The Post in a text message... The girls, who are black, were drinking chocolate milk, eating Kit Kat bars and looking at homecoming dresses on Pinterest, she said. The security guard told the girls the mall had ‘very strict policies for loitering,’ said Christine ... ‘We didn’t even know what the word meant,’ Christine told her mother, Oregon state Rep. Janelle Bynum (D). … On Sunday, the state legislator took to social media to encourage people in her district to show up at the Clackamas Town Center mall for a ‘loiter-in’ over the next week, suggesting that people should wait in the food court, sit on benches in the mall and scroll through their social media accounts in the parking lot. ‘Go see how long it takes to be asked to leave the mall by mall security,’ Bynum wrote. ‘Let’s figure out if there’s a difference between loitering or being the wrong color.’”

President Donald Trump doubled down on his call to investigate Vice President Joe Biden. (Ron Sachs/Pool)

At The White House

THE LATEST ON UKRAINE: President Trump admitted yesterday that he mentioned former vice president Joe Biden during a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Refresher: The Post first reported last week that Trump pressured Zelensky on the call to investigate a gas company with ties to Hunter Biden — the subject of a whistleblower’s complaint. The call coincides with the Trump administration withholding $250 million of military and intelligence aid to Ukraine.

There is no evidence that Trump mentioned the aid as leverage on the call with the new Ukrainian leader but the administration only greenlit the aid last week after the whistleblower's complaint spilled into public view.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

Later on in the day, Trump told reporters in Houston that he'd “have the right” to mention Biden's name with Zelensky and that he'd “love” to release a transcript of the call: “I’m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son … Joe’s got a lot of problems. Joe’s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing,” suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.”

“I’m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son … Joe’s got a lot of problems. Joe’s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing,” suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.” Reminder: There is no evidence that Biden committed any wrongdoing.

Full-court press: Trump's admission came hours after senior members of his administration pulled off a full-court press on the Sunday shows, arguing they supported investigating whether Biden may have participated in “corrupt” behavior.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended Trump’s conversation with Zelensky and claimed it would be inappropriate to publish the transcript between the two leaders.

“America cannot have our elections interfered with. … If there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I would say these are confidential discussions between two foreign leaders but I think the bigger issue is Biden came out this weekend saying he never had any discussions with his son. His son came out and said he had had business discussions with his father so I think that the real issue is not what the president said, but what, indeed, did Biden’s son do,” Mnuchin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

All eyes on UNGA: Trump is scheduled to meet with Zelensky this week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.

As for Biden, he finally responded to Trump's claims over the weekend:

Let’s be clear, Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections. It goes against everything the United States stands for.

On The Hill

Changing minds: The fallout from the episode is unlikely to subside in the immediate future as some House Democrats who have resisted calls to initiate an impeachment inquiry are now changing course. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has also refused to hand over the whistleblower's complaint to Congress and this could all come to a head on Thursday, when he is slated to testify publicly before the House Intelliegence Committee. The DNI's inspector general will testify before the committee behind closed doors.

“No director of national intelligence has ever refused to turn over a whistleblower complaint,” Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.”

The most important voice: “If the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Democrats.

""The growing calls to impeach Trump — or do something bold to confront the White House — follows an embarrassing week for House Democrats,"" my collaegue Rachael Bade reports. ""Many feel increasingly helpless in fighting the White House’s obstruction, as Pelosi looks to the courts to uphold congressional subpoenas, a process that has taken months and could drag out for years.""

Inherent contempt: Some House Democrats were fed up after Corey Lewandowski's in-your-face testimony last week, and urged invoking little-used powers to jail or fine people who defy subpoenas. “I say do it,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), according to Rachael. “Let them argue in court that they take the position that it’s legally questionable. We back off of everything! We’ve been very weak.”

Impeachment: Pelosi might not have used the word impeachment in the letter but Schiff went further than he has when it comes to the ""I"" word. Notably, he spoke with Pelosi spoke over the weekend “to coordinate their statements,” per the New York Times's Nick Fandos, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman.

“I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment,” Schiff said on CNN's 'State of the Union'. “But if the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents.”

What's giving House Dems some more confidence about impeachment? They're hearing it a bit more in their districts. Three House Ds from v diff parts of the country all told us the same on Sunday. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 23, 2019

From the right: Several senior Republican lawmakers surprisingly broke with the party line and called for the administration to release the transcript of Trump's call.

“I’m hoping the president can share, in an appropriate way, information to deal with the drama around the phone call,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told the Times. “I think it would be good for the country if we could deal with it.”

“If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted.

Nevertheless, it's unlikely that Republicans will publicly challenge Trump on the issue. Eighteen House Republicans to date have ""announced plans to resign, retire or run for another office,"" my colleague Rachael Bade reports -- ""a reminder of just how much Trump has remade the GOP — and of the purge of those who dare to oppose him.""

“We’re here for a purpose — and it’s not this petty, childish b------t,” Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), 62, told Rachael an interview in early September of his decision to retire after Trump's tweet telling four U.S. congresswomen to ""go back"" to their countries of origin.

WHO ISN'T COMING TO THE UNGA CLIMATE SUMMIT: U.N. Secretary General António Guterres is today holding a special climate summit in which he has demanded that participating countries “bring with them promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of coal-fired power plants,” report Brady Dennis and Steve Mufson. The summit is taking place as part of the U.N. General Assembly annual meeting this week in New York.

Key quote: "" “I told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,” Guterres told reporters this week. “We are losing the race against climate change. Our world is off track.”

“I told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,” Guterres told reporters this week. “We are losing the race against climate change. Our world is off track.” Not coming: “U.N. officials have said that only the countries that have promised meaningful new pledges — probably about 60 nations — will be allowed one of the three-minute speaking slots throughout the day,” Steven writes. “The United States isn't one of them.”

“U.N. officials have said that only the countries that have promised meaningful new pledges — probably about 60 nations — will be allowed one of the three-minute speaking slots throughout the day,” Steven writes. “The United States isn't one of them.” But: The administration will attend UNGA (Trump is expected to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines).

Steven provided Power Up with some other insights on the week ahead — namely the contrasts between the Obama administration and Trump administration on climate change:

“The meeting at the UN general assembly and climate sessions couldn't be more different,” Steven wrote us in an email. “President Trump has declared that he will withdraw from the Paris accord just as soon as possible -- which happens to be the day after the 2020 election. But that is just a formality. The Trump administration is already busy trying to roll back Obama era regulations and legislation. And the president has praised Brazil's new president, who favors development of the Amazon, and used most of his firepower with China on trade.

But that is just a formality. The Trump administration is already busy trying to roll back Obama era regulations and legislation. And the president has praised Brazil's new president, who favors development of the Amazon, and used most of his firepower with China on trade. For President Obama, the negotiations on climate change were among the high points of his diplomatic record. He corralled a group of difficult allies — China, India and Brazil — to make unprecedented commitments to slow or reverse greenhouse gas emissions. Those countries might have been upset that the United States had already emitted far more, but they bit their tongues and joined the international accord reached in December 2015.”

One glaring example of the sea change will be the absence of the United States from the podium Monday. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has demanded that the countries attending Monday’s summit bring with them promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of coal-fired power plants.”

The Campaign

SANDERS IS IN TROUBLE: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ""has begun to eclipse [Sen. Bernie] Sanders’s once-dominant standing among the Democratic Party’s most liberal voters and surpass him in some polls in the first two states in the nominating process: Iowa and New Hampshire,"" our colleagues Sean Sullivan, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Chelsea Janes report.

This comes at a bad time for Bernie: ""These challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders’s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign quietly fired its Iowa political director in the late summer and has yet to name a replacement — a key vacancy as the race enters a crucial phase, with less than five months to go before the February caucuses,"" our colleagues write.

“We haven’t seen anything like this in my lifetime,” said William A. Galston, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution who graduated from college just before Watergate. “He appears to be daring the rest of the political system to stop him — and if it doesn’t, he’ll go further.”

The effort — which came as the Trump administration was withholding financial and military support from Ukraine to help the small democracy protect itself against Russian aggression — illustrates Trump’s expansive view of executive power and what appears to be a cavalier attitude about legal limits on his conduct.

While Mueller’s investigation did not place Trump directly in the Russian conspiracy to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and boost Trump’s candidacy, the president was an active participant in the Ukrainian episode, which was brought to light by an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint.

Trump has said he did nothing improper in his calls with Zelensky or any other foreign leader, and on Saturday he derided Democrats and the media for what he dubbed “the Ukraine Witch Hunt.”

But the scrutiny surrounding the phone call has brought fresh peril to Trump’s presidency and could turbocharge the drive by some House Democrats to open impeachment proceedings.

Democrats’ frustration with their inability to check Trump and hold him accountable for his conduct after nine months in the majority is starting to boil over. Lawmakers for the first time are saying publicly that their caucus looks feckless, and some are fretting that their flimsy oversight and reliance on the courts to eventually rescue them have proved fruitless.

House Democrats already are probing whether Trump and Giuliani withheld U.S. assistance to the Ukrainian government until it agreed to investigate possible corruption involving Biden and his son Hunter. But asked whether he or Trump were worried about congressional investigations, Giuliani laughed.

“They’re a bunch of headhunters and have lost any credibility,” the president’s lawyer said.

Giuliani said new scrutiny of Trump’s communications with Zelensky is welcome because it draws attention to Biden and his family’s involvement in Ukraine.

“The reality is, the more the Democrats press for an investigation of what I did in the Ukraine, I invite it,” Giuliani said. “I’m just doing my job as a poor, simple, little defense lawyer who’s defending his client.”

Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said the president has calculated that there is a political upside to spotlighting Ukraine and a story he believes “would crush Biden if people came to believe it was true.”

“If you’re going to be Andrew Jackson, there will be consequences, but he will be called ‘the great disrupter,’ ” Gingrich said, drawing parallels between the seventh president and 45th. “He gets up every morning and thinks, ‘What can I disrupt?’ He’s not going to back off.”

Trump’s sense of himself as above the law has been reinforced throughout his time in office. As detailed in the Mueller report, he received help from a foreign adversary in 2016 without legal consequence. He sought to thwart the Russia investigation and possibly obstruct justice without consequence. Through the government, he has earned profits for his businesses without consequence. He has blocked Congress’s ability to conduct oversight without consequence.

Now he is alleged to have leveraged taxpayer dollars and U.S. military might to extort a foreign government for opposition research on a political opponent, and it is unclear what consequences, if any, he may face.

“We got progressively desensitized,” said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in the Obama administration. “We’re learning progressively about wrongs, and one part gets absorbed before the next part gets revealed, so for whatever reason the public doesn’t get excited about it. It’s mystifying.”

One explanation is that Republicans in Congress have almost uniformly fallen in line behind Trump, reacting with instinctive nonchalance and blocking efforts to investigate his actions or hold him accountable.

AD

“What we’re discovering is that the Constitution is not a mechanism that runs by itself,” Galston said. “Ultimately, we are a government of men and not law. The law has no force without people who are willing to enforce it. The ball is now squarely in the court of the Republican Party, and particularly Senate Republicans. Will they ever be prepared to say enough is enough?”

Legal experts said it is extraordinary that Trump allegedly sought political assistance from a foreign government after a tortured, nearly three-year national conversation about the illegality of doing so. Asked what the president had learned from the Mueller investigation, former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman said, “Nothing. Zero.”

“I think he thinks it’s perfectly okay,” Akerman said. “This guy has got no scruples whatsoever. I don’t think he would stop for a second.”

Trump said in June that he would accept help with his 2020 reelection campaign from another country, which would be against the law.

“There’s nothing wrong with listening,” he told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. “If somebody called from a country, Norway — ‘We have information on your opponent’ — oh, I think I’d want to hear it.”

This past week, in a federal lawsuit in New York to block a subpoena issued by Manhattan prosecutors for his tax returns, Trump’s lawyers argued the sweeping legal theory that the Constitution does not allow for the president to be criminally investigated while in office. While the Justice Department has concluded that a president could not be indicted while in office, it has never suggested that simply investigating one would be off limits.

Trump’s moves in Ukraine are not a tertiary interest. For years, it has been a priority of the United States to boost the effective power of the Ukrainian military to form a bulwark against Russia.

Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and a senior national security and diplomatic official in past Republican and Democratic administrations, said Ukraine has been “a major interest of the United States — and if the stories are true, the president cavalierly thrust the national interests aside in favor of his personal political interests.”

“That is clearly wrong and clearly an abuse of power,” added Burns, who is informally advising Biden on foreign policy.

Trump has mocked the media for covering the whistleblower complaint, which he derided Friday as a “partisan” attack. Right-wing media personalities have buoyed Trump amid the onslaught, disparaging the anonymous whistleblower as part of a “deep state” conspiracy to remove the president from office.

“The coup actually is ongoing; it hasn’t stopped,” Rush Limbaugh insisted to his listeners this past week on his radio program, claiming there were “speech police” in the intelligence community.

Matthew G. Whitaker, Trump’s former acting attorney general, said on Fox News Channel, “This is a clear example of someone that’s part of the deep state in the intelligence community taking advantage of this whistleblower procedure and then trying to create this firestorm.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who recently met with Zelensky in Ukraine, said he and other Democrats are frustrated with the pervasive culture of inaction among congressional Republicans.

“If it’s true that the president requested that the president of Ukraine interfere in an American election, we are in really dangerous, brand-new territory,” Murphy said. “That’s absolutely, completely unacceptable in a democracy.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) often declares that “no one is above the law” and has vowed that her party would hold Trump “accountable.”

But she has refused so far to green-light impeachment proceedings — creating tensions with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), among others who favor impeachment — and instead has looked to the courts to counter the White House’s moves to stonewall Congress.

“When are we going to get serious about enforcing our subpoenas?” asked a frustrated Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who has pushed for leadership to fine Trump officials who are not compliant with their investigations. “We have to put some teeth into this.”

Some Democrats have gone so far as to suggest that House Democrats’ unwillingness to impeach Trump has only encouraged the president’s lawlessness.

“After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate, wrote Friday evening on Twitter. “By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.”

Democrats’ vocalization of a sense of helplessness was particularly acute at the end of an embarrassing week that underscored how the Trump administration has been able to run circles around their investigations.

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski turned in a defiant performance in front of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, dodging questions, talking over members and even promoting his own potential Senate bid and book sales.

Two days later, news broke that the administration was refusing to turn over the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump compromised national security with some sort of “promise” to a foreign official. Although the inspector general of the intelligence community deemed the matter credible and of “urgent” concern, the administration blocked the complaint from being shared with Congress.

“As president, he just overwhelms us,” lamented Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a former 2020 presidential candidate. “I mean, you’ve got kids in cages — we’re trying to deal with that. We’ve got the continued mass shootings, and he won’t help us with that. And then you’ve got the urgency of this [oversight]. So, I mean, it’s really just kind of, where do you prioritize your resources and your time?”"

The investigation Trump wanted to see was meant to focus on Biden’s push in late 2015 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who’d earned the ire of U.S. and international officials for turning a blind eye to corruption. Trump and his allies claim without evidence that Biden advocated for the prosecutor’s firing because the prosecutor may have been investigating a company on whose board Hunter Biden sat.

Shortly after Trump put that pressure on the Ukrainian president, his administration halted military aid to Ukraine that had been approved by Congress, only proceeding with that aid after a whistleblower within the intelligence community filed a complaint apparently focused on Trump’s conversation with Ukraine’s president.

In short, then, Trump may have tried to leverage congressionally sanctioned aid to boost his own reelection chances — or, at least, he reportedly leveraged his position as president to push a foreign nation to aid his reelection campaign.

In short order, Trump’s allies — by now well experienced in waving away concerns about his presidency — moved into action. In a series of appearances on television and radio, they identified the real wrongdoing in the situation, blaming a diaspora of people and organizations in an effort to downplay or erase questions about Trump.

Joe Biden is the real wrongdoer

Biden has been the most common target of Trump’s defenders and of Trump himself.

AD

“They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal.” @PeterSchweizer The problem is, “Trump” did nothing wrong! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2019

The way those defenses are offered, though, varies.

On Sunday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” Pompeo, a stalwart defender of his boss, suggested that the situation was indeed not complicated: Biden did something wrong.

AD

“If there was election interference that took place by the vice president, I think the American people deserve to know,” Pompeo said, referring to Biden — and echoing the questions that have lingered around Trump’s 2016 victory since before his presidency began. “We know there was interference in the 2016 election and if it’s the case that there was something going on with the President or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that.”

Axios noted how Trump’s most fervent media defender, Fox News, positioned the story Sunday, compared with MSNBC. MSNBC noted how Trump was trying to shift questions onto Biden — and Fox embraced that precise shift.

It’s worth noting the particularly sloppy defense that Fox News chose to highlight. It was an interview with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. The suggestion Nunes made wasn’t only that Biden was culpable but, indeed, that he was already paying a political cost for being so deeply mired in this controversy.

AD

AD

“These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,” Nunes said. “So now that these have been resurrected, it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero.”

The allegation that Biden did something wrong in December 2015 didn’t originate with an effort by Hillary Clinton to keep Biden out of the race, given that he announced he wasn’t running that year in October 2015. What’s more, Nunes’s claim that Biden’s lead was “down to zero” was apparently based on a new poll in Iowa where Biden is running even with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

That poll was conducted before the Ukraine story emerged in the news.

AD

The problem with this theory? The central problem with the Biden-did-wrong theory is a dearth of evidence that Biden did anything wrong. While it’s easy to see how Biden’s demands about the Ukrainian prosecutor could be spun as an effort to aid his son, there has been no evidence to emerge that Hunter Biden’s role was the motivation for that firing, that Biden acted alone in making the demand, that he knew of an investigation or that an investigation into the company even existed. Instead of rewriting our Fact Checkers’ analysis of the situation, we’ll instead just point you to that article.

AD

And we’ll note that advocating for a prosecutor who is more likely to fight hard on corruption would seem like a weird choice.

Hunter Biden is the real wrongdoer

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin marched boldly into a minefield while talking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday.

AD

“What I do find inappropriate is the fact that Vice President Biden at the time’s son did very significant business dealings in Ukraine,” Mnuchin said of the controversy. “I, for one, find that to be concerning. And, to me, that is the issue perhaps that should be further investigated.”

“I don’t understand,” Tapper replied. “So it is okay for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Jr. to do business all over the world, it’s okay for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president, but while Vice President Joe Biden was vice president, his son shouldn’t have been able to do business dealings?”

AD

Mnuchin stumbled.

AD

“Again, I don’t — I don’t really want to go into more of these details,” he said, “other than to say …”

“Well, you’re just setting a precedent that the president is violating,” Tapper replied.

“Again, I think there is a significant difference in what you’re saying, okay, or what I was saying between Biden and his son’s relationship with the Ukraine oligarch,” Mnuchin said, “and potential business dealings that the Trump Organization has had which predated his presidency.”

That can be a subtle distinction. In August, for example, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to Indonesia to tout a resurrected resort there. It was in the works before Trump’s presidency, but at least one ethics group questions the extent to which it stretches Trump’s pledge that the Trump Organization would not to engage in new international deals during his presidency.

AD

AD

Trump Jr., meanwhile, expressed his own support for the idea that Hunter Biden had acted inappropriately, favoriting a tweet criticizing Hunter Biden’s having apparently profited from his father’s name.

The problem with this theory? While it’s certainly fair to question the appropriateness of a vice president’s child partnering with a foreign company, there is also some hypocrisy to those criticisms in this case. And, as above, there’s no evidence that Hunter Biden’s role prompted Biden’s demands.

Ukraine is the real wrongdoer

Trump and his allies have repeatedly pointed to Ukraine and Ukrainian politics to defend Trump since he took office. As questions arose about the 2016 Trump campaign’s interactions with Russian actors, Trump’s team tried to gin up a countervailing theory that Ukraine was working to boost Hillary Clinton.

AD

AD

In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggested that Ukraine’s role broadly should earn scrutiny.

“All things Trump have been looked at regarding Russia. Now it’s time for all things Ukraine to be looked at,” Graham said. “I like Joe Biden. I’ve been a friend of his for a very long time. But we can’t have two standards here. The prosecutor was looking at things in the Ukraine, and he got fired, and there’s all kind of allegations about the Ukraine dumping information into the legal system and political system in 2016 about Manafort and others, you know, Hunter Biden, what kind of situation did he have financially? I’m hoping somebody will take a look at all things Ukraine like they did with Russia from the Department of Justice.”

The problem with this theory? The theories about Ukraine trying to influence U.S. politics or the 2016 election have consistently been shown to lack merit.

AD

The theory that Ukraine was “dumping information” in 2016 centers on two incidents. In one, a contractor with the Democratic National Committee sought help from people at the Ukrainian Embassy in digging into then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s work in that country. In the other, evidence that Manafort had received secret payments from a pro-Russian political party was released by a Ukrainian organization in August 2016, leading to his ouster from the campaign.

In neither case is there evidence of a top-down effort on the part of Ukraine to aid Clinton. Both center on efforts to uncover information on Manafort, whose payments for his work for Ukraine led to convictions for money laundering and fraud. He is now in prison.

The whistleblower is the real wrongdoer

This story came to national attention after the Trump administration sought to prevent Congress from seeing the original complaint from a whistleblower inside the intelligence community. Mirroring months of attacks on the FBI agents who’d probed the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia, Trump allies cast the whistleblower as a “deep state” “spy” who had behaved dishonorably in bringing the story to light.

Gregg Jarrett: ""He appears to be an American spy spying on the president, listening in on conversations."" pic.twitter.com/nYOdLeHdna — Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) September 23, 2019

On Fox News last week, while acknowledging that he didn’t have broad context for what the whistleblower’s allegation was, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) declared that the situation looked like “another Deep State attack.” Speaking to Fox News’s Bret Baier on Friday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) insisted that all of the facts weren’t out, but that this appeared to be part of a pattern of someone “selectively put[ting] something out” to try to undermine the results of the 2016 election.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of Trump’s most energetic defenders, told reporters that there are “people in the intelligence community and other parts of the government who just have it out for the president.”

“I don’t have any worries about the president,” he added.

The problem with this theory? Even if the whistleblower were Hillary Clinton herself, it wouldn’t change the content of the conversation Trump had with Zelensky.

The media is the real wrongdoer

At an event in Texas over the weekend, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) identified his own culprit in the situation: reporters covering the story.

“I am a little troubled that apparently some of the initial reports came from somebody who didn’t have firsthand knowledge, and then it sort of took off like a wildfire,” Cornyn said of the story. “Lot of speculation. I’d prefer to wait until we get the access to the real information to make a judgment.”

Of course, the problem with that is that Congress was blocked from getting the whistleblower’s report in the first place. That’s what prompted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to subpoena the document.

Cornyn is not alone. In his interview with Hewitt, Graham suggested that the Ukraine story “makes the [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh story look like good journalism” — a reference to assertions from conservatives that the New York Times’s article about accusations against Kavanaugh was fatally flawed.

Trump shared a clip from Fox News in which Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) blames the media for the story, suggesting that it was simply part of the same complaints about Trump that have existed since he took office.

“It’s exactly the kind of thing they’ve been accusing Trump of all along,” Meadows said. “Can you imagine if the prosecutor in Ukraine, if his name was ‘Bob Mueller,’ what would have happened?”

It’s not clear what that means.

The problem with this theory? The simplest way to undermine the media’s reporting as incorrect or overly eager is to release the whistleblower complaint and the transcript of the Zelensky call so that the reporting can be contrasted with reality. So far, the administration hasn’t done so.

There was no wrongdoing at all!

This is the angle taken by Trump.

On Sunday, he claimed that the call with Zelensky was a “beautiful, warm, nice conversation” in which he didn’t pressure Zelensky at all. He later tweeted “breaking news” to that effect, spinning things back to Biden once again.

The problem with this theory? The American public is being asked to decide whom to believe, Trump or press reports. Trump’s assertion that nothing untoward happened depends, for now, on taking his word over that of the media and our sources."

AD

They both support what would be a massive economic restructuring with ideas such as Medicare-for-all, but Sanders, 78, has carved out his brand as a democratic socialist while Warren, 70, has described herself as a capitalist who has operated more as part of the Democratic mainstream. While Sanders drew notice in 2016 for his avid fans and big crowds, it is Warren this time who is gaining traction that way.

AD

These challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders’s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign quietly fired its Iowa political director in the late summer and has yet to name a replacement — a key vacancy as the race enters a crucial phase, with less than five months to go before the February caucuses.

Sanders’s difficulties in Iowa have come into sharper focus over the weekend. The most respected pollster in the state released a survey late Saturday showing Warren surging to 22 percent, two points ahead of former vice president Joe Biden, with Sanders at 11 percent. That places him third in the state where he fought Hillary Clinton to a near draw in 2016, launching an electrifying national movement.

AD

Perhaps more worrisome for Sanders, the poll provided the clearest indication yet that Warren is eating into his base. She is winning a bigger share of people who caucused for Sanders in 2016 than he is, and she is outpacing him among those under 35, his former strong suit, according to the survey conducted by Selzer and Co. for the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom.

AD

“I give him tremendous credit for changing the conversation,” said Rod Sullivan, a Johnson County supervisor who introduced Sanders at a campaign stop in 2015 and now backs Warren. “We need to get that kind of stuff done and I think there’s a better way to get it done now. Last time was a binary choice and this time I think there are better messengers.”

Sanders campaign officials, dismissing the notion that their candidate is struggling, vowed Sunday to plow ahead with aggressive moves to win the Iowa caucuses. The Sanders campaign announced last week it has attracted 1 million individual donors, a historic mark that officials said is a strong sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy.

AD

“Unlike Bernie Sanders, polls are inconsistent and all over the place, including an Iowa poll that came a few days ago,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. “We feel good about our field operation in the state and our team is working harder and harder each day to urge people to caucus for a once-in-a-lifetime candidate.”

AD

Sanders will embark Monday on a “Bernie Beats Trump” tour across the state, an effort to argue that he is the most electable choice against President Trump in 2020. But his more immediate obstacle is Warren, whom he has refrained from criticizing, though some of his surrogates have been more aggressive.

Sanders has sought to stand out from the pack by emphasizing his decades-long advocacy of sweeping ideas such as Medicare-for-all, something he did at a Sunday rally in Warren’s childhood hometown of Norman, Okla.

AD

“It is unique and maybe unique in American history,” Sanders said of his campaign, as he encouraged supporters to join a nationwide grass-roots movement. After they started chanting his name, he replied, “It ain’t Bernie, it’s you.”

For loyal followers such as C.J. Petersen of Breda, Iowa, Sanders’s consistency merits support at the caucuses. “Senator Warren is fantastic,” the 29-year-old said. “But Bernie has been on these issues in the very beginning.”

AD

But for many others, that’s no longer enough. Matt Shockley, a 24-year-old teacher from Oklahoma City who attended the Sanders rally in Norman, said he voted for Sanders in 2016, but now is leaning toward Warren.

AD

“She’s very warm as a person and she has her own kind of charisma,” he said. “I think that will really help in the general. And on policy, she and Bernie are so similar, it doesn’t feel like there’s much of a trade-off in voting for her over him.”

As the Sanders campaign tries to hang on to voters like Shockley, employee disputes and staff shake-ups have jolted the senator’s organization, stretching from important early states to the Washington headquarters, leading to firings, resignations, tense meetings and fierce rivalries, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

In New Hampshire, where Sanders defeated Clinton by 22 points but is now in close competition with Warren and Biden, Sanders recently changed state directors. The operation had been tumultuous for months, people with knowledge with the situation said.

AD

AD

Some of the internal friction has touched the highest levels of the campaign. A dispute over salaries earlier this year pitted rank-and-file field staff against campaign management. On a conference call the day after a Washington Post report about the standoff, Shakir bluntly warned any leakers to quickly leave the campaign, speaking in a tone that angered some participants, people with knowledge of the call said.

The Post interviewed 30 present and past Sanders aides, allies and voters for this report. Many who described the tension in the campaign spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.

Warren has been building a robust operation in Iowa that many local Democratic strategists said is the most impressive in the field. She has been picking off former Sanders backers, including some of his earliest champions.

AD

AD

The Sanders campaign brushed aside questions about firing its Iowa political director, Jess Mazour, in the late summer. “We’ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,” Shakir said in a written statement after The Post contacted the campaign last week. Mazour did not respond to requests for comment.

Although friction and turnover are not uncommon in the high-pressure environment of presidential campaigns, the extent of the discord in the Sanders operation has surprised some Democrats inside and outside the campaign. They say it reflects a departure from Sanders’s 2016 effort.

“As presidential campaigns go, the 2016 Sanders campaign had less conflict than most,” said Mark Longabaugh, a lead strategist on that run who abruptly parted ways with the campaign on the eve of Sanders’s entrance into the 2020 race.

AD

AD

Sanders campaign officials played down the personnel changes and said his unique platform of demanding revolutionary change will ultimately propel him to victory.

“Senator Sanders is very confident. He is feeling good about the campaign. We believe this race is down to the three people and we have the best ground game,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of Sanders’s national co-chairs.

Khanna was speaking about Warren and Biden, who along with Sanders, have appeared at the top of most recent state and national surveys.

Inside the Sanders campaign in New Hampshire, there were issues at the top levels of the campaign from its earliest days. State director Joe Caiazzo and senior strategist Kurt Ehrenberg, two veterans of the 2016 campaign, were in constant conflict, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

AD

The workplace situation became so strained earlier this year that a human resources official had to intervene, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

Caiazzo and Ehrenberg declined to comment for this story. Caiazzo was recently reassigned to run the Sanders campaign in Massachusetts and Ehrenberg is no longer with the campaign.

Shakir said the personnel decisions were of no concern. “We’ve built a great team in New Hampshire and are in a really strong position there,” Shakir said in a statement explaining the moves.

Yet for some Sanders supporters, the New Hampshire Democratic convention earlier this month served as a sobering moment. In a state where Sanders won just over 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 primary, he was no longer the top draw.

Sanders took the stage in Manchester to a rousing ovation, to as many full chairs as anyone then had earned, and to a room of waving signs bearing his name. It was louder than the reception greeting for anyone else — until Warren took the stage to a two-minute ovation not long after."

The early state polling drought in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest really does seem to be ending. After this weekend’s gold-standard Selzer poll from Iowa, today we received results from high-quality polls in New Hampshire (Monmouth) and Nevada (USA Today/Suffolk).

The most immediate news in this mini-harvest of public opinion is that the Monmouth poll qualified a 12th candidate for the October Democratic debates in Ohio by taking 2 percent, Tulsi Gabbard now has met the four-poll 2 percent threshold. This development all but eliminates any doubts that this round of debates will again be a two-day affair, after the brief bliss of ten candidates fitting on the same stage in Houston earlier this month.

The same poll, though, continues a string of bad results for Bernie Sanders in terms of his standing in early states vis-à-vis his progressive rival Elizabeth Warren. Monmouth has Warren now edging Joe Biden in the Granite State by a 27-25 margin — but with Sanders down to 12 percent, just ahead of Pete Buttigieg with 10 percent. This is extremely similar to what Selzer found in Iowa (Warren 22 percent, Biden 20 percent, Sanders 11 percent, Buttigieg 9 percent). That makes any suspicion (based on an national poll in August showing Warren in a three-way tie with Biden and Sanders) that Monmouth is somehow putting a thumb on the scales for Warren a non-starter. The USA Today/Suffolk poll of Nevada shows Biden still in the lead with 23 percent, but Sanders at 14 percent is trailing Warren’s 19 percent by a significant margin. Indeed, as Nate Silver pointed out (a bit too avidly, you might say, but accurately), poor early state poll numbers for Sanders are becoming too routine for comfort:

This is a list Bernie Sanders' standing in all early- state polls since the Houston debate



IA: 9% (David Binder Research)

IA: 11% (Selzer)

NH: 12% (Monmouth)

NV: 14% (Suffolk)

IA: 16% (Civiqs) — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 24, 2019

As a reminder, Sanders won nearly half the vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2016, along with 60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.

Like his fellow late-septuagenarian Joe Biden, Sanders is doing quite a bit better in national polls. The latest RealClearPolitics averages have Biden at 30 percent, Warren at 20 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent, with Buttigieg way back at 6 percent. But the trends aren’t great for Bernie. For months one of his bulwarks was the vast Morning Consult tracking poll. He’s now fallen behind Warren there, too.

Aside from the good news for Gabbard concerning the October debates, we are now in the window when selected polls will count toward qualification for the November debate, too. With today’s releases, there are now two national qualifying polls and three from the early states, with the threshold now up to a three percent showing in four national and/or early state polls, or 5 percent from two early state polls. The Big Three plus Buttigieg and Harris are hitting these thresholds routinely, but among the iffier candidates, it’s notable that Booker and Yang now have two qualifying polls, while Klobuchar, O’Rourke, and Steyer have just one (September debate participant Julian Castro has been skunked so far, as has Gabbard, whose qualifying number from Monmouth for October fell short of the November threshold).

We’re probably looking at a single night of debates in November, but the thing to watch is whether the current Big Three of Biden, Warren, and Sanders is looking more like a Big Two with Bernie slipping back and perhaps some other candidate coming on."

Most of the buzz surrounding the release over the weekend of the latest gold-standard Iowa poll from Ann Selzer (for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom) involved the candidates who have long been at the top of the heap. In particular, Selzer showed Elizabeth Warren (22 percent) moving ahead of Joe Biden (20 percent), and having double the level of support as third-place Bernie Sanders (11 percent). No other candidate was in double figures, and fourth-placed Pete Buttigieg (9 percent) lost six points since the last Iowa poll in June. So the bottom line was continued churn among the Big Three, with Warren showing the most momentum, but with not much shaking lower on the long list of candidates.

But Selzer also compiled favorable/unfavorable ratios for the candidates, and a look at them may help to discern which of today’s bottom-feeders have true dark horse potential, and which are probably going nowhere fast. Nine active candidates have positive net favorability numbers among likely caucus-goers:

Warren +58 Buttigieg +56 Harris +39 Booker +38 Biden +37 Klobuchar +30 O’Rourke +28 Sanders +22 Yang +6

But nine others are underwater:

Castro -1 Bennet -3 Bullock -5 Gabbard -5 Steyer -5 Sestak -14 Ryan -15 Delaney -17 Williamson -39

Two of the candidates with net negative favorability ratings (Castro and Steyer) have qualified for the October debates, and one other (Gabbard) is one qualifying poll away from making the stage with eight days left before the deadline.

Yes, this is just one poll from one state, albeit a highly regarded poll from the single-most important state, but it provides some evidence that below the Big Three are five who are making enough of a positive impression on Iowa Democrats that a late surge isn’t at all out of the question. And actually, all of the those five have higher net favorability numbers than Bernie Sanders, which increases the bad news he got from Selzer.

Not many pollsters offer favorability/unfavorability ratings for the entire field, but one national tracking poll that does, Morning Consult, offers a somewhat different take, from findings collected just after the September debate. It shows only one candidate, Marianne Williamson, having an underwater favorability ratio (-6). Here’s the rest of the field (Morning Consult didn’t bother to poll Joe Sestak):

Sanders +59 Biden +54 Warren +52 Harris +38 Buttigieg +33 O’Rourke +31 Booker +30 Yang +22 Klobuchar +21 Castro +11 Gabbard +11 Steyer +8 Bennet +6 Bullock +6 Delaney +3 Ryan +1

The rankings are pretty similar, with the exception of a big difference of opinion over Bernie Sanders (the most popular candidate nationally, per MC, but only the eighth most popular in Iowa, per Selzer), and some less dramatic divergences over candidates in the middle of the pack like Yang and Klobuchar (much more popular, unsurprisingly, in next-door Iowa).

At this point you’d have to figure October-debate non-qualifiers Bennet, Bullock, Delaney, Ryan, and Sestak are pretty toasty, with possible qualifier Gabbard and qualifiers Castro and Steyer not looking so hot, either. Yang’s on the bubble, as is Klobuchar, though her relative strength in Iowa could keep her aloft. But if you’re looking for a dark horse at this point, it’s probably going to be from the group that includes Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, and O’Rourke. So in your mental road-map of the race you should probably add a Little Four to the Big Three. And if Cory Booker’s campaign isn’t bluffing in its recent distress signal about fundraising, the list of plausible dark horses could soon shrink further."

So why do they keep cranking up the Boss?

Because Springsteen embodies white working-class Rust Belt voters who, until recently, constituted a core Democratic voting bloc.

In Springsteen, Democrats see an archetype of the white working class, one who can help them woo the voters in the Rust Belt and farm states who have turned various shades of Republican red over the past half-century. However, winning the white working-class vote requires more than Springsteen songs. It requires running on a platform of worker-focused economic populism that would address the policy concerns embedded in his lyrics.

Raised in Freehold, N.J., Springsteen had a decidedly working-class upbringing. His mother worked as a legal secretary, often providing the family’s sole source of income as his father — who struggled with mental illness and alcoholism — bounced between blue-collar jobs.

AD

AD

Springsteen himself never worked in a factory. Instead, he threw himself into music that reflected his background. Springsteen’s breakthrough 1975 album, “Born to Run,” is about young people yearning to escape, kids who “work all day to blow ‘em away in the night” (“Night”). The rocker’s next four albums focused on characters who never got out of their factory towns. On “Darkness on the Edge of Town” (1978) and “The River” (1980), Springsteen’s characters found themselves trapped by familial responsibility in deadening jobs. Instead of driving off into the sunset, they were left working all day in their father’s garage, “driving all night chasing some mirage” and longing for the day they could “blow away the dreams” that break their hearts (“The Promised Land”).

On the acoustic “Nebraska” (1982) and the misunderstood “Born in the U.S.A.” (1984), which launched Springsteen into international superstardom, the singer progressed from examining characters facing personal disappointment to those victimized by an economic system rigged against them. Through no fault of their own, his characters are laid off from textile mills (“My Hometown”), lumber yards (“Downbound Train”) and oil refineries (“Born in the U.S.A.”) and are unable to find work, often leading to desperate, criminal acts, as on “Johnny 99” and “Atlantic City.” While his characters of the ’70s sought emotional satisfaction, Springsteen’s characters of the ’80s sought survival by any means necessary.

Springsteen’s songs mirrored the experience of many blue-collar workers in the 1970s and 1980s. After steadily increasing for almost three decades, blue-collar wages began to fall in 1973, and inflation began eating a larger share of workers’ paychecks. Meanwhile, rising oil prices sped factory flight, as companies deserted unionized Rust Belt states for the less regulated confines of the South or, increasingly, other countries. Especially in former manufacturing centers, unemployment and despair grew.

These economic changes quickened a long-simmering transformation in the politics of white working-class voters. Since the 1930s, union members in the Rust Belt had been one of the backbones of the Democratic Party’s New Deal Coalition, a broad tent of voters that also included urban African Americans and white Southerners. The coalition gave Democrats majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate for all but four years between 1933 and 1981.

The coalition began to fracture in the late 1960s and 1970s. White Rust Belt workers began to shift their political allegiances based on issues such as welfare, busing to desegregate public schools and opposition to the counterculture. The transition was completed when these voters became the “Reagan Democrats” who helped propel Ronald Reagan to the White House in 1980. Even if many workers felt betrayed by Reagan’s pro-business agenda, cultural issues had turned a solid flank of the Democratic Party into loyal Republicans.

For their part, Democrats largely forfeited these voters in favor of a new constituency: liberal suburban professionals, many of whom paired free-market proclivities with liberal cultural positions. Democratic presidential nominees such as Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton envisioned their core supporters not in unions halls and factories, but in universities and office buildings. Bill Clinton and Obama espoused populist economic messages that helped recapture some of the lost voters, but the geographic and cultural center of the party had definitively shifted.

As the real-life versions of his characters turned into Republicans, Springsteen did not. The singer came to understand that it was not government, but profit-hungry corporations that were responsible for everyday people’s struggles to make a decent living and for the devastation inflicted on communities when good-paying jobs disappeared.

And yet, Springsteen stayed out of the partisan fray. He called Reagan’s victory in 1980 “pretty frightening” and shrugged off an attempt by Reagan to co-opt his music in 1984. As he told Rolling Stone in 1987: “I never considered myself a particularly political person. I wasn’t when I was younger, and I don’t think I really am now.”

That changed in 2004, thanks to the second Iraq War. Long wracked with guilt about purposefully failing his draft examination during the Vietnam War, Springsteen could not stomach another unjustified foreign intervention. In 2004, he headlined the Vote for Change tour to raise money for Democratic electoral efforts. For each presidential election cycle since, he has hit the campaign trail to rouse Democratic rally audiences.

To Democrats, Springsteen is not just another celebrity endorser. While foreign policy may have politicized him personally, his songs from the past 40 years address the economic frustration that helped fuel the exodus of the white working class from the Democratic coalition. By having Springsteen at their campaign events and by playing his music at their rallies, Democrats signal that their tent is still big enough to include the white working class.

But music — even music as powerful and as popular as Springsteen’s — cannot serve as a substitute for policy, particularly the pro-worker, economic populism that made the white working class solidly Democratic in the 1930s. To overcome these voters’ conservative cultural inclinations, Democrats need proposals to address the effects of deindustrialization, to stop corporate attacks on labor unions and to increase workers’ wages.

To help bring these voters back into the Democratic fold, candidates should focus less on what Springsteen himself represents and focus instead on the meaning of his music. If they want to win the Rust Belt, Democrats’ message should reflect Springsteen’s one-line introduction to “Born to Run” on his 1984 tour, a simple idea that encapsulates the economic ideals at the heart of his politics: “Nobody wins, unless everybody wins.”

Never before have I seen Democratic candidates do so much to woo workers and win over union leaders. Elizabeth Warren kicked off her campaign at the site of the famous 1912 Bread and Roses textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Julián Castro marched in Durham, North Carolina, with fast-food workers demanding a $15 wage, while Pete Buttigieg spoke outside Uber headquarters in San Francisco alongside drivers demanding to be considered employees. Joe Biden held his first official campaign event at a Teamsters union hall in Pittsburgh. Kamala Harris has called for a raise averaging $13,500 for the nation’s schoolteachers, while Bernie Sanders has bolstered labor’s cause by using his email lists to urge supporters to join union picket lines.

Why all this sudden attention and affection for workers and unions — far more than I’ve ever seen during my nearly 25 years of writing about labor? Part of it is that this year’s Democratic candidates are doing what any smart politician would do when the field is so large — court one of the party’s largest constituencies, i.e., unions and their members. Part of it is that the candidates see that something is seriously broken in our economy: that income inequality, corporate profits, and the stock market have all been soaring while wages have largely stagnated for decades. Also, Democrats realize that a big reason Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 was that she didn’t show enough love to labor. The field seems to recognize that if a Democrat is going to win the presidency in 2020, the surest route is to win back the three longtime union strongholds — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that were key to Donald Trump’s victory. So the candidates have loosed a flood of pro-worker ideas, not just to make it easier to unionize, but to extend paid sick days and family leave to all workers, provide protections to pregnant workers, and safeguard LGBTQ+ Americans from discrimination on the job.

Four of them — Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rouke, Pete Buttigieg, and Cory Booker — have put forward remarkably detailed platforms of pro-worker and pro-union proposals, while Elizabeth Warren’s elaborate plan on trade goes far beyond what many union leaders have called for. Andrew Yang says his universal basic income will be a boon for workers, providing a lifeline to those who lose their jobs because of artificial intelligence and robots. Biden has been vague so far on labor matters, calling himself a union man and saying he supports a $15 minimum. Booker has introduced a fairly radical bill, the Worker Dividend Act, which would require corporations that do stock buybacks to pay out to their employees a sizable chunk of the money going to the buyback.

Considering how many candidates there are and how many proposals and speeches they’ve made, it’s hard to keep track of who stands for what — and which plans are substantively the most pro-labor. Below, I give grades to the Democratic front-runners, based not just on the positions they’ve espoused during the campaign, but also on their track records. (Some candidates seem to have discovered the cause of workers only after announcing that they were running for the presidency.)

I confess to one bias in grading the candidates. In my new book, Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor, I write that union power and worker power in the U.S. have fallen to their weakest point since World War II, and that this has fueled wage stagnation, out-of-control income inequality and a warped political system in which corporations and billionaire donors have far too much sway and workers far too little. In grading, I give extra points to candidates who are pushing or proposing strategies to fix this systemic problem and give American workers more power — in the workplace, in politics, and in policymaking.

Some will complain that the grades I give are too high, but it is important to remember that when it comes to worker issues, every Democratic candidate is head and shoulders above almost every Republican lawmaker. Republicans overwhelmingly oppose a higher minimum wage and basic protections like paid sick days, seeming to dread displeasing corporate donors and lobbyists. Most Republicans favor weakening labor unions, not strengthening them. Moreover, the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation, has given the Democratic candidates’ high scores for their career legislative records: Cory Booker (100), Kamala Harris (100), Bernie Sanders (98), Elizabeth Warren (98), Julian Castro (96), Amy Klobuchar (95), Beto O’Rourke (94). Of the candidates, Joe Biden has the lowest AFL-CIO score (86), based on when he left the Senate in 2009. Some labor experts say that in the highly polarized Congress, in which Republicans are often seeking to undermine unions, it’s not hard for Democrats to garner high AFL-CIO ratings. Still, this year’s progressive crop of candidates supports many bills that would go far to help union and workers, like the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would make it easier to unionize, and the Healthy Families Act, which would require most companies to provide full-time workers with seven paid sick days a year.

A

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has fought for workers ever since he entered Congress in 1991, introducing the Workplace Democracy Act in 1992, and reintroducing it in every Congress since. That bill would make it easier for workers to unionize by, among other things, giving them a right to do so as soon as a majority of workers sign pro-union cards rather than through a lengthy election process that strongly favors employers.

Sanders didn’t suddenly start joining union picket lines this year. In 2015, he marched alongside Verizon workers as well as workers picketing outside their potato-starch factory in Cedar Rapids. Sanders told those workers in Iowa, “We are sick and tired of the war against working families.” In this election cycle, Sanders has already won the endorsement of the United Electrical Workers, a small union with 35,000 members.

The labor platform that Sanders has announced this year envisions doubling union membership in four years. It is a dream list for the nation’s unions. Sanders wants to strengthen workers’ clout through legislation that promotes industry-wide bargaining (instead of employer-by-employer bargaining). He would prohibit awarding federal contracts to companies that pay less than $15 an hour; he would also ban right-to-work laws, allow all government employees to unionize, and prohibit employers from permanently replacing workers who go on strike. In perhaps his most radical proposal, Sanders calls for ending America’s at-will employment system — he would prohibit employers from firing workers except for “just cause.”

Sanders’s platform for a Green New Deal has helped lead the way in reassuring unions upset with climate-change activists; he has called for a “just transition” for fossil-fuel workers who lose their jobs if and when the nation shutters coal-fired power plants and takes other actions to slow global warming. Sanders would guarantee those workers five years of current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pensions support, and “priority job replacement for any displaced worker.”

Sanders has loudly opposed free-trade agreements. His repeated calls for Medicare for All have cheered many workers and some labor leaders, even as Joe Biden has attacked Medicare for All, saying it would take away the excellent health coverage won by many unions.

Sanders’s supporters argue that he has long been the most pro-labor of the candidates, but others point out that for all his pro-worker rhetoric, he has racked up few concrete victories for workers. Sanders counters that he has led the way on, for example, legislation protecting IBM workers’ pensions and doubling home-heating assistance to help low-income workers. Sanders has been Congress’ most outspoken champion of a $15 minimum wage, and is often given credit for helping persuade Jeff Bezos to boost the base wage at Amazon to that level.

A

Elizabeth Warren

Warren doesn’t have a pro-labor record stretching back decades, but she has been a remarkable fount of innovative, pro-worker ideas. Some union officials told me that her proposal on trade was by far the best and most sophisticated they’ve ever seen from a lawmaker. Criticizing the U.S. for long pursuing “a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of American workers,” Warren has proposed using trade agreements as a tool “to force other countries to raise the bar on everything from labor and environmental standards to anti-corruption rules.” Asserting that corporate lobbyists have long whispered into the ears of our trade negotiators, Warren has called for a far more transparent process and proposed that worker, environmental, and consumer representatives sit on committees that advise America’s trade negotiators.

Warren’s “Plan for Economic Patriotism” is far more thoughtful than anything Trump has developed to encourage and bring back manufacturing jobs. She calls for leveraging federal R&D to spur investment and job creation, noting that Apple has used technologies developed through federally sponsored R&D to produce tens of millions of iPhones overseas. To aid depressed communities, Warren says, “R&D investments should be spread across every region of the country, not focused on only a few coastal cities.” To boost the job prospects of young Americans who don’t go to college, she has proposed a tenfold increase — a total of $20 billion over ten years — for apprenticeship programs.

In a daring proposal, Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act would give labor far more voice in the economy by letting workers elect 40 percent of the board members of large American corporations. Her path-breaking work to create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been a boon to working families, helping prevent banks from imposing extortionate fees and helping keep payday lenders from preying on down-on-their-luck workers.

As Blue Compass, a political and opposition research firm, makes clear, week after week Warren has done far more on social media than other candidates to go to bat for unions, for instance, doing videos on behalf of Las Vegas hotel workers seeking a contract. Amid concerns that Medicare for All might hurt some union members, Warren has pledged to include labor leaders in all Medicare for All discussions. “Strengthening America’s labor unions will be a central goal of my administration,” Warren told In These Times. She recently won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, which had endorsed Sanders in 2016.

Last Monday, at her rally in Washington Square that attracted 20,000 New Yorkers, Warren spoke movingly and at length about the 1911 Triangle Fire, about the 146 Triangle workers who died, and about the brilliant efforts, led by Frances Perkins, who later served as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Labor, to prevent more such factory disasters — and to improve conditions overall for America’s workers.

Pete Buttigieg

Mayor Pete’s platform on labor, A New Rising Tide, is one of the very best things I’ve read from any modern-day politician on worker issues. He sees much injustice in the workplace: that Uber misclassifies workers as independent contractors to deny them basic worker protections, that the McDonald’s franchising model undermines workers’ ability to unionize, that Google hires so many temps and independent contractors to undermine workers’ bargaining power. “The hard truth is that while the economy changed, workers’ voices” have been “systematically silenced,” Buttigieg writes. “Our economy has been tilted towards the wealthy and away from the middle and working class because the people in power designed our laws and policies that way.”

Buttigieg’s platform would raise the federal minimum wage to $15, end right-to-work laws, give workers the power to unionize through card check, guarantee paid sick leave and family leave, ban the use of permanent replacement workers, and take strong steps to curb corporations’ often-intimidating sway over unionization elections.

Union officials in Indiana say that Buttigieg, though just 37, is not a Johnny-come-lately in supporting labor. He sided with labor unions when Indiana Republicans sought to repeal the state’s “common construction wage law,” which helped assure higher wages for construction workers. Buttigieg also signed a labor-backed “responsible bidding” ordinance that requires businesses seeking city contracts with South Bend to disclose OSHA violations.

“He’s been fantastic,” Jim Gardner, an official with the Operating Engineers union told In These Times. Buttigieg’s unsuccessful campaign for state treasurer in 2010 was run out of the offices of South Bend’s building trades unions.

B

Joe Biden

Biden was the first candidate to secure a union endorsement, receiving it from the 320,000-member International Association of Fire Fighters. Its longtime president, Harold Schaitberger, lavished praise on his friend, saying, “He’s one of the staunchest advocates for working families. He knows that a strong middle class means a strong America.”

Nonetheless, Biden faces many questions from unions. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and while President Obama was considered pro-union, he negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Biden supported that agreement, and many unions deride it to this day, even after Trump pulled out of the agreement.

At his campaign’s official kickoff event at a Teamsters hall, Biden trumpeted, “I make no apologies. I am a union man.” Some union leaders were nonetheless upset that on the day Biden announced his candidacy — three days before the Teamsters hall event — he spoke at a high-dollar Philadelphia fundraiser organized by a senior executive at Comcast. Patrick Eiding, the president of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, complained that the “first place he goes” is to a Comcast executive’s. “No connection with labor,” Eiding said. “It was a little disturbing.” One labor scholar, writing in May, said he could find only two instances when Biden appeared on a picket line, “once in Iowa, during his 1987 presidential campaign and just this month (May) in Boston,” backing the Stop and Shop supermarket strikers.

As a senator, Biden supported organized labor’s No. 1 priority, the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it easier to unionize by, among other things, giving unions a right to use card check. At a forum sponsored by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in August, Biden spoke robustly for labor, decrying “an all-out war on suppressing wages to increase profits.”

The labor platform that Biden has sketched out so far is short, indeed abbreviated. He supports a $15 minimum wage, curbing noncompete clauses, easing occupational licensing requirements, and making it easier for workers to unionize and bargain (without spelling out how). None of this is the fight-like-hell stuff one might expect from someone who characterizes himself as a champion of labor.

B

Cory Booker

Booker has pushed some daring, unorthodox ideas to help workers. One is the Worker Dividend Act, a Senate bill he sponsored that would help workers share in a company’s profits by requiring corporations that do stock buybacks to pay their employees either an amount equal to the lesser of the value of the buyback or half of all profits above $250 million. Booker has also proposed a job guarantee that would give 15 cities or rural areas federal money so they can guarantee jobs to everyone who wants one. Economists say this pilot measure would go far to help marginal, struggling workers.

Booker has a reputation for being close to Wall Street — he defended Bain Capital when Barack Obama attacked it during the 2012 campaign, and received $2.2 million from the securities and investment industry, more than any other senator, during the 2013 to 2014 election cycle. Nonetheless, his record on worker rights and unions is progressive — he backs a $15 minimum wage and bills that would make it easier to unionize, including Sanders’s Workplace Democracy Act and the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Last Wednesday, Booker beefed up his labor bona fides by releasing an elaborate platform called “Opportunity and Justice for Workers.” In it, Booker says, “For most people in this country, our economy is broken.” His platform calls for sweeping new laws to make it easier to unionize, raise workers’ wages, and ease work-life balance.

Teachers’ unions have long been uneasy with Booker because he championed vouchers and charter schools as Newark’s mayor. Labor leaders complain that these moves siphon money from traditional public schools and undermine teachers’ unions. The Newark Teachers Union opposed Booker’s 2010 reelection as mayor. But Booker argues that that teachers’ union often obstructed moves to improve educational quality in Newark’s struggling schools. At a union forum in August, Booker said he would prioritize public schools and noted that the New Jersey Education Association, his state’s largest teachers’ union, had endorsed him as a Senate candidate.

B

Julián Castro

Castro has been the most outspoken candidate on behalf of immigrants, but his platform has been thin on worker and labor issues. (Vox’s labor reporter wrote that Castro “probably has the weakest labor platform” on worker issues.) He met with striking University of California medical workers and attended a meeting of campus workers at Stanford, his alma mater, to show support before they began contract negotiations with the university. (California’s early primary is especially important for Castro’s prospects.) He has spoken at various union audiences, but he hasn’t made lifting up workers a central theme of his campaign. Castro backs numerous measures that would help working families, including universal child care, paid family leave, and a $15 minimum wage.

B

Kamala Harris

Unlike Sanders, Booker, Buttigieg, and O’Rourke, Kamala Harris has not adopted a plan that shouts to the world that she is eager to expand unions. She has taken a different, sometimes innovative course. She has trumpeted a plan that would lift the pay of the nation’s public school teachers by $13,500 on average, a move that has delighted two of the nation’s largest and most powerful unions: the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. In July, Harris introduced legislation for a National Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights, which would help the nation’s nannies, housekeepers and caregivers by giving them minimum wage and overtime protections and paid time off and requiring their employers to give them written employment contracts. To reduce income inequality, Harris has introduced a bill called LIFT the Middle Class Act that would give a refundable tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to households earning under $100,000 annually.

Harris uses social media to promote various union causes, such as organizing UCLA’s medical residents. But she has not made battling for unions and workers a signature part of her campaign the way Sanders and Warren have and has not issued a detailed labor platform.

B

Beto O’Rourke

O’Rourke’s labor platform, A 21st Century Labor Contract, is an impressive, thoughtful document. He calls for lifting workers collectively by expanding unions and their bargaining clout, while also calling for lifting workers individually, legislating new worker rights, by, for instance, guaranteeing seven paid sick days.

In his labor platform, O’Rourke proposes a nationwide law to let all government workers and farm workers unionize, and doing likewise for all frontline supervisors and independent contractors. (Letting frontline supervisors join unions would greatly expand union power, especially during strikes; letting independent contractors unionize and bargain would be a powerful tool for gig workers.) O’Rourke would adopt nationwide rules making it far easier for Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig workers to be considered employees — a move that would extend minimum wage and overtime coverage to them as well as protections against sexual harassment and race discrimination. O’Rourke would establish government-appointed wage boards that would set, and presumably improve, wages and conditions for industries with low union membership — for instance, fast-food restaurants, nail salons, carwashes.

Although from conservative Texas, O’Rourke has forcefully called for raising the minimum wage to $15 so workers don’t have to juggle two and three jobs. Some labor advocates point out, with chagrin, that when O’Rourke was on the El Paso City Council in 2010, he questioned whether police and firefighters should have a right to bargain collectively. At the time, El Paso faced a large budget deficit due to the recession, and city officials wanted municipal unions to agree to defer their raises. O’Rourke was angry that the police union continued to insist on wage increases that he said amounted to 8 percent. At one point, O’Rourke even asked the city’s attorney whether there was a way to eliminate the police union. In a 2011 interview, he said, “I do not think it is in the community’s best interests, certainly not in the taxpayers’ best interests, to have collective bargaining by the police and firefighters.”

But more recently, O’Rourke has championed the right of all public-sector workers, including police officers to unionize, telling a union meeting in Houston in July, “We’ve seen the devastation in our communities and in our states when unions are not allowed to organize … As president, I want to make sure that we guarantee the right to organize for every educator and public servant in every state.”

B-

Amy Klobuchar

Klobuchar has “one of the vaguest labor platforms” of the Democratic candidates, Vox wrote recently. She often tells audiences that she is the daughter of a unionized teacher and newspaperman and granddaughter of a unionized iron ore miner. She says that “as President she’ll stand up against attempts to weaken unions,” adding, without offering details, that she wants to reform labor laws, protect collective bargaining rights and roll back right-to-work laws. In her first 100 days as president, she says, she will issue executive orders requiring federal contractors to pay at least $15 an hour, scrapping Trump’s rollback of overtime protections, and banning companies from requiring low-wage workers to sign noncompete clauses.

Despite her impressive rhetorical and debating skills, Klobuchar is not much of a fighter for workers — her focus is usually elsewhere — and this from a lawmaker whose state has a famous farm-labor tradition and has sent several warriors for workers to the Senate, most recently Paul Wellstone. Some former Klobuchar aides have said she can be an abusive boss. Based on interviews with ex-staffers, The New York Times wrote that Klobuchar was “not just demanding but often dehumanizing” and “not merely a tough boss,” but “the steward of a work environment colored by volatility, highhandedness and distrust.” Considering this, that’s all the more reason Klobuchar should be working doubly hard to show she is a champion of workers.

C+

Andrew Yang

Yang talks as if his universal basic income program (which would guarantee $1,000 a month to every citizen over the age of 18) would be a boon for America’s workers. He says it would be a welcome supplement for low-wage and part-time workers and a lifeline to laid-off workers, helping them avoid misery and easing the pressure on them to take whatever job is offered them, no matter how low the pay. He says UBI would increase workers’ bargaining power “because a guaranteed, unconditional income gives them leverage to say no to exploitative wages and abusive working conditions” UBI would help workers who are on strike, Yang says, by enabling them to hold out longer and demand a better contract.

To my mind, Yang’s single issue — Yang calls it a “Freedom Dividend” — hardly begins to address, much less fix, the biggest problems American workers face: soaring income inequality and the overall decline of worker power. Some experts argue that UBI would encourage some employers to lower workers’ pay.

In a Labor Day blog post last year, Yang seemed to have only just discovered the importance of labor unions and collective worker action — he was marveling at the historic achievements of Walter Reuther, the UAW, and other unions, and how they played a pivotal role in building the world’s largest and richest middle class. In Yang’s platform, there is little acknowledgement of what collective action or unions have achieved and can achieve for American workers. (He inaccurately says union membership has dropped 70 percent from its peak; it’s dropped 30 percent.)

Many people I respect support UBI, especially to help the millions of workers who some predict will lose their jobs because of AI, robots, and other new technologies. I nonetheless wonder how will laid-off workers survive on $12,000 a year, especially when some supporters of UBI have called for weakening various parts of the social safety net. As far as I can tell, Yang — who is very eloquent in discussing the threat that new technologies pose to workers — has hardly discussed a key issue: the importance of giving workers (and not just corporate executives, technology gurus, and Silicon Valley investors) a voice in what new technologies will mean for workers and the economy. I fear that UBI, combined with technology-induced layoffs, will create an underclass of the long-term unemployed scraping by on $12,000 a year, and an overclass of very wealthy executives and investors who own and control the new technologies.

Donald Trump

Trump campaigned as a champion of workers, but his administration is unarguably the most anti-worker, anti-union administration since Ronald Reagan — and is arguably even more anti-worker. Trump and his appointees have taken dozens of actions to hurt workers. They have rolled back overtime protections extended to millions of workers and scrapped the “fiduciary rule” requiring Wall Street firms to act in workers’ best interests in handling 401k’s. His administration has reduced the number of OSHA inspectors and weakened safety requirements for oil-rig workers. Trump has made it easier to award federal contracts to corporations that have repeatedly violated minimum wage and overtime laws, race and sex discrimination laws, and laws protecting workers’ ability to unionize. His administration has hurt LGBTQ+ workers by urging the Supreme Court to rule that they are not covered by federal anti-discrimination laws.

Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, has long been corporate America’s top gun, its leading lawyer, in seeking to quash many new regulations protecting workers. Trump’s Supreme Court appointee, Neil Gorsuch, provided the pivotal vote in important cases that weakened public-sector unions and let corporations prohibit workers from bringing class actions, making it far harder for millions of Americans to vindicate their workplace rights. Trump’s appointees to the National Labor Relations Board have been extremely aggressive in seeking to weaken unions and obstruct union organizing – for instance, declaring that Uber and Lyft drivers shouldn’t be classified as employees, making it far harder to unionize franchises like McDonald’s, and vastly reducing the ability of contracted-out workers to picket employers.

The only reason Trump deserves an F-plus and not an F is that he had made good on one big promise to workers — his vow to fight on trade. He has pushed to revamp NAFTA and confront China. But in renegotiating NAFTA, Trump failed to do the one thing labor unions said was most needed: to make sure that NAFTA’s enforcement mechanisms had teeth so that Mexican workers could push for higher wages and to unionize without being suppressed or jailed.

Moreover, Trump has hugely mishandled his trade war with China. Any child can tell you that if you’re going to pick a fight with a powerful adversary, you want your friends lined up at your side. But Trump launched his trade war against China, the world’s second largest economic power, without getting important allies like Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Australia to fight along with us. As a result of Trump’s unilateral trade war, China is feeling much less pressure and America’s workers, farmers, consumers, and corporations are getting battered. Trump deserves a failing grade for the way he has so badly bungled his trade war.

With just over a week to go before qualifying ends for the fourth Democratic presidential candidate debate, to be held in October, the Democratic National Committee has announced new, higher qualifications for its November debate (place and time still TBD). Since every candidate who qualified for the September event in Houston automatically made the cut for October, this could be the first “winnowing” measure in a good while.

The thresholds for “grassroots fundraising” didn’t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states. While the new thresholds could distort fundraising efforts for more marginal candidates, it’s unlikely any of those on the October stage will fall off in November because of fundraising — unless they just run out of money and drop out of the race (as Cory Booker’s campaign has said might happen to him if it doesn’t reach its third-quarter money goals).

Nor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems. There have been only three qualifying debates so far: two national surveys (NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Fox News) and one from Iowa (Ann Selzer’s poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom). Booker has met the new threshold in two of them; Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, and Andrew Yang have met it in one. October debate qualifier Tom Steyer and possible qualifier Tulsi Gabbard haven’t met any so far; nor have the other candidates who failed to qualify for September.

The new higher but narrower qualifying option for early-state polls is probably tailor-made for Steyer, who can just pick a state or two and spend tens of millions of dollars on ads there. It could also help Klobuchar, who’s predictably doing better in Iowa than she is nationally or in other early states.

All in all, the new qualifying thresholds are mostly of interest to those who are shrieking in anguish at the likely reappearance of a second debate night in October. The odds are reasonably good that at least one or two October qualifiers won’t make it past the higher thresholds and will put the debate stage far beyond reach of the bottom-feeders who stubbornly refuse to drop out. Maybe for its next debate, in December, the DNC could help us out by administering a lie-detector test to see which candidates really believe they have a prayer of finishing in the top six or so in Iowa."

Her idea was ambitious and controversial, but Sanders’s idea goes much, much farther.

AD

Warren’s plan is relatively straightforward: Tax all assets above $50 million at 2 percent per year and all assets above $1 billion at 3 percent per year. Sanders’s plan not only kicks in earlier, it includes more gradations that tax the mega-rich much more heavily. Here’s how it would work:

1 percent tax on wealth over $32 million

2 percent tax on wealth from $50 million to $250 million

3 percent tax on wealth from $250 million to $500 million

4 percent tax on wealth from $500 million to $1 billion

5 percent tax on wealth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion

6 percent tax on wealth from $2.5 billion to $5 billion

7 percent tax on wealth from $5 billion to $10 billion

8 percent tax on wealth above $10 billion

If you’re one of the 600 or so billionaires in the country, this tax would hit you much harder than Warren’s would; on that 11th billion, you’d have to pay $30 million under Warren’s plan but $80 million under Sanders’s plan. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, Sanders’s tax would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, significantly more than Warren’s version.

For Sanders, the goal isn’t just to get the overclass to pay their fair share; he wants to cut them down to size. “Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years,” the plan says, “which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class.”

While the right might despise wealth taxes for ideological reasons, some liberals dislike them for practical reasons. In Europe, a dozen countries had wealth taxes a few decades ago, but now that number has been reduced to three: Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Countries decided that the rich found it too easy to avoid the tax, in many cases just moving out of the country, and they wound up raising less revenue than the governments had hoped.

Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal economist and a wealth tax skeptic, predicted to me that if a tax of this sort was in the offing, you’d see billionaires renounce their citizenship before it took effect or find other creative ways to avoid the tax.

“If Warren and Sanders really want to crack down on inequality, they should address the market structures that generate inequality, such as patent and copyright monopolies, a bloated financial industry and a corrupt corporate governance structure,” Baker said. “Both have good proposals on these issues, but a wealth tax is likely to be economically wasteful and a political embarrassment.”

AD

AD

Other economists disagree, however. Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities offered me this qualified endorsement:

Given the extent of wealth concentration and the tax sheltering that protects it, it’s clear to me and most other progressives that the time has come to make a serious run at taxing wealth. I like the simplicity of Warren’s approach relative to Bernie’s, but given that any such tax is and will be a tremendous political reach from where we stand today, the important thing is to get these ideas bouncing around the echo chamber.

Both Sanders and Warren answer the criticism about the super-rich avoiding the tax by saying they’ll make sure the tax is free of loopholes and beef up the IRS budget for enforcement.

In fact, revitalizing the IRS should be a priority for any Democrat, whether they pass a wealth tax or not, since Republicans have spent decades eviscerating the agency, with the result that it’s incapable of forcing the ultrawealthy to pay what they owe right now.

On the politics: Getting either plan through Congress would be a long shot at best, but if nothing else, this discussion can expand the debate around taxes. Sanders would probably argue that fundamental change starts with getting people to consider ideas that some find radical.

AD

AD

At a time of grotesque inequality, wouldn’t it be good for Democrats to debate how much we should be making plutocrats contribute? Republicans will inevitably argue that billionaires should not have to be burdened by contributing to the country that enabled them to accumulate their vast holdings in the first place, a stance that won’t do them any favors with the voting public.

As enthusiastically as some Fox personalities will make that case (they’re already doing it), I say it’s the last thing President Trump would like to talk about. That’s especially true if Sanders or Warren becomes the nominee, since they’d run campaigns centered on the idea that wealthy people have rigged the system in their favor. Trump’s faux-populism only works if there isn’t a more genuine kind voters can compare and contrast.

But this proposal is one more signal from Sanders that he’s going to go farther in what he proposes than any other Democrat. It might not help him win the nomination, but it will certainly enable him to keep influencing the policy debate.

The dam is bursting, the floodgates are opening, the horse is out of the barn. Choose whichever metaphor you want — the point is that news of President Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden has supercharged Democratic support for impeachment proceedings — to the point that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday afternoon.

What stands out about the latest crop of converts to the cause is how many are from swing congressional districts — the kinds of places where bringing charges against the president may be a far riskier political gamble than in safe Democratic areas, given that impeachment has consistently lacked majority support in national polls. The lack of enthusiasm from representatives in these districts is one reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been so unenthusiastic about triggering the procedure over Donald Trump’s alleged obstruction in the Russia investigation.

But the Ukraine story seems to be different. Here’s a running list of lawmakers joining the impeachment push.

House Democrats Newly in Favor of Impeachment

At least 20 House Democrats have expressed support for impeachment for the first time in just the past two days, bringing the total number of representatives on board to 174 Democrats out of 235, according to Politico’s running counter.

On Monday, Congresswoman Angie Craig, who represents a Minnesota district Trump carried by a point, said she is onboard with impeachment.

Later that night, seven freshman Democrats wrote a Washington Post op-ed in which they deemed Trump’s actions a possible threat to national security. Four of them — Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria, Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin, and New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill — represent districts Trump carried in 2016.

Here's how Trump did in the Impeachment 7 op-ed writers' districts in 2016:



Spanberger VA-7 Trump +7

Slotkin MI-8 Trump +7

Luria VA-2 Trump +4

Sherrill NJ-11 Trump +1

Cisneros CA-39 Clinton +9

Crow CO-6 Clinton +9

Houlahan PA-6 Clinton +10



AVG: Clinton +1 — Domenico Montanaro (@DomenicoNPR) September 24, 2019

On Tuesday morning, New York’s Antonio Delgado joined the impeachment bandwagon. Delgado defeated incumbent Republican John Faso in an upstate district that voted for Trump by more than six points.

Some lawmakers appeared to be shifting on impeachment, but didn’t endorse it outright — yet. Texas’s Colin Allred said if the Trump administration doesn’t turn over the full report of the whistle-blower who alerted the government to Trump’s alleged misconduct, he would support impeachment. In 2018, Allred defeated a longtime Republican incumbent in a district that had voted for Hillary Clinton by just two points.

Later, Texas representative Lizzie Fletcher announced her support as well. Fletcher’s district narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016 but hadn’t been represented by a Democrat in Congress since 1967.

The facts we have learned recently are matters of utmost importance for our national security, country, and Constitution. The House should act swiftly to investigate and should be prepared to use the remedy exclusively in its power: impeachment.



See my full statement here: pic.twitter.com/xho0DlD107 — Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (@RepFletcher) September 24, 2019

Two representatives from Nevada, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, followed suit.

Lee’s district narrowly voted for Trump in 2016.

Haley Stevens of Michigan, who won a district that Trump carried by five points, wrote that “if investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offenses that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Also on Tuesday, civil-rights icon John Lewis announced his support for impeachment from the House floor.

Breaking. Rep. John Lewis just now on the House floor: ""I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy."" — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 24, 2019

Other Democrats who joined the herd include New York’s Joe Morelle and Michigan’s Debbie Dingell, Tennessee’s Jim Cooper, and Florida’s Donna Shalala and Lois Frankel, Pennsylvania’s Susan Wild, and Iowa’s Cindy Axne.

As a rough measure of swing-district support, just five Democrats who represent districts Trump won in 2016 had endorsed impeachment before this week, according to Politico; now that number is up to 13 and is likely to rise.

These lawmakers’ decisions were apparently not triggered by House leadership in any way, making them all the more significant.

As one Dem operative notes, this is the opposite of how Hill votes usually pile up: there is NO whipping from leadership, it’s rank and file members coordinating w one another, swallowing and stepping out there. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

While most of the action was in the House on Tuesday, the Democrats’ second-in-command in the Senate, Dick Durbin, joined in as well.

Today, I am calling for the initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives of President Donald Trump. — Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) September 24, 2019

Non-Democrats in Favor of Impeachment

So far, only one non-Democrat in Congress supports impeachment: Michigan representative Justin Amash, who switched his party registration from Republican to Independent earlier this year after declaring that Trump should be investigated. On Tuesday, he reiterated his call to action in an effort to nudge his erstwhile Republican colleagues.

Just do what is right. Stop waiting for others to act first. Take responsibility for yourself and set an example. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 24, 2019

There is no sign that any House Republicans will join Amash.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has appeared surprisingly eager to cooperate with Democrats, at least on the narrow matter of getting to the bottom of what the whistleblower actually said.

MCCONNELL has hotlined the resolution calling for the release of the whistleblower report. Schumer asking for unanimous consent for its passsage. — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019

One Republican, Mitt Romney, has expressed serious consternation over Trump’s behavior.

If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019

When asked about impeachment on Tuesday — hours after Trump had mocked him on Twitter — Romney didn’t rule it out.

Romney on impeachment: “it’s early to be having those conversations. There’s so much we don’t know” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 24, 2019

Some other Republicans, like Marco Rubio, have downplayed the allegations against Trump.

Democratic Presidential Candidates in Favor of Impeachment

Of the major presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, and Tom Steyer have previously called on Congress to impeach Trump. Pete Buttigieg has said Trump “deserves impeachment” but has stopped short of endorsing it. Bernie Sanders had also avoided a full-throated endorsement until Tuesday:

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.



Enough is enough.



I hope the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House will begin the impeachment process. pic.twitter.com/WHth62v5br — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Joe Biden, who is at the center of the Ukraine scandal, has so far resisted calls to impeach. But on Tuesday, he said that if the Trump administration does not cooperate with Democrats’ demands for full access to the whistle-blower’s complaint, he’s on board.

Joe Biden: If Pres. Trump doesn't give Congress documents on Ukraine, Trump will leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy ""of his own making.”



""We know who Donald Trump is. It is time to let the world know who we are."" — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 24, 2019

Other candidates are reaffirming their belief that Trump should face charges.

The House must impeach. It must start today. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 24, 2019

Enough. It’s time to impeach. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 24, 2019

If we allow the president to get away with the crimes he’s committed, then we will set the precedent that some people are above the law. And then, this democracy will be lost to us forever.



It’s time for Speaker Pelosi and the House to do their job. — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 24, 2019

We knew nearly 2 years ago that Donald Trump had passed the threshold for impeachment. Over 8 million Americans showed up and signed our petition. It is my sincere hope that today is the day the House Democrats stand up for democracy and move to impeach this lawless president. — Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) September 24, 2019"

After a temporary hiccup, Iowa Democrats are back on track with a proposal to make their presidential caucuses comply with the national party’s requirements to provide more accessibility to voters who struggle to attend the traditional multi-hour fixed-time-and-location events. A “satellite caucuses” add-on has been unanimously approved by the Democratic National Committee’s Rules and Bylaws panel, which a few weeks ago killed plans from Iowa and Nevada to hold a “virtual caucus” by phone.

Virtual causes were ruled out because of fears about such a system’s clear vulnerability to hacking. Other options Iowa Democrats considered (e.g., mail-in ballots or in-person early voting) would have taken the caucuses too far in the direction of primaries, which might have triggered New Hampshire’s law requiring it to hold the first primary in the nation. Iowa and Nevada could simply have asked for, and probably have secured, a waiver for 2020 letting them go ahead with their past practices. But for Iowans paranoid about losing their first spot in the line of nominating contests, acknowledging an inability to make the caucuses more accessible seemed to give too much ammunition to those who want to blow up the whole calendar with its privileged early states (in order, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina).

The “satellite caucuses” approach is the “accessibility reform” that would least disrupt the traditional system. Here’s how the Iowa Democratic Party describes it:

• The 2020 satellite caucus proposal will allow for additional caucus locations on February 3 to expand participation for people who cannot attend their in-person precinct caucus … • Iowa Democrats can apply to hold a satellite site at places like factories, group homes, or community gathering places, to better accommodate people who cannot attend their in-person caucus. This option will be especially useful for shift workers, Iowans with disabilities, Iowans serving overseas, and students. • The IDP will create a special satellite-caucus review committee that will review applications and determine approval … • The results will be reported using the same method as precinct caucus locations. The satellite caucuses will create one additional county in each congressional district.

These satellite events will be live, not virtual, and will have to take place on the same day as the regular caucuses, February 3, though some provision will be made for variations in the exact starting times. Although giving virtual caucuses (depending on participation) ten percent of the state-delegate-equivalents awards, by which victory in the Iowa Caucuses is measured, had been contemplated, the satellite system will probably be less significant in affecting the outcome. What it most seems to resemble is the system already employed by Nevada in 2016 to accommodate casino and hotel workers who were on duty when the regular caucuses were held:

The Nevada Democratic Party set up six caucus locations on the Las Vegas strip to accommodate shift workers at the hotels and casinos so they don’t have to travel to their home precincts to participate.

Presumably, national party approval of Iowa’s satellite-caucus proposal will make it easy for Nevada to reuse or expand its own 2016 system.

As for Iowa, the satellite caucuses will create an interesting organizational challenge for the various presidential campaigns — and for pollsters and journalists, too. Participation in the new Ann Selzer poll of Iowa, which is creating a buzz in political circles because it shows Elizabeth Warren in the lead, did not mention any options beyond the traditional caucuses (a June Selzer poll had been based on the availability of virtual caucuses “to take place online or by phone on several days leading up to the traditional, in-person caucus meetings on February 3”). It’s possible that Selzer’s sample had been too large in June and too small in September; that’s entirely unclear. But at least now everyone can get onto the same page between now and November.

Sanders would hit more people with the tax and would also significantly increase how much it would take from the very wealthiest, following a pattern in which he has sought to stake out the leftward boundary of the Democratic Party when it comes to policy proposals.

Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.

The announcement Tuesday highlighted the country’s striking divide over economic policy. Two of the three top-polling candidates for the Democratic nomination are now advocating a sweeping change in the way wealth is allocated in the United States, embracing policies that have not been so prominently discussed since the 1960s.

AD

Under President Trump, meanwhile, the Republicans have passed a far-reaching tax cut plan that economists say will dramatically expand the deficit. This comes less than a decade after the tea party angrily seized the nation’s attention, and a measure of power within the GOP, with a low-spending, anti-deficit message.

AD

On Tuesday, Sanders concluded a two-day swing through Iowa counties that Barack Obama won and then went for Trump. He’s dubbed the trip his “Bernie Beats Trump” tour, presenting himself as the most electable Democratic candidate against the president.

But Sanders has struggled to recapture the magic of his near-win in this first caucus state in 2016. A recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren leading with 22 percent. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, and Sanders was running third at 11 percent.

AD

Sanders and Warren have been battling for supremacy in the Democratic Party’s liberal wing, issuing dueling proposals on a number of topics that would reshape the nation’s safety net and significantly expand the role of government.

Their proposals include making public colleges and universities tuition-free, wiping away much or all of the student loan debt in the country, and enacting a Medicare-for-all health-care system.

AD

The plans are estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars, raising questions about how they would be paid for. Warren for months has pointed to her wealth tax, and Sanders’s new proposal gives him a similar revenue source to cite.

AD

Sanders aides noted that the senator has spoken of a wealth tax for decades, including proposing it as a possible funding source for his Medicare-for-all plan. In 1997, Sanders wrote that it was “time, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.”

However, there is no guarantee that Warren or Sanders, if elected, could push such a far-reaching new tax through Congress.

When it comes to wealth taxes, the impact on the nation’s biggest fortunes would be profound. Bill Gates, estimated to have $107 billion in wealth, would under Sanders’s plan pay at least an additional $8 billion annually to the federal government. Sanders’s campaign says the wealth of billionaires overall would be halved under his proposal.

AD

AD

The plan to tax the wealthy could pay for some of Sanders’s plans but fall short of covering other parts of his agenda. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California at Berkeley estimate Sanders’s plan would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, although conservatives have said such estimates overstate how much can be raised through a wealth tax.

Sanders has unveiled a $2.5 trillion plan to end homelessness and create 10 million new housing units and a $1.7 trillion plan to cancel all student debt in the United States; those two initiatives alone would come close to equaling the money raised by the wealth tax. The campaign said the tax would be used to fund the housing plan, pay for universal child care and help finance Medicare-for-all.

The senator has proposed a $30 trillion Medicare-for-all health-care system that would eliminate families’ health-care spending, which Sanders has said would be paid for with higher middle-class taxes, as well as ­taxes on the wealthy.

AD

AD

The biggest difference with Warren’s plan is that Sanders’s would more directly target the fortunes of billionaires and multi­billionaires.

Zucman noted on Twitter that Sanders’s plan “would make it much harder to remain a multibillionaire durably.” But he said that if Sanders’s tax had been enacted in the 1980s, billionaires’ share of the national wealth would still have increased.

That means Sanders’s plan would stop short of a “maximum income” plan favored by some on the left, although Sanders has come out in favor of that as a long-term goal, telling the New York Times, “I don’t think that billionaires should exist.”

That position follows months of debates in left-leaning circles over whether Democrats should push taxes high enough to eliminate all billion-dollar fortunes, an idea championed, for example, by an aide to first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

With that big poll now public, here are some overarching questions for the broader 2020 race.

1. How much trouble is Bernie Sanders in (especially in Iowa)?

The big news this weekend was that Warren had overtaken Biden (albeit still within the margin of error) in the new poll. But that wasn’t all that far-fetched given Warren’s ascendancy.

Perhaps the second biggest piece of news in the poll was that Sanders’s Iowa troubles appear to be very real. We had seen some evidence of this before, but now it seems safe to say it. Of the last four live-caller polls in Iowa, Sanders is at 11 percent in this one and 9 percent in the three previous ones. He does better in online polls, but every high-quality poll has him lagging behind his national showing.

AD

AD

Why is that important? Because he nearly won the state in 2016, yet early signs suggest he’s not even an option for many voters there. Another poll last week showed more likely caucusgoers had ruled out supporting him (46 percent) than were considering it (43 percent.)

It’s also important because national polls still have them running neck and neck for second place. Given that both Sanders and Warren hail from a state that neighbors New Hampshire (Sanders from Vermont and Warren from Massachusetts), the one who finishes better in Iowa would seem to have the inside track ahead of the Granite State’s primary.

And if one of them drops out at that point, it could reshape the race.

AD

2. How will Elizabeth Warren wear?

Warren is the one candidate with demonstrated momentum pretty much throughout the 2020 race. Being in the lead in Iowa would seem to be the culmination of all that.

AD

But she’s thus far largely avoided her opponents’ fire, and that’s starting to change. She has also in the past struggled to deal with the controversy over her past claim of Native American heritage, muddling through efforts to put it behind her. Then there is the electability issue — however fair — when it comes to Democrats nominating another polarizing, intellectual woman, this time a former Harvard University professor from Massachusetts.

It’s too easy to caricature Warren as an unelectable extremist. But Democratic voters are completely preoccupied with nominating someone — anyone — who can beat Trump. The same new Iowa poll shows twice as many emphasized that (63 percent) as emphasized agreement on the issues (31 percent).

AD

They seem to like Warren in a way they don’t like the others; her main task is persuading them to vote with their heart while believing in their minds that it will work out. The good news for her is she seems to be doing that, at least in Iowa, where she’s tied with Biden at 22 percent with electability-first voters.

AD

We’ll see if that holds — and if the rest of the country begins to agree.

3. Is Joe Biden’s electability edge ironclad?

Related to the point above: If Warren is the candidate of Democrats’ hearts, Biden is the choice of their minds. Nearly every poll shows he is viewed as the most electable. So if Democrats just want to win, he should be able to stick around.

AD

But just as we should challenge our assumptions about Warren’s electability deficit, we should challenge them about Biden’s electability edge.

Part of that is because Biden is the most well-known candidate in the race who is also easiest to see in the role of a president — in large part because he was right next to one for eight years. We shouldn’t discount how much this is because he’s simply the biggest known quantity in the field and thus makes the most sense for casual voters.

AD

It’s also worth questioning whether he’ll maintain that perception. Biden’s previous presidential runs haven’t gone well, and there have already been plenty of stumbles early in his 2020 campaign. It’s one thing to be the vice president whom people can see being president; it’s another to be the candidate who can’t quite shoot straight. If he can’t be as compelling or as steady as Warren or other candidates, perhaps Democrats will start to adjust their preconceptions about how he might fare in the general election.

AD

4. Is Biden’s black support sustainable?

A big reason Biden continues to lead in national polling — even as he doesn’t do as well in Iowa and New Hampshire — is black voters.

Even after tangling with Harris on busing and criticism from another black candidate, Sen. Cory Booker, about Biden’s comments about working with segregationist senators, Biden is still above 40 percent with African Americans in most polls. A recent poll of the South Carolina primary showed him taking 51 percent of that demographic there.

AD

This demographic advantage was huge for Hillary Clinton in 2016; Sanders’s inability to appeal to black voters basically made him unelectable in a party whose nominating process they play such a major role in (around one-quarter of all voters).

AD

As Philip Bump has written, black voters may not be the silver bullet for Biden that they were for Clinton. But it’s his most loyal demographic in the 2020 race right now, and it’s the one keeping him in the lead nationally. If he can maintain that through the early states and especially heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday, he’ll stand a good chance. If he can’t, the math becomes much more difficult.

5. What’s the deal with Pete Buttigieg?

We’ve talked about the first three candidates in that Iowa poll. The fourth one, though, is a major X-Factor.

AD

The new Iowa poll shows Buttigieg has the second-highest favorable rating in Iowa (behind Warren), at 69 percent. He also has the lowest unfavorable rating of anyone (Warren included), at 13 percent. People really like the guy. And so do donors, judging by Buttigieg’s surprise win in the second-quarter fundraising race.

AD

But the same Iowa voters who really like him also still have him in fourth place, at 9 percent — behind candidates they don’t like as much.

The easy and perhaps overly simplistic explanation is that maybe they like the South Bend, Ind., mayor — and quite a bit — but that they can’t necessarily see the boyish 37-year-old as their president or as being capable of beating Trump. An alternate explanation is that they are warm to him even if they haven’t quite been convinced. That suggests they could eventually come around, which is pretty much all he could ask at this point, given where he started this race.

There has been a lot of talk about how Buttigieg maybe hasn’t delivered on that fundraising. He seems to have plenty of upside, though. And the fact that he’s not alienating key voters is significant.

Warren’s campaign declined to specify the spending breakdown between digital and television ads, but said the focus would be on digital first, with airtime reserved for television ads over the next few months. The ads focus on a familiar theme from Warren’s core message: that she’s not afraid to take on government corruption.

“It will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns,” campaign manager Roger Lau said in the Tuesday email.

The foray into television advertising marks a shift for Warren, who eschewed TV ads in her 2018 reelection bid for the Senate. It reflects the challenge of running a nationwide presidential campaign, rather than focusing on a single state where the candidate is already well-known.

The announcement comes as Warren is moving toward the top of polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, though the race remains fluid. But her campaign is also seeking to show it’s building strength in states that are not in the first wave of primaries and caucuses.

State directors and organizers will be hired in places like Minnesota, Texas and Florida, the memo said, adding that the moves were designed in part to help Democrats win downballot races.

“We’re putting boots on the ground in places like Michigan and Minnesota, which will help flip state legislatures to Democratic control,” Lau wrote. “And we’re continuing to build the future of our party by investing in states like Texas and Florida.”

Warren has recently gained momentum in the packed Democratic primary field. Last week, she addressed her largest crowd yet — about 20,000 in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park — in a speech that hailed the political power of female-led organizing.

Last week, a poll from the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom showed Warren about even with former vice president Joe Biden in Iowa, while a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday showed she had made significant gains in New Hampshire since May.

Wall Street is sounding the alarm over Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s rise in the Democratic presidential race, as investors start to grapple with the possibility the industry scourge secures her party's nomination.

One investor joked that the stock market wouldn't even open if the Massachusetts senator became president; a segment on CNBC featured the idea that married couples could get divorced rather than be subjected to Warren's ""wealth tax.""

For now, the rising nerves are mostly evident in chatter. There's an emerging consensus that a Warren presidency would hurt the stock market -- yet there’s little evidence that investors are pricing in the risk.

""From a pure markets perspective, a Warren nomination hardly seemed 'priced in,'"" Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group writes. He offers a few theories why that's the case: The election remains far away; Warren could be seen as a weaker Trump foe; or that Warren will moderate her pitch if she secures the nomination. ""In any event, buckle up.""

Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for AGF Investments, dismissed the possibility of market fallout from the firestorm in Washington over reports Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — and the renewed impeachment talk it has touched off.

“What could affect the markets, however, is what we have warned about for months: the growing possibility that [Warren] may be the Democrats’ nominee,” Valliere writes.

Hedge fund titan Leon Cooperman went further. “They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,” he said to the crowd at the Delivering Alpha Conference, apparently joking.

He later clarified the comment in a CNBC interview, saying the market would open, just “a hell of a lot lower,” estimating a 25 percent selloff and a bear market lasting at least a year. (Institutional investors, according to an RBC survey, view the Massachusetts Democrat as the candidate most threatening to the stock market, beating out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 51 percent to 38 percent.)

The network just aired a piece suggesting married couples rich enough to face Warren’s wealth tax, which proposes a 2 percent levy on a household's assets greater than $50 million, could avoid it by getting divorced. Richer couples stand to save even more by splitting, since the tax would apply an extra percent to assets over $1 billion. “If a couple worth $2 billion divorces, they would save $10 million a year in taxes,” CNBC’s Robert Frank explained.

Couples could continue living together, the piece suggested, and just legally end their marriages for the tax savings. No matter that Warren’s proposal, if she is nominated then elected, still faces exceedingly long odds in what is expected to be a closely divided Senate.

“The markets probably won't really focus on the campaigns until the candidates have been set next year at the parties' conventions, says Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management,” Randall Forsyth writes in Barron’s. “Even so, Wall Street has taken notice of Warren's recent surge in the polls past Sanders, to second place behind [Biden].”

Indeed, Warren’s growing traction in the Democratic race is making a possible presidency more vivid for financiers she wants to subject to higher taxes and tougher regulation.

The latest Des Moines Register poll showed the senator leading in Iowa for the first time, edging ahead of Biden, 22 percent to 20 percent, though still within the survey’s 4 percent margin of error. And a new national Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll finds Biden and Warren separating from the rest of the field. Biden is backed by 31 percent, Warren pulled in 25 percent, and Sanders, at 14 percent, was the only other candidates with more than single-digit support.

The “ultimate irony,” Valliere writes, is that Trump “is going after the wrong opponent. His scorched earth assault on Biden comes as the former vice president is slipping into second place in the fight to win the nomination. Warren is the candidate Trump needs to worry about; simply calling her ‘Pocahontas’ will not be sufficient to stop her momentum.”

Warren's rise hasn't yet weighed on stock prices. But the rising level of alarm among investors suggests they may be clearer-eyed about Trump’s challengers than the president himself.

MARKET MOVERS

— Wall Street quant finds rising impeachment risk. The possibility of impeachment no longer drives market performance the way it did, say, in the opening months of Trump’s presidency, when the prospect of his ouster clouded the outlook for his corporate tax cut. But GeoQuant CEO Mark Rosenberg, whose firm uses artificial intelligence-powered indexes to chart different kinds of political risks, says Trump now faces the highest risk of impeachment yet. His ""Mueller Risk Index,"" which measures institutional support for the president, shows the threat to Trump spiking early next month:

“I am a bit surprised that these events pushed us to an all time peak--higher than late June 2017, when Mueller expanded the probe to include obstruction and was reportedly ordered to be fired by Trump,” Rosenberg emails. But he also notes his index shows the risk trailing off sharply after early next month, “suggesting that a successful impeachment remains quite unlikely.”

The Post's Karla Adam and William Booth: ""Britain’s highest court dealt a major blow on Tuesday to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, ruling that his controversial decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful, in a landmark judgment that will have immediate implications for Britain’s departure from the European Union. In one of the most high-profile cases to come before Britain’s Supreme Court, the 11 judges ruled unanimously that Johnson had not acted lawfully in shuttering Parliament...

""The decision was a brutal one for the embattled prime minister, asserting that his move to suspend the Parliament was political maneuver, and suggesting that he might have misled the queen... Johnson, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session, said he will not resign.""

— NY Fed: Central bank did the right thing last week. CNBC's Jeff Cox: ""New York Fed President John Williams said Monday that the central bank acted quickly during last week’s jolt to overnight lending markets and that the issue appears resolved for now. However, he cautioned that short-term lending markets face another crisis, though a few years in the distance, if banks don’t prepare themselves for when the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, is phased out. LIBOR is used as an international benchmark for overnight lending.

""Williams also said that there’s potential for further disruptions at the end of the quarter Sept. 30 and that the Fed is continuing to monitor the need for more reserves in the system.""

— Japan trade deal stalls: “The trade agreement [Trump] told Congress he had reached with Japan last week is now hung up amid Japanese concerns that Trump will still move to penalize their auto shipments to the United States, according to two people familiar with the negotiations,” my colleague David J. Lynch reports.

“Japanese officials have insisted they should be able to back out of the deal if Trump imposes these tariffs, something he has threatened to do for more than a year. This concern has emerged as the principal substantive issue before a formal pact can be signed, said the people, who weren’t authorized to discuss the private deliberations. Trump had wanted to ink the deal during the U.N. General Assembly session in New York, but that now appears unlikely.”

What might happen this week: “The finishing touches now are unlikely to be completed in time for Wednesday’s scheduled meeting between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But the leaders may sign a nonbinding statement, according to Japanese news reports.”

— China buys more soybeans after trade talks: “Chinese importers bought about 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans,” Reuters’s Karl Plume reports, a development that occurs “following deputy-level trade talks in Washington last week that were overshadowed by the abrupt cancellation of a U.S. farm state visit by Chinese agriculture officials.”

“The deals for about 600,000 tons, slated for shipment from Pacific Northwest export terminals from October to December, were similar in size to a wave of buying earlier this month, two traders with direct knowledge of the deals said.”

“General counsel Ravinder Passi brought up the matter with Nissan directors by handing them a letter when they gathered Sept. 9 to review the investigation’s results, say people who attended the meeting in Yokohama, Japan … The objections by Mr. Passi and others lay bare the continuing turmoil at the car maker over corporate governance nearly a year after Mr. Ghosn’s arrest and following the resignation this month of Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa.”

“Neumann has not yet agreed to step aside as CEO of WeWork parent We Company, and there is no certainty he will do so, the sources said. However, a board challenge planned by investors, including SoftBank Group Corp and Benchmark Capital, has been put on hold until these discussions produce an outcome, the sources added.”

The list of Democrats calling for Trump’s impeachment has been bolstered in recent days by revelations that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in a phone call that took place shortly after Trump had temporarily suspended military aid to the country.

Democrats have accused Trump of trying to pressure a foreign power to hurt Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential contender. Trump has acknowledged he held back the aid, but denies doing anything improper. On Tuesday, he said he was concerned the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries. He has previously said he was worried about corruption in Ukraine.

In surveys of registered voters since the start of August, Trump has trailed Biden by 14 percentage points in a Fox News poll, by 15 points in a Washington Post-ABC poll, by 12 points in an Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP poll and by 16 points in a Quinnipiac University poll.

After President Trump’s Ukraine scandal drove a new wave of Democrats toward impeachment, on Tuesday afternoon House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally announced that the House will launch a formal impeachment inquiry. It’s obviously a huge step, but there’s still much confusion about what exactly presidential impeachment means, how the process works, and what consequences Trump is likely to face. Since it’s only happened twice in U.S. history (to Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, with Richard Nixon avoiding a near-certain impeachment by resigning), it’s not the sort of thing you get a lot of detail on in high-school American history classes. Here’s what you need to know.

What Is Impeachment?

Impeachment is to official misconduct what an indictment is to crime: a statement of charges leading to a trial. The procedure for congressional impeachment of Executive branch officials (including but not limited to the president) was spelled out in some detail in the U.S. Constitution, as the official House of Representatives history observes:

Impeachment comes from British constitutional history. The process evolved from the 14th century as a way for parliament to hold the king’s ministers accountable for their public actions. Impeachment, as Alexander Hamilton of New York explained in Federalist 65, varies from civil or criminal courts in that it strictly involves the “misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust.” Individual state constitutions had provided for impeachment for “maladministration” or “corruption” before the U.S. Constitution was written. And the founders, fearing the potential for abuse of executive power, considered impeachment so important that they made it part of the Constitution even before they defined the contours of the presidency.

Impeachment is not, to be clear, the removal of corrupt presidents or other officials, but simply the adoption of charges by the House, triggering a trial in the Senate. So Johnson and Clinton were impeached, as the House passed articles of impeachment against them; though they were subsequently acquitted by the Senate, the term still applies. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to consummate an impeachment with removal from office, but the document is otherwise silent about procedures.

What Are Grounds for Impeaching a President?

Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution specifically mentions “treason” and “bribery” as grounds for impeachment, but it also stipulates that “other High Crimes and Misdemeanors” are sufficient. It’s important to understand that when the Constitution was adopted, the term “misdemeanors” had not assumed its later meaning as a type of criminal offense. According to the most common interpretation of this language, impeachment does not require the allegation of a crime, but simply some grave act or pattern of misconduct deemed by Congress as necessitating this radical remedy.

Under House rules and long-standing practice, the House lays out the grounds for impeachment, then holds a simple majority vote. If the articles of impeachment are approved, they’re then presented to the Senate for further action.

In 1868, the House approved 11 articles of impeachment against President Johnson, mostly revolving around his defiance of the (quite possibly unconstitutional) Tenure of Office Act, which restricted the president’s power to dismiss Cabinet members (the underlying “offense” was clearly Johnson’s efforts to obstruct congressional Reconstruction of the former Confederate States).

In 1998, the House approved just two articles of impeachment against Clinton: one alleged that he committed perjury in grand jury testimony when questioned about his sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky, and the second alleged obstruction of justice to hide evidence in that case. It was a highly legalistic argument, which helped buttress the false public impression that without “crimes” there can be no impeachment.

How Does Impeachment Begin?

This has been perhaps the most confusing aspect of the current debate over impeaching Trump. In past presidential impeachments, the House has formally voted to authorize the Judiciary Committee to initiate impeachment proceedings. But this step has been skipped on occasion in the impeachment of judges, and it’s entirely the product of custom and internal House rules (themselves interpreted and controlled by the House majority at a given time).

After the Mueller Report was released and the special counsel himself had finally testified before Congress, House Democrats were deeply divided on whether to “initiate” impeachment proceedings, with Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler voicing reluctance to go in that direction. Then, in what was either a clever or devious maneuver, depending on your point of view, Nadler let it be known in early August that his committee was already engaged in an impeachment “inquiry,” as CNN explained at the time:

The House Judiciary Committee is now engaged in a full-blown investigation and legal fight with the goal of deciding whether to recommend articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump by the end of the year, according to Democratic officials involved in the effort …

As additional House Democrats continue to call for the House Judiciary Committee to launch an impeachment inquiry — which more than half the caucus now supports — Democratic sources say the issue is essentially moot since what the panel is doing is basically that: investigating whether Trump should be impeached.

As I noted at the time, “According to this interpretation of the situation, there’s no need to ‘launch’ anything, or to put House Democrats on the spot with some vote to begin ‘proceedings’ that are already underway.” House Republicans might (and did) complain that a vital step had been left out, but there wasn’t much they could do about it.

But what had looked like a successful effort to postpone any House vote until actual articles of impeachment were considered unraveled under the pressure of Trump’s scofflaw behavior – specifically, the Ukraine scandal and rising House Democratic sentiment favoring a more aggressive posture. While Pelosi’s announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry implicitly endorses Nadler’s claim that ongoing House investigations are an impeachment probe, the House could return to its old procedures and formally authorize such proceedings.

There’s been further confusion about the scope of the impeachment inquiry. During her September 26 press conference (the first she held after announcing the inquiry), Pelosi suggested a phased operation, as I explained:

… Speaker Nancy Pelosi made it clearer than before that the impeachment inquiry she announced yesterday would — for now, at least — focus exclusively on the president’s dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Indeed, she indicated that the House Intelligence Committee would have the primary responsibility for uncovering the facts that might or might not justify actual articles of impeachment (she was adamant that no decision had been made on the ultimate outcome of the “inquiry”).

So for the time being, Jerrold Nadler’s Judiciary Committee (normally the focal point of impeachment proceedings) will be on hold, except for its ongoing investigations of the president and his administration.

That could change later, if House Democrats do decide to pursue articles of impeachment.

Pelosi did hold open the possibility that previous examples of the president’s “lawlessness” could be the subject of impeachment articles if the House went in that direction, as many of those who supported impeachment before the Ukraine scandal broke into public view are insisting upon. But she seemed determined to convey a belief that the public would see Trump’s behavior in the Ukraine incident as reflecting a “different level of lawlessness,” just as she did in “crossing the Rubicon” from opposition to impeachment proceedings to support for them.

There are indications that Pelosi has asked other committees that have been investigating Trump or his administration to put together materials supporting articles of impeachment that could be considered by the Judiciary Committee once the Ukraine investigation is complete.

How Long Do Impeachment Hearings Last?

Some Democrats resisting impeachment fear that it’s too late, or too deeply into the 2020 presidential election cycle, to begin impeachment hearings. Some point to the terrible performance of House Republicans in the 1998 midterms, which were overshadowed by impeachment talk (Clinton’s impeachment was opposed by a majority of Americans, much as polls suggest the public opposes the impeachment of Trump today).

Another consequence of the hazy rules governing the steps leading up to impeachment is that there’s no clear expectation about the duration or depth of impeachment hearings. As Vox’s Andrew Prokop has pointed out, the two most recent precedents point in very different directions:

The Nixon inquiry was an intensive, lengthy investigative effort that proceeded alongside the special prosecutor’s continuing grand jury investigation into the Watergate break-in and cover-up and a Senate select committee inquiry into the matter. The House Judiciary Committee opened it in October 1973 (after the Saturday Night Massacre), the House voted to back it in February 1974, and it lasted until July 1974. Major new revelations about the scandal kept breaking throughout that period, and eventually, the committee got to review secret information from the grand jury probe.

The Clinton inquiry, meanwhile, was essentially just a decision about whether to impeach the president based on the findings of independent counsel Ken Starr’s report (which alleged Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice to try to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky). That impeachment inquiry was officially opened in the Judiciary Committee after votes by the committee and then the whole House in October 1998. The committee held a few weeks of hearings and heard witness testimony (including from Starr), but it wasn’t really a new investigation, and it was over by mid-December.

It appears House Democrats are trying to balance the need for relatively simple and expeditious proceedings with concerns that they might appear to be “rushing to judgment.” Here’s the current thinking about the pace:

NEW w/ @rachaelmbade -- Dems eye impeachment sprint over coming weeks...

-Intel Cmte takes lead on Ukraine as other cmtes wrap probes

-Few, if any hearings

-No set timeline, but some Dems eyeing floor vote around T'givinghttps://t.co/u95zqb9K1k — Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) September 26, 2019

On the other hand, you could see the pace dictated by public opinion, with Pelosi in particular looking for evidence that the hearings were softening independent and even Republican opposition to impeachment.

How Does the House Vote on Impeachment Itself?

Under all precedents, the Judiciary Committee will debate and vote upon each proposed article of impeachment, and if any are approved (and of course there would be no committee vote unless success was assured), they are reported to the full House for debate and a conclusive vote for impeachment.

Typically, the party pushing impeachment will favor a tight set of resolutions that revolve around a clear pattern of malfeasance, and that might even attract members of the president’s party (or at least some of his supporters).

In July of 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three of five proposed articles impeaching Nixon. The first to draw a vote, alleging presidential obstruction of justice, attracted six of the committee’s 17 Republicans. Though two other articles were subsequently reported, one was sufficient for impeachment and a Senate trial, so the committee vote led directly to Nixon’s resignation before the House could formally impeach him.

In Clinton’s case, the Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment, with committee Democrats voting en bloc against all of them. Enough Republicans defected on the House floor to defeat two of these articles, and only five Democrats voted for the crucial article impeaching Clinton for lying under oath to a federal grand jury about his relationship to Lewinsky.

If a President Is Impeached, Does the Senate Have to Hold a Trial?

Most experts believe the provisions made for an impeachment trial in both the Constitution and in Senate rules mean some sort of proceedings are obligatory. But then we are talking about Mitch McConnell being in charge, and even if you think he is required to hold a trial, who is going to enforce that requirement? The courts are likely to stay away from a conflict as a “political question.”

But McConnell has publicly talked about holding impeachment trials as though it’s not a real question, most recently describing it as obligatory:

McConnell, to CNBC, on the Senate's obligation if the House impeaches Trump:



""I would have no choice but to take it up."" — Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) September 30, 2019

You’d also have to figure Republicans will want some deliberations, however superficial, so they can claim Trump has been exonerated.

There are not, however, constitutional or Senate provisions requiring a trial of any particular length or depth. And it could go pretty fast, as I noted earlier this year:

Chief Justice John Roberts would preside over any impeachment trial, but Mitch McConnell would determine the schedule and the Senate itself could by a simple majority vote (almost certainly a party-line vote) control evidence and witnesses. In the unlikely event there are four Senate Republicans (the minimum requisite number to deny their party a majority) willing to buck McConnell on any particular controversy involving impeachment, the odds are very high such dissenters will want a quick trial to limit partisan blowback. All in all, it’s clear that if the House impeaches Trump, you can expect a Senate acquittal with as much speed as any kangaroo court could devise.

If there is anything like a real trial, it is assumed the House’s representatives (or “managers”) will be given an opportunity to present and explain the articles of impeachment on which the trial will be based, much like prosecutors in criminal cases (though in the Clinton case, the Senate chose not to let the managers call live witnesses). The president typically can choose representatives to present his case (Clinton’s defense was led by attorney Charles Ruff, whose team included former Arkansas senator Dale Bumpers). According to precedent, senators act like jurors, making no public statements on the proceeding until after their votes are cast (in the Clinton case, senators spoke before the vote in a closed-door session, with their remarks published in the Congressional Record after the vote).

The Johnson impeachment trial in 1868 lasted from March 5 until May 16, when the Senate’s first crucial “test vote” on a catch-all article of impeachment failed by one vote. Ten days later the Senate voted predictably to acquit on two other articles, and subsequently voted for general acquittal and adjournment.

Clinton’s impeachment trial was more hurried: It began on January 7, 1999, when presiding officer Chief Justice William Rehnquist was sworn in, and ended on February 12, with Clinton’s easy acquittal on both articles (45 senators, all Republicans, voted for his guilt on the perjury article, with ten Republicans defecting; and 50 senators vote for the obstruction article, with five Republicans defecting).

What Are the Odds the Senate Would Vote to Convict Trump and Remove Him From Office?

As indicated above, the odds of Trump being removed via impeachment range from “slim” to “none.” It would take only 34 of 54 Senate Republicans to acquit Trump, and the idea that 20 senators from a party dominated by this president like a Bronze Age warlord would defy the MAGA base and try to defenestrate him on the brink of an epochal presidential election is, in a word, laughable. And that’s true no matter what Nadler’s committee uncovers, or what journalists dig up, or what the president himself admits in one of his moments when his belief in his own invincibility overcomes all good judgment (“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn’t lose any voters,” he famously boasted). Perhaps there is a theoretical set of events that could rapidly erode Trump’s partisan invincibility the way Watergate gradually eroded Nixon’s, but it’s hard to imagine and impossible to expect.

So How Is This All Likely to End?

Assuming Trump is impeached and then acquitted, this saga will conclude with the 2020 presidential election, and with Trump’s ejection from office or his triumphal reelection. It’s possible, of course, that whether or not the current impeachment drive goes anywhere, a second-term Trump could get himself impeached (indeed, some Democratic opponents of impeaching Trump now think this option should be saved for later, when his conduct would undoubtedly become far worse). But most likely his impeachment, or even impeachment hearings, will reinforce the sense that the 2020 election is a high-stakes referendum on the sprawling corruption, norm-breaking, and racist and sexist attitudes of the 45th president.

It’s the possible impact of impeachment on Trump’s reelection that has caused so many arguments among Democrats (mostly in Washington, since rank-and-file Democrats have been trending pro-impeachment for some time). Best we can tell from polls, the public is not making any sort of fine distinctions between “initiating impeachment proceedings” or impeaching Trump or removing him from office. Once Democrats head decisively down that road they may as well follow it until its logical end. Some sincerely believe impeachment will hurt Trump in 2020 by focusing public attention on his misconduct and conveying a clear sense of Democratic purpose in holding him and his corrupt hirelings accountable (or conversely, that failing to impeach Trump will depress Democratic “base” enthusiasm). Others (most clearly presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren) argue that it’s a constitutional or moral duty even if it helps produce the horror of a second Trump term.

Any way you look at it, the implications of what House Democrats now decide to do could be momentous yet hard to adjudge until the ultimate deal goes down.

DECORAH, Iowa — The crowd that came to see Bernie Sanders was too big for Luther College's gym. It spilled over into a yard, where the senator delivered a short version of his stump speech — “the fate of the planet is at stake, democracy is at stake” — before he walked into a room full of “Bernie Beats Trump” signs.

But not everyone who showed up was sold on that message.

“I'm not necessarily a Bernie fan,” said Justin Knautz, 20, who said he was leaning toward South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigeg. “Even if he could beat Trump, which I'm not sure about, our country's so divided already.”

“I'm super confident that he'd win,” Avery Pazour, 20, said of Sanders. “Young people are tired of the system the way that it is.”

“I'm exactly the opposite,” said Marin Gabor, 21. “I like Pete Buttigieg's public-health option. I guess that's a weird thing for a young person to say?""

Five months after Sanders began arguing that he was the most electable Democratic candidate, a pitch he made with a tour of Rust Belt states, he has made little progress with voters terrified of a second Trump term. National and state polling has found Sanders persistently behind former vice president Joe Biden when voters are asked who has the best chance of defeating the president. In the past month, polling has found Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) roughly tied with Sanders on “electability.”

The “Bernie beats Trump” tour was the latest attempt to push back. That meant showing what a general election would look like, with the candidate leading raw, emotional town hall meetings where voters explained how the economic system failed them. It meant emphasizing that polling had shown him ahead of Trump in 2016 — an argument he briefly made to “superdelegates.” It meant reminding people that he had won the primaries in Wisconsin and Michigan, where some Democrats slept on the 2016 general election.

In Iowa, Sanders occasionally referred to the national and state polls that have shown him ahead of Trump, but in an interview, he waved off the polling that had shown Democratic voters still nervous about how a democratic socialist could take the presidency.

“I'm not much into all these speculations and all these polls,” Sanders said. “One day a poll has me doing great, the next day a poll has me doing terrible. It has a lot to do with who you're polling and what questions you're asking. But at the end of the day, I think we're going to win, because we have an extraordinary grass-roots movement.”

Apart from some turnover in its early state staff, the Sanders campaign has shown some broad support. It celebrated its 1 millionth individual donor last week; shortly after that, it drew an estimated 4,000 voters to a rally in Norman, Okla. (A 2016 rally in Tulsa, three times the size of Norman, had attracted a crowd of 11,000.)

But it has struggled to convince early-state voters that Sanders could win a general election, and the senator's support in early states has slipped since the start of his campaign. In interviews around the state, some at the senator from Vermont's rallies, voters sometimes praised Sanders or explained why they used to support him before laying out the reasons that they were supporting someone else.

“I love him. We caucused for him in 2016,” said Scott German, 50, who spent Monday evening at a rally for Buttigieg in Dubuque. “If he could win and put forward everything he's talking about, it'd be utopia. But I don't think America's ready for it. We need somebody more realistic.”

Sanders's campaign is combating the skepticism with a busy schedule and with sharp contrasts, some of them brighter than others. When Sanders announced his 1 millionth donor, campaign manager Faiz Shakir described him as “the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grass-roots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump” — a knock at Warren, who has said her no-fundraisers pledge applies to only the primary and who is headlining some fundraisers for the DNC.

Speech by speech, Sanders has structured an electability pitch around his brand — that of an Old Testament prophet who has been saying the same things about health care and economic fairness for 30 years. At four rallies on Monday, he emphasized that taxes would go up to pay for Medicare-for-all, encouraging the crowd to think about how the media would frame that.

“Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes! How terrible is this guy?” Sanders said sarcastically in Decorah, waving his arms and imitating a negative ad. The upshot: He was ready to handle the criticism, some candidates were not, and therefore, he could win.

That theory is getting a real-time test in Iowa, one that has not gone well for Sanders. His campaign believes that the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a front group for insurance companies, has done damage to his support among Democrats by running digital and TV ads attacking Medicare-for-all. (Sanders has not yet purchased TV time in early states.) The senator's favorable numbers have decreased since the spring, robbing supporters of something that was true for years: that he was the most popular politician in America.

“There's a lot of lies going on about this,” Sanders said in Dubuque. “There's the health-care industry that's already advertising in here in Iowa. Every time you see that ad, know who paid for that ad! It was paid for by the drug companies and the insurance companies who made a hundred billion in profits last year. They love the current system! They're scared to death that we have the momentum to move to Medicare-for-all.”

The insurance industry ads make good foils, but Sanders is just as happy to criticize Biden. After learning that a pollster at Anzalone Liszt Grove Research had been testing messages against Medicare-for-all — John Anzalone is an adviser to Biden — Sanders emphasized that he was collecting story after story of medical debt, denied coverage and personal pain. Even after his events ended, he was being buttonholed by people with insurance horror stories. At every event, Sanders sees a story that is not being told in the corporate media. As the nominee, with that media bound to cover him, he could cut through the fog, he believes.

“If Joe Biden or anybody else wants to use the Republican Party and the health-care industry talking points, I guess they can. But we're going to win this fight because we're going to refute that disingenuous attack,” Sanders said. “You know, I think when I raised the issue during the last debate, that we spend twice as much, Biden's response was, 'This is America.' Well, I don't know that Americans have to be chumps and to give the health-care industry $100 billion a year.”

Polling has found Democrats to be nervous about that argument, even if they agree with Sanders on the merits. In the Des Moines Register's weekend poll, a quarter of Democrats said they supported the concept of Medicare-for-all but were worried it was a general election loser — a threat to the entire Sanders premise.

At a Democratic meeting in Story County on Sunday, Linda Trudeau, 72, said that had never been convinced that Sanders could win. Warren had piqued her interest, she said, because she seemed liberal, but less stubborn.

“She's got to give up Medicare-for-all or she won't get elected,” said Trudeau. “She's not quite nailed down on that, unlike Bernie. That's a good thing.”

ON THE TRAIL

Pete Buttigieg speaks at a campaign event in Clinton, Iowa, on Tuesday. (Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters)

DUBUQUE, Iowa — First, there are the introductions from local Democrats. Then there’s the theme song — “High Hopes” by Panic! at the Disco, with a brass hook that tests the integrity of speakers and eardrums. Then the bus — a bus previously hired by everyone from Barack Obama to the producers of “Madam Secretary” — rolls into view. Only then does Pete Buttigieg race onto stage.

“Thanks for making me feel right at home!” Buttigieg told the crowd, 800 voters at an amphitheater on the banks of the Mississippi River. “You know, Dubuque has a great reputation among mayors — an example of a city leading the way, when Washington can’t get its act together.”

Buttigieg, one of the few Democrats whose favorability has increased over the primary campaign, is busy reintroducing himself as the candidate who can talk about anything — no gaffes, no dodges. On the bus, Buttigieg took questions on everything from college football (“problematic”) to how many white button-down shirts he owned (“a baker’s dozen”) to the violent abolitionist John Brown (“kind of a brutal guy”). When his Dubuque speech was over, Buttigieg worked the rope line for a half-hour, then walked over to the few reporters not on the bus to take more questions.

It wasn't an entirely new strategy. Buttigieg's early jump in the polls came after he did interview after interview, saying yes to TV shows and small outlets that were used to getting turned down. Most voters would not hear everything he said, but they could see that he was taking any questions.

The bus tour, and the entire media strategy, was also designed to show a contrast. The voters seen as most gettable for Buttigieg are moderates who have been disappointed by Joe Biden; the former vice president holds frequent media availabilities but has made a series of confusing statements, all of them amplified by social media.

Buttigieg's accessibility also contrasts with the candidates who've commanded the most attention so far, and for different reasons. Elizabeth Warren's short press gaggles are designed to make minimal news, and in the past week, she swerved back to a stock answer when asked whether her Medicare plans would raise “middle-class taxes” — something Buttigieg pounced on.

“Sen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question,” Buttigieg had told CNN before the start of the tour. “And we've seen that repeatedly.”

Buttigieg's approach also clashed with Kamala Harris, whose uneasy answers to some policy questions sapped her momentum, and with Bernie Sanders, who often urges reporters to steer back to his preferred topic instead of badgering him about the horse race or the latest Trump news. With that group of competitors, and with a support base that gushes about his ability to communicate, Buttigieg's advantage was clear: He could go on the record about anything. The comparison with other candidates would become obvious.

“I will explain how we will pay for every promise that I make,” Buttigieg said in Dubuque. “It's why I'm a little careful about the promises I do make.”

On the stump, Buttigieg did not mention rival candidates by name. “I think I've named my disagreements with their plans at various times,” he explained afterward. Other candidates, such as Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, have also described their plans as realistic, or truth-telling — candidates who promise more than could probably pass, or plans that aren't fully paid for, get described as less straightforward. Asked whether he would rule out any middle-class tax increases, Buttigieg emphasized that nothing he was for had required them.

“Everything that we've rolled out to date can be achieved without a middle-class tax increase, and we're going to make sure that it's clear how the revenue side will work,” he said. “It does mean tax increases for the top 2 percent. It will mean a wealth tax or something like it. It can certainly mean closing corporate tax loopholes.”

How far would the transparency go? Several campaigns lagging behind Buttigieg have criticized him for holding so many fundraisers. Unlike Biden, who has faced the same criticism, Buttigieg has not let the media in to cover those fundraisers.

“We're open to thinking about it,” he said. “I think right now we're focused on what we can achieve on the bus tour, because it's just a different conversation than any other format that we have. But the team will always evaluate strategy and other ideas.”

POLL WATCH

New Hampshire Democratic primary (Monmouth, 401 likely Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 27% ( 19)

Joe Biden — 25% (-9)

Bernie Sanders — 12% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg — 10% ( 1)

Kamala Harris — 3% (-3)

Cory Booker — 2% (-)

Tulsi Gabbard — 2% ( 2)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% (-)

Tom Steyer — 2% ( 2)

Andrew Yang — 2% ( 1)

Beto O’Rourke — 1% (-1)

Marianne Williamson — 1% ( 1)

Polling in the first primary state has found (with different methodology) everything from a sizable lead for Bernie Sanders to resilient support for Joe Biden. This is the first major poll to find Elizabeth Warren positioned in the lead, albeit within the margin of error; more important is her favorable rating, which has risen since May from a net 39 points to a net 55 points, higher than any other candidate. Warren's strength extends even to voters who disagree with her on health care; she wins 40 percent of Democrats who, like she, support single-payer, but wins 25 percent among Democrats who support a ""public option"" instead. Warren's positioning might be helping her; she has endorsed a bevy of liberal health-care bills and is not as strongly associated as Sanders with Medicare-for-all.

Nevada Democratic caucus (Suffolk, 500 likely voters)

Joe Biden — 23%

Elizabeth Warren — 19%

Bernie Sanders — 14%

Kamala Harris — 4%

Pete Buttigieg — 3%

Cory Booker — 3%

Tom Steyer — 3%

Andrew Yang — 3%

Tulsi Gabbard — 1%

Michael Bennet — 1%

Beto O’Rourke — 1%

Julián Castro — 1%

The least-visited early state — even Democrats sometimes forget that it caucuses before South Carolina votes — has no obvious favorite. A tiny plurality of voters said that Elizabeth Warren did worse than they expected in the September debate; a tiny plurality said that Joe Biden did worse than they expected.

DEBATE SEASON

The fifth DNC debates, which will be held sometime in November, will introduce new, strict thresholds for entry in the latest effort to limit the party's biggest nights to candidates with widespread support. The short version: Candidates will need 165,000 individual donations (up from 130,000) to get space onstage, and polling at 2 percent won't cut it anymore.

In the new rules, candidates can reach the polling threshold in two ways: by hitting 3 percent in four polls (or more) recognized by the DNC or by hitting 5 percent in two (or more) polls taken in the first four primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The count started Sept. 13; it'll stop seven days before the date of the fifth debate, which has not yet been announced.

The DNC is transparent about which polls it counts. They are: the Associated Press; ABC News-Washington Post; CBS News-YouGov; CNN; Des Moines Register; Fox News; Monmouth University; NPR; NBC News-Wall Street Journal; NBC News-Marist; New York Times; Quinnipiac University; University of New Hampshire; USA Today-Suffolk University; and Winthrop University, which polls in South Carolina.

At the moment, using these standards, just five candidates have qualified for the November debate: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Just four other candidates have claimed to reach that new donor threshold: Tom Steyer, Tulsi Gabbard, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang.

2020

Joe Biden. He gave a prepared statement in Wilmington, Del., addressing the Ukraine saga more fully by saying no allegation about his son Hunter had merit and that the president was setting himself on a course to impeachment: “a tragedy of his own making.”

Tulsi Gabbard. She qualified for the fourth Democratic debate, after notching her fourth poll at 2 percent support — the Monmouth poll from New Hampshire. That significantly ups the chances of CNN, the debate's TV host, splitting the debate into two nights, each with six candidates.

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a new version of a “wealth tax,” a concept that he had introduced five years ago but that Elizabeth Warren had formulated for this presidential campaign. Unlike Warren's 2 percent tax (which has been strong when polled), Sanders's would tackle wealth in tiers: a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million, a 4 percent tax on net worth between $500 million and $1 billion, a 5 percent tax on net worth between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, a 6 percent tax on net worth between $2.5 billion $5 billion, a 7 percent tax on net worth between $5 billion and $10 billion, and an 8 percent tax on net worth above $10 billion.

Elizabeth Warren. She'll return to New Hampshire on Wednesday and Friday, her first visits to the state since shifts in polling found her in contention to win the primary. In a Q&A with the Council on Foreign Relations, she laid out her policies on issues not much discussed at campaign events, such as the fate of Venezuela's embattled president.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Pick your metaphor — the dam is breaking, or maybe the floodgates, or maybe the Rubicon is being crossed — but House Democrats have begun moving faster toward some form of impeachment, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. The president's apparent effort to obtain damaging information on Joe Biden's son in a call with Ukraine's president has pushed dozens of “front-line” Democrats into the fray; in the past 48 hours, more Democrats who represent districts won by President Trump have endorsed impeachment than had endorsed it in the past nine months.

Republicans claim to be overjoyed. “They’re obsessed with impeaching President Trump and they don’t care if they have to throw away the House Majority to do it,” wrote Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the House GOP's super PAC, after a group of Trump-seat Democrats came out for impeachment proceedings.

Thirty-one House Democrats represent districts won by the president in 2016, but they're not all created equal.

Blue-trending districts. Ten House Democrats won 2018 races in areas where Donald Trump ran behind Mitt Romney, from the Detroit suburbs won by Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan to the Chicago exurbs won by Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. And some of these districts voted for the statewide Democratic tickets last year, suggesting that the Trump brand has continued to hurt local Republicans.

Trump-trending districts. Twenty-one Democrats represent districts that either edged a toward the president in 2016, some by a little (Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia's district went from a 2.3-point Mitt Romney win to 3.4-point Trump win), some by a lot (Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota's massive district backed Mitt Romney by 9.8 points, then Trump by 30.8 points). Twelve of them come from places that flipped from backing Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Trump four years later.

Democrats with/without real opponents. The filing deadline for 2020 races is months away; only Illinois and Texas require House candidates to file by the end of this year. But not every Democrat who flipped a House seat last year is facing a real challenge yet. Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania is facing a first-time challenger who has raised less than $20,000; Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan hasn't drawn a Republican opponent. On the other side of the equation are Democrats such as Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, whose chief opponent, Wesley Hunt, raised more than $500,000 in just a few months as a candidate; after Fletcher joined the impeachment call, Hunt accused her of endorsing a ""blatantly partisan impeachment investigation.”

A confused reader passed along a tweet with a clip of these remarks. What was Biden talking about?

AD

After all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.

AD

Biden’s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:

He meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.

He meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck. (The line he used in the last primary debate was: “It’s going to cost you in your pay — there will be a deductible in your paycheck”).

He meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not “5 percent and 4 percent.”

We understand politicians can misspeak — though Biden seems to do it more often than most — so we won’t be awarding Pinocchios. But the point he was trying to make gets to the heart of the debate about the cost of a single-payer health plan. So it’s worth exploring this issue and explaining it to readers, especially because more than 100,000 people watched the video embedded in the tweet.

AD

The Facts

Sanders, as Biden noted, has said his plan will raise taxes, but argues that the cost of health care will be lower overall. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), rising fast in the polls, has embraced Sanders’s plan but studiously avoids answering any questions about a possible tax increase. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) used to support the Sanders plan but then crafted her own version, in part because of what she called “a middle-class tax hike” embedded in the plan. Her plan would phase in much more slowly and still retain a role for private insurance.

AD

Biden has rejected a single-payer approach and advocated building on the Affordable Care Act, the law expanding health-care access passed during the Obama administration.

AD

Actually, no one really knows what would happen. You have to take any of the numbers offered by advocates and detractors with a huge grain of salt. As we have documented before, the cost of any health-care proposal will be affected by a variety of factors, including provider payments, health-care benefits, cost-sharing and administrative savings from a consolidated system. Any complex bill overhauling health care faces daunting prospects in a closely divided Congress.

But for the sake of argument, let’s look at the numbers Biden and Sanders are using.

Sanders has offered a menu of possible options to finance the cost of Medicare-for-all. One option would require a 7.5 percent payroll tax that employers would pay to help fund the program. Another would be a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households. (That’s what Harris labeled a middle-class tax hike.)

AD

AD

But Sanders argues that those taxes would be cheaper than the current system.

Sanders offers as an example a prototypical family of four earning $50,000. He says the employer is currently paying $12,865 a year in health-care premiums for this family, while the family pays $5,277 in premiums. Virtually every economist will tell you that payroll taxes or health-insurance premiums paid by an employer largely comes out of the pay earned by the employee.

For instance, both employers and employees pay 6.2 percent to Social Security (on the first $132,900 of wages) and 1.45 percent to Medicare. The employer obviously counts that 7.65 percent ($3,825 for a $50,000 wage) as part of the cost of employing that person, as well as the nearly $13,000 in health insurance premiums. To the employer, the cost of that employee is not $50,000, but almost $67,000. (There are tax deductions for employer-provided health insurance, but we will ignore them as part of this illustration.)

AD

AD

But note that almost $13,000 in insurance premiums is 26 percent of $50,000. Sanders’s 7.5 percent tax would be $3,750, so that suggests more than $9,000 in savings for the employer. Under Medicare-for-all, the total cost of the employee to the employer would be a little over $57,000, a reduction of more than $9,000.

As for the 4 percent income premium paid by the employee, that amounts to $844 a year, once the standard deduction is taken into account, Sanders says. That’s far less than the nearly $5,300 in premiums currently paid by this family.

Biden, by contrast, only focuses on the cost of tax increase (apparently because polling has found that it’s a way to undercut support for Medicare-for-all). In the debate, Biden argued that a three-person family earning $60,000 a year will face more than $5,000 in taxes — the 4 percent premium tax ($1,240 after the standard deduction) and the 7.5 percent tax paid by employers ($4,500), on the widely accepted economic theory that payroll taxes paid by employers are passed onto employees.

AD

AD

Notice that he did not take into account any of the savings that Sanders claims his plan will generate both for the employee and employer. So he’s really only telling half the story, misleadingly ignoring a possible reduction in health-care costs for many Americans.

Sanders also chose an example in which the numbers work in his favor. The savings for the employer fade as an employee’s wages increase.

Sanders also focuses on the cost of a family plan, which has much higher premiums. The Milliman Medical Index, a respected accounting of health-care costs, says the employer contribution in 2019 will be $3,773 per person. (Total health-care costs for a family of four on an employer-provided plan are $28,386, Milliman says.) So a single person making $50,000 in theory would barely represent any savings for that employer — a 7.5 percent payroll tax on $50,000 is $3,750 — and the tax would quickly be higher than current expenses as wages increase.

AD

AD

Similarly, wealthier Americans would end up paying much more in taxes than they currently pay for health-care premiums. (We take no position on whether that’s good or bad, and certainly Sanders and Warren have been forthright in saying the wealthy would largely finance the plan.)

The uncertain complexity was examined in a 2018 University of Massachusetts at Amherst study that predicted the impact of enacting Medicare-for-all in a variety of employer and employee scenarios. The report does not examine all of the same financing options as Sanders, but it calculated that a three-person family with $60,000 income would gain almost $1,600 (2.6 percent) in additional income under Medicare-for-all, while a family with income of $221,000 (top 20 percent of wages earners), would lose $8,520 (3.9 percent) and a family with $401,000 (top 5 percent) would lose $22,340 (5.6 percent). (To create these scenarios, the report relies on data for 2016 mean incomes for various income ranges.)

Meanwhile, the report said most businesses would see a reduction in costs with even an 8.2 percent payroll tax but that firms of more than 500 employees would experience a 5.7 percent increase in health-care costs.

AD

AD

“Vice President Biden’s priority as president will be to make sure every single American has access to affordable, quality health insurance in the quickest, most cost-effective way possible,” Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said. “That’s why his plan is to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option, allowing people to choose between this new option and their private plan, and taking other steps to lower health-care costs. Biden has also made clear that any health-care plan that raises taxes on the middle class is a nonstarter.”

The Bottom Line

Biden emphasizes the higher taxes that Medicare-for-all would impose while ignoring the fact that for many middle-class Americans (if you accept Sanders’s math) the change may result in higher incomes and lower health-care costs. It’s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation, and we will keep an eye on how Biden frames this in the future to see if he merits Pinocchios.

AD

Biden may have bungled his lines at the town hall, but he still has not developed an effective or sophisticated counterargument to Sanders’s prediction of lower overall costs. You can understand why Warren has generally refused to even acknowledge that there are higher taxes embedded in Medicare-for-all. She stays focused instead on an overall reduction in costs, clearly not wanting to engage in a debate on Biden’s playing field.

Photo: Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images

Ben: President Trump’s repeated suggestion to Ukraine’s president that he investigate Joe Biden, and whether he dangled money in exchange for such an investigation, is such egregious and obvious misconduct that some Democrats who had been on the fence about impeachment seem to be coming around; even Nancy Pelosi is gesturing that she might get there eventually. We here at Intelligencer HQ have not exactly been gung ho on impeachment — Jon and I have been opposed, and Eric has been in the middle — compared with the majority of Democrats who are all-in, according to polls. Does this change your thinking?

Jon: I am unsure but starting to move closer to pro-impeachment, though my position is in part an axiomatic response to what Congress thinks — the more Congress supports impeachment, the better an idea it is in my view.

The worst outcome would be an impeachment resolution that fails. Next worst, a resolution that gets 218 votes. At minimum, you need close to all the Democrats, plus Justin Amash, the one Republican who has supported impeachment. When you get close to unanimity among Democrats, that’s when the idea hits a threshold of being a good idea. (That’s my view, not saying that’s the only view — others disagree).

Eric: I’ve been agnostic on impeachment, on the grounds that whether or not it’s a good idea depends almost entirely on whether it helps or hurts Trump’s reelection prospects. And there is some reason to believe it would perversely help Trump on the margins — polls suggest impeachment is unpopular, particularly with the very strange subset of the population that still isn’t sure which team it’s on; Republicans did extremely poorly in that one midterm after impeaching Clinton. On the other hand, forcing Susan Collins to cast a vote directly abetting Trump’s lawlessness could help Dems secure a critical Senate seat. And there are some plausible arguments out there that impeachment would create a media environment that would ultimately undermine Trump. In my view, it seems impossible for anyone to know exactly how all this would play out.

As Trump’s high crimes and misdemeanors grow more numerous and audacious, the moralistic case for erring on the side of “doing your constitutional duty” does get harder for me to dismiss, though.

Jon: I am still annoyed by the moralistic case. To me, it’s 100 percent practical: If you think the result will help Trump hold power, do not do it, full stop. Now, that is a debatable thing, as you say. But the fact that people keep asserting moralistically that we must do it makes me very distrustful of the whole crusade. They’re broadcasting that they don’t care what the outcome is or that they don’t see how morality could override the practical impact. In what world is “We helped Trump win, but we did the right thing” a sensible argument that people would make after the 2020 election?

Eric: Yeah, I guess it’s not the moralism I find compelling so much as … the possibility that the moralists may actually be right that pursuing impeachment would have an inhibiting effect on Trump’s transgressions — if only because it would commandeer his attention, leaving less free time for crimes.

Jon: I agree, that is very possible.

Ben: Both of your points get to the heart of why I’m struggling with this question. Before this latest revelation, I was anti-impeachment because (1) the majority of voters were not in favor of doing it, and it would likely alienate some of them, at least to an extent; (2) Trump will certainly be acquitted and have his triumphant moment; and (3) it is unlikely to make him any more unpopular, in my opinion, despite what pro-impeachment voices think. Those three objections still hold water, I think, but to just sit there while he openly undermines an upcoming election may be a bridge too far for me. I do think voters will understand going to war over this more than they do relitigating obstruction in a Russia investigation they never cared much about. So the practical case is slightly better than it was, and the moral case (sorry, Jon) is getting to be overwhelming. And there’s the fact that I was never fully confident that impeachment would actually hurt a Democrat’s reelection chances — nobody really knows.

Jon: Morals! [Spits on ground] I think the main hurt is the 40 Democratic seat-flippers. The presidential nominee would be fine, I think, but House members could get hurt for voting to impeach, which is why I think the right move is to listen to them (which Pelosi is obviously doing).

Eric: As the ranks of secretly anti-Trump retiring House Republicans multiply, I do wonder if a couple of them can be won over to Team Amash. It would help the Democrats message this.

Ben: Another practical argument is that this would focus attention on Trump’s efforts to undermine the election, which are likely to grow more and more intense. I think there’s a definite upside to that.

Jon: That would matter. I don’t see how impeachment prevents Trump from undermining the election, though.

Eric: Matt Yglesias mentioned this over the weekend, I think, but opposition parties in states ruled by corrupt/proto-authoritarian regimes often mobilize mass protests and civil disobedience to check the incumbents’ power. Not sure whether that would in fact be a means of imposing a cost on Trump’s lawlessness without jeopardizing incumbent Dems (not hard to imagine a case for why it’d do neither of those things). But I think it is worth considering mechanisms for resistance beyond those suggested by our shitty Constitution

Ben: Eric “Smash the State” Levitz.

Eric: Or at least the Trump-owned properties.

Jon: Impeachment is too radical; revolution is the answer. Seriously, though, protesting the Trump properties seems like a no-brainer. Why don’t people do that? Is there no space? (There is in D.C.!) I visited the Trump hotel there with my family last winter. I couldn’t understand why there aren’t crowds out there 24/7 screaming that the people inside are criminals.

Ben: At least give it a bad Yelp review.

Eric: Yeah, I feel like “Make it harder for Trump to profit off the presidency by protesting constantly outside his clearly marked profit centers” seems like a sound strategy.

Soros and Steyer can pay the protesters.

Jon: My friend once mistakenly walked into a place in Brooklyn and was looking at a group of obvious mobsters. One of them said, “You’re in the wrong place.” And he scooted. I felt like the Trump Hotel should be like that. It’s this notorious center of criminal activity. But you can just walk right in there. It’s weird.

Ben: All right, back to impeachment. To what extent do you think elevating this story might backfire for Democrats, or at least for Joe Biden? While there’s no hint of actual illegality in the Bidens’ involvement with Ukraine, it’s true that Joe’s son was being paid $50,000 a month by a sketchy oligarch for services that are unclear. It gives off the appearance of garden-variety influence peddling, which is not generally popular among voters.

Jon: It’s definitely true that every time Trump or his surrogates are asked about it, they respond with a soundbite attacking Biden, and the media carry those soundbites. So certainly it hurts Biden more than any other Democrat.

Eric: Yeah. And given that Warren has staked out a leadership position on impeachment while Biden has not, such a push could hurt him in more ways than one.

Ben: What about the substantive charges there, that Biden’s family shouldn’t have been involved with this stuff in the first place? Did he mess up in that regard?

Jon: Reportedly, Hunter took that job without ever consulting his father and/or Hunter is definitely a screwup, the Don Jr. of the Biden family, a ne’er-do-well who just trades on his dad’s name. The good news is that by all appearances, he is fooling clients into believing he has pull, of which there’s no evidence.

Ben: Do you think it’s inevitable that impeachment is going to happen at this point?

Jon: No, not at all. The clock is ticking, and once the campaign is underway I think it gets harder.

Ben: Of course we also don’t have the full details of what really happened on this phone call, etc.

Jon: Thursday’s hearing will be important.

Eric: Yeah, at this point, it’s not clear that the news cycle won’t digest this Ukraine thing in a week’s time. When and if the news moves on, I imagine the impeachment talk will lose momentum. Remember when the fact that Saudi Arabia openly killed a Washington Post columnist was supposed to somehow change our relationship with its government?

Jon: The whistle-blower report is a hook. That keeps the story going. My guess is they release a transcript, possibly edited, and not the full report to see if it goes away.

Eric: Plausible.

Ben: I want to get you both on the record, right now, on Monday, September 23. Where exactly do you stand on impeachment?

Jon: Still opposed but now impeachment-curious.

Eric: 🤷"

First, no question that has been asked before should be asked again. Moderators have run the Medicare-for-all vs. public option argument into the ground, yet neglected education, debt, Russia, the courts, jobs, Iran, civil rights and a slew of other topics.

Second, moderators should be able to turn candidates’ microphones on and off. No interruptions. No cross talk. No going wildly over time. Period. Let people talk and then enter an orderly queue for responses, comments, etc.

Third, the debates need fewer questions and longer answers, while also not running longer than two hours. (No normal viewer can handle much more than that.) Eliminate open and closing statements and do one topic per 30 minutes, for a total of four subjects. The candidates should be compelled to talk at length on major topics so we can assess what they think, how they reason and what they know. Imagine a debate with four questions only (with needed follow-ups):

AD

AD

What legal or constitutional changes do we need post-Trump to protect our democracy?

How would you increase American productivity?

What would be your policy toward Russia?

What, if anything would you do about the debt?

Longer segments are more likely to force the candidates off soundbites and require them to think more substantively about critical issues. Certainly, in the context of the debt, for example, entitlement programs and taxes could be addressed. In the productivity discussion everything from job training to infrastructure to K-12 education would be fair game.

Fourth, let the candidates ask some follow-up questions of one another. (Each one gets one question for one other candidate.) Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) could ask Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) why a store manager with no college degree should be paying taxes to subsidize wealthy kids’ college education. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could ask Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) how she will get rid of the filibuster when all Republican senators and several Democrats oppose such a move.

The debates have become Kabuki performances that do not assist voters to make informed decisions or candidates to demonstrate the depth of their knowledge and preparedness. They haven’t changed many voters’ minds because they are currently designed to create conflict, reward zingers and reinforce trite narratives. Frankly, as the debates are currently constituted, candidates should not have to spend this much time on these useless or even counterproductive exercises. If the DNC cannot figure out how to improve the debates, they should dump them.

UPDATE: The DNC announced its new criteria: 165,000 donors (including a minimum of 600 donors per state in at least 20 states) plus either 5 percent in two early state polls or 3 percent in four otherwise-approved polls. That should reduce the field. Now the DNC needs to fix the debate format.

While she has touted her education at Howard University and raised her experience being bused to school as a young girl, her presidential campaign has stressed universality and inclusion. Her “3 a.m. agenda"" has stressed that what keeps us up at night — medical bills, housing, our kids’ education — does not depend on whether one is a Republican or Democrat. She routinely states that “we have so much more in common than what separates us.”

That reticence, by necessity, has receded. Voters demand a level of candor and intimacy from their presidential candidates. To both define her message and defend her record, she has had to explain her tenure as a prosecutor and rebutted claims that she was a cog in the machine of mass incarceration. She’s been obliged to share stories of her experience as a prosecutor comforting mothers whose children have been shot and killed and in instituting anti-bias training for police officers.

AD

AD

Moreover, as the campaign has progressed, Harris has more overtly emphasized her connection to the African American community and posited herself as African Americans’ advocate in the halls of power. This was especially noticeable in her speech Saturday. She spoke of herself as standing on the shoulders of African American giants such as Thurgood Marshall and told the crowd, “We need soldiers in every phase, layer and trench of the movement for social justice.” There is a need to pair outside advocacy with the hard and “frustrating” work of insiders, she argued. To sustain change and promote progress, she said, “We must elect and lift up people to lead who are also immersed in our community, who represent us and our experience, and who know the deep flaws within the systems we serve.” She added, “We need to run into the fire … extinguisher in hand.” In short, it matters for black Americans to have black Americans in power, on the inside.

Who better to knock down “the systemic barriers to racism,” she posits, than someone who understands that system but also has a deep understanding of the challenges facing the African American community as only a member of that community can? We now see her make the explicit case that the outcomes she obtained — e.g., getting jobs for young, low-level drug offenders — were a reflection of her understanding and attachment to the African American community.

For Harris, the address marked a level of candor and earnestness about her identity as an accomplished, African American woman that we have not regularly seen on the trail. In a time of “overt racism,” she presented herself “as only the second black woman elected to the United States Senate and as a serious and top-tier candidate for the president of the United States.”

AD

AD

One can be cynical and say she is more vividly identifying as an African American candidate with an eye toward the critical South Carolina primary and the need to win over African American voters who heavily favor former vice president Joe Biden. However, it would be foolish for Harris to ignore her own identity, her own career and her own experience as she asks voters to take a chance on a first-time candidate for president, a woman still in her first term in the Senate.

All presidential candidates must personalize themselves. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) talks about her Okie upbringing on the “ragged edge” of the middle class. Biden is ""Middle-Class Joe,” and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is the gal from the heartland. Perhaps in fully inhabiting her role as an African American female trailblazer and a progressive insider, Harris’s will find the focus and clarity she needs.

(“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters.)

And Mnuchin said it was “inappropriate” that Biden’s son, Hunter, “did very significant business dealings in Ukraine” while his father was in office, laying out a standard that the Trump family is currently violating, as CNN's “State of the Union” host Jake Tapper pointed out during their interview.

Mnuchin’s advocacy for the president on controversies of all stripes carries real financial risk. He can move markets with his words: The dollar tanked last year when the secretary made some offhand comments that a weak dollar would benefit trade. In the event of an economic crisis, Mnuchin could be called on to reassure the public. His ability to do so would rest on his credibility.

This isn't the first time Mnuchin has advanced controversial arguments in defense of his boss. He was notably outspoken, for example, amid the furor over Trump’s “both sides” comments after the violence in Charlottesville two years ago. At the time, Mnuchin waved off a pressure campaign urging him to resign, including 300 members of his Yale college class. The performance earned him a stinging rebuke from one of his predecessors:

Steven Mnuchin may be the greatest sycophant in Cabinet history. — Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) September 24, 2017

That unblinking loyalty — Mnuchin once said Trump has “perfect genes” — helps explain the Treasury secretary's relative longevity in the Trump administration. Of 16 Cabinet-level positions, only seven officials, including Mnuchin, survive from the president’s original lineup. One of the alums from that roster, former defense secretary Jim Mattis, demonstrated a path easier taken by ex-officials. “This is not something I have background on,” Mattis told ABC’s Martha Raddatz on “This Week,” declining to discuss the matter. Or he could acknowledge the obvious: It would be wrong for the president to pressure a foreign leader to probe a domestic political opponent.

Mnuchin, on the other hand, offered a more aggressive defense of the president than some other Trump surrogates. Whereas Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also appearing on ABC, suggested “it wouldn’t be appropriate” for the White House to release the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, the Treasury secretary went further. He said it would “set a terrible precedent” because “conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.” And if the administration hands it over to Congress, it probably would leak, Mnuchin said.

Trump later in the day told reporters he was considering whether to do so.

MARKET MOVERS

— German economy edges toward recession. WSJ's Paul Hannon: ""Germany’s economy is on the brink of recession, according to a survey of purchasing managers that recorded the sharpest fall in business activity in almost seven years during September, reflecting the deepening hit to factories from the U.S.’s trade war with China and uncertainty around the U.K.’s departure from the European Union.

""The downturn in Europe’s largest economy has been led by its manufacturing sector, which is heavily dependent on exports and has been hit by weakening demand from the U.K., China, Turkey and elsewhere over the past year. But in September the sector experienced an even sharper contraction, as its Purchasing Managers Index slumped to 41.4 from 43.5 in August, hitting its lowest level in more than a decade. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity.""

— Trump's Fed tweets move markets. Bloomberg's Simon Kennedy: ""Trump’s Twitter attacks on the Federal Reserve are prompting investors to bet the central bank will bow to political pressure and lower interest rates, according to a new study. Trump has frequently used social media to criticize the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell for running rates higher than he thinks they should be. A review of such tweets and the market response by economists from Duke University and the London Business School found they have a “statistically significant and negative effect” on markets. The broadsides knocked a combined 10 basis points off the expected fed funds futures contract, the equivalent to about 0.30 basis points per Tweet, the study found.""

— Chinese negotiators cut trip short. CNBC's Yun Li: ""Chinese trade negotiators had a sudden change of plans Friday, canceling a visit to meet U.S. farmers after they wrapped up trade talks in Washington this week. The Chinese delegation has changed its travel schedule and is headed back to China earlier than planned, according to Nicole Rolf, the Montana Farm Bureau Federation’s director of national affairs. There was no explanation as to why they were cutting their trip short, Rolf said.

""Nebraska department of agriculture also said the Chinese officials called off a visit to farms in Nebraska. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue confirmed just Thursday the meetings were in the works as a way for China to build goodwill with American farmers.""

— Trump names China hawk as deputy national security advisor. WSJ's Vivian Salama: ""Trump has chosen one of his leading policy counselors on China and North Korea as his new deputy national security adviser, according to an administration official. Matt Pottinger, who served in the Marines and worked earlier in his career as a China-based correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, will be the No. 2 to Robert O’Brien, who was named as Mr. Trump’s fourth national security adviser earlier this week. The administration official said that Vice President Mike Pence had been advocating for Mr. Pottinger in recent days given his work on some of the biggest policy challenges facing the Trump administration.""

DOJ warns about Chinese IP theft. CNBC's Nancy Hungerford: ""The Department of Justice has a warning for companies: Bolster your defenses. 'More cases are being opened that implicate trade secret theft' — and more of them point to China, said U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey. Since 2012, more than 80% of economic espionage cases brought by the department’s National Security Division have implicated China. The frequency of cases has been rising in recent years, according to Hickey.""

— Adelson reportedly warns Trump about trade war: “[Trump’s] sudden escalation of the trade war with China last month triggered a telephone call from billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who warned the president about the conflict’s impact on the U.S. economy and Mr. Trump’s re-election prospects, according to people familiar with the call,” the Wall Street Journal’s Alex Leary, William Mauldin and Kate O’Keeffe report.

“During his call with Mr. Trump, Mr. Adelson focused on the broader implications of the U.S.-China trade war and their potential political consequences for Mr. Trump, according to one of the people, and not on his own company’s situation. Representatives for Mr. Adelson, a major donor to the Republican Party, have also spoken with members of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, according to this person.”

— One company has filed more than 10,000 tariff waivers: “U.S. companies have filed more than 16,000 requests for exemptions from the $200 billion tranche of tariffs on Chinese goods that the Trump administration imposed one year ago. Of those appeals, over 10,000 have come from just one company: Arrowhead Engineered Products Inc. of Blaine, Minn.,” WSJ’s Josh Zumbrun, Anthony DeBarros and Chad Day report.

“Companies have taken different approaches to the exclusion process. Some have filed only for a few key items. Others have filed single applications that cover many products, especially if those items all fall under the same 10-digit code in the tariff schedule. Trade attorneys and experts have said it isn’t clear which tack is more effective.”

POCKET CHANGE

— Pressure mounts on WeWork’s CEO: “ The knives are out for WeWork CEO Adam Neumann,” Bloomberg News’s Gillian Tan, Sarah McBride, and Michelle Davis report.

“With the drama of a palace coup, some directors are considering a plan to encourage the brash co-founder of the once high-flying real estate startup to step down as chief executive, according to people familiar with the situation. Among them: Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., WeWork’s biggest investor, a person said.”

A board meeting is scheduled for this morning: “ … In what would be a remarkable showdown between the 40-year-old Neumann and his billionaire backer. The directors are said to be considering asking him to become non-executive chairman.”

— Big companies set emissions goals before U.N. summit: “We Mean Business,” a coalition of advocacy groups, said dozens of companies had joined the initiative in the two months leading up to a United Nations summit taking place ... which aims to spur faster action on climate change,” Reuters’s Matthew Green reports. “We Mean Business said 87 companies are now involved, with total market capitalization of more than $2.3 trillion.”

“Some companies in the coalition have agreed to slash their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, including Swiss food company Nestle, French building materials company Saint-Gobain, and French cosmetics maker L’Oreal. This group includes Finnish telecoms company Nokia, French food group Danone and British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, We Mean Business said.”

— Big week ahead for Fannie, Freddie: “Mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expected to start keeping their earnings as early as this week, pausing a yearslong arrangement in which they handed nearly all of their profits to the Treasury Department,” WSJ’s Andrew Ackerman reports.

“The move, in an expected agreement between the Trump administration and their federal regulator, would be an initial major step in allowing the companies to build up capital so they can operate as private companies again. Under the forthcoming agreement, the companies would be allowed to retain about a year’s worth of profits, or about $20 billion, Mark Calabria, the Federal Housing Finance Agency chief, said in an interview after touring a senior center financed in part by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.”

It’s also a key week for the future of Boeing’s 737 Max: “With a crucial summit for the Boeing Co. 737 Max looming this week, regulators are downplaying the threat of a rupture to a decades-old working relationship between U.S. and European aviation authorities,” Bloomberg News’s Julie Johnsson and Alan Levin report.

“On the eve of a gathering of about 50 airworthiness experts in Montreal, the top European regulator, Patrick Ky, suggested that the Max could return to the air in the U.S. and Europe at almost the same time. And officials privately have been discussing whether a critical disagreement over the jet’s architecture could be resolved after it resumes commercial flight, according to people familiar with the talks.”

SCHIFF: Well, Jake, you know I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment, for the reason that I think the founders contemplating, in a country that has elections every four years, that this would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort, not first resort.

But if the president is essentially withholding military aid, at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, that is, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.

We’re going to hear from the director of national intelligence on Thursday why he is the first director to withhold ever a whistleblower complaint. And we are going to make sure that we get that complaint, that whistleblower is protected.

And we're going to make sure that we find out whether the president has engaged in this kind of improper conduct. But it may be that we do have to move forward with that extraordinary remedy, if indeed the president is, at the same time withholding vital military assistance, he is trying to leverage that to obtain impermissible help in his political campaign.

Perhaps because it’s become unsurprising, or maybe because it’s easier to write about clamoring from the left than deflection by the right, far less attention is being paid to the apparent acquiescence of congressional Republicans.

The donnybrook has emerged as the latest test of a famous Trump boast during the 2016 campaign. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn’t lose any voters,” he said.

Each scandal seems to bring a more restrained reaction from GOP leaders. The outcries after Charlottesville and child separation seem like eons ago. Most Republicans went radio silent as new details emerged about Trump using the power of the presidency in an alleged attempt to collude with a foreign power for partisan purposes.

The only prominent elected Republican to speak out this weekend was Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 standard-bearer. And he was measured. “If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” Romney tweeted on Sunday. “Critical for the facts to come out.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, during a single call, the president urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “about eight times” to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on a probe that could hamper Biden’s 2020 campaign. That call took place just one day after Bob Mueller testified on Capitol Hill about his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and Trump’s efforts to hinder that investigation. It came a month after Trump said he would accept help from another country for his 2020 reelection campaign if it was offered. “There’s nothing wrong with listening,” he told ABC News.

On Sunday morning, Trump appeared to say that he brought up Biden with Zelensky. “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House. A few hours later in Houston, the president said he didn’t want to talk about it. “But certainly I’d have the right to,” he added.

Speaking to reporters, Trump also slammed the former vice president for saying that he never spoke with his son about his business dealings in Ukraine. The president said that’s implausible. “He said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Does anybody believe that one?”

For his part, the president has insisted that he never spoke to his son Don Jr. in advance about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that was set up after a Russian lawyer allegedly offered to provide his campaign with dirt on Hillary Clinton. In the Mueller report, the president’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he recalled being in Trump’s office when the son talked about a meeting to get “adverse information” on Clinton. Cohen told Mueller’s team that it appeared that father and son had previously discussed the subject. Mueller never interviewed Trump or Trump Jr.

A year later, in June 2017, the president personally dictated the statement in which his son claimed that the Trump Tower meeting a year before was “primarily” about “the adoption of Russian children.” Emails disclosed a few days later showed clearly that was not why Don Jr. agreed to the meeting.

-- With this do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do presidency, it’s more important to watch what Trump does than what he says. The president also claimed on Sunday, for example, that he would “love” to release the transcript of his call. This soundbite played prominently in many news accounts, but it doesn’t pass the smell test. If the transcript vindicated him, Trump could – and almost certainly would – release it. But the White House has played an active role in preventing acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire from complying with congressional demands for the material in the underlying whistleblower complaint, which the law says should be turned over.

“White House counsel Pat Cipollone has been engaged in the matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, officials said, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump,” Matt Zapotosky, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig reported on Friday. “The issue has become a source of tension between the White House and the office of the DNI, with Maguire forced into the position of fending off lawmakers’ demands — citing jurisdictional objections — while the White House avoids asserting executive privilege or taking a clear legal position.”

-- Trump’s surrogates on the Sunday shows made clear that the transcript won’t be forthcoming, at least not without a fight. “Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn’t be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on ABC. “There’s no evidence that that would be appropriate here at this point.”

“I think it would be highly inappropriate to release a transcript of a call between two world leaders,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on NBC, adding that foreign governments “expect that they are kept confidential.”

One factor in John Bolton’s recent ouster as national security adviser was reportedly his unwillingness to blindly defend Trump on the Sunday shows, particularly the president’s desire to invite the Taliban to Camp David on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary. Mnuchin and Pompeo appear to have no such qualms.

After Mnuchin criticized Hunter Biden for doing business in Ukraine, he got mealy-mouthed when CNN’s Jake Tapper asked if that means he thinks it’s not okay for Don Jr. and Eric Trump to do business all over the world and for Ivanka Trump to get copyrights approved by foreign governments. “I don’t really want to go into more of these details,” Mnuchin protested.

-- With an election year approaching, many top Republicans on Capitol Hill quickly circled the wagons. Borrowing from the Roy Cohn playbook, they tried to play offense. “The president and his close allies also escalated their attacks on Biden on Sunday, demanding probes into the former vice president and his son’s work in Ukraine, though no evidence has surfaced that Biden acted inappropriately and Trump’s allies did not provide any,” Seung Min Kim and Felicia Sonmez report. “Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called for the Justice Department to play a role in the matter, arguing that it should ‘look at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,’ in a reference to Mueller’s Russia probe. … On Sunday, Giuliani attacked Joe Biden in deeply personal terms by referencing Hunter Biden’s struggles with addiction. ‘The kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict,’ Giuliani said on ‘Fox News Sunday.’” (Our fact checker team this morning challenges the latest claims by Trump and his team about Biden and Ukraine.)

-- Meanwhile, several Republicans who are uncomfortable with Trump are quietly leaving office rather than drawing his ire by speaking out. Rachael Bade has a deep dive in today’s newspaper on the 18 House GOP retirements. The most poignant example is Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.): “Moments after Trump’s July 14 missive telling four U.S. congresswomen of color to ‘go back’ to their countries of origin, the congressman from Michigan phoned a fellow House GOP leader and asked him to get Trump to stop. … Three days later, Mitchell was awaiting a prime-time CNN appearance when he saw footage of Trump rallygoers chanting ‘send her back,’ aimed at one of the congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Stunned, Mitchell said he scribbled question marks on a notepad to silently ask an aide: ‘How do I even respond to this on TV?’ But one of the final straws was the unwillingness of people in Trump’s orbit to listen.

“Mitchell implored Vice President Pence, his chief of staff, Marc Short, and ‘any human being that has any influence in the White House’ to arrange a one-on-one conversation between him and the president so he could express his concerns. It never happened. And 10 days after the Trump tweet, Mitchell — a two-term lawmaker who thought he’d be in Congress for years to come — announced his retirement. ‘We’re here for a purpose — and it’s not this petty, childish b------t,’ Mitchell, 62, said in an interview …

“Since Trump’s inauguration, a Washington Post analysis shows, nearly 40 percent of the 241 Republicans who were in office in January 2017 are gone or leaving … The vast turnover is a reminder of just how much Trump has remade the GOP — and of the purge of those who dare to oppose him. … All told, 41 House Republicans have left national politics or announced they won’t seek reelection in the nearly three years since Trump took office. That dwarfs the 25 Democrats who retired in the first four years of former president Barack Obama’s tenure — and Republicans privately predict this is only the beginning. Most of the departing Republicans publicly cite family as the reason for leaving. But behind the scenes, Republicans say the trend highlights a greater pessimism about the direction of the party under Trump — and their ability to win back the House next year. …

“One Republican aide close to Rep. Martha Roby … said the Alabamian decided to retire in part because she was tired of pretending she backed Trump. … A former House Republican close with Rep. Susan Brooks said she also has struggled with Trump’s tone, though the Indiana Republican pushed back on the suggestion that frustration with Trump was the reason for her retirement. … Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said Trump’s tweets are ‘more divisive’ than he would like, but the former Natural Resources Committee chairman said he’s leaving because … [he] is term-limited on the panel. Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), another retiring member, declined to say whether he had any problems with Trump. … ‘If the party doesn’t start looking like America, there will not be a party in America,’ said Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), the only black House Republican, who announced his retirement in August.”

-- Most Republicans, however, are choosing to just stay quiet and keep their heads down. “You might think that Republicans who have made national security their calling card since the Reagan era might finally hit the limits of their cravenness in the face of a whistleblower’s bravery. But the party, our politics and our media system are too broken for the old norms to apply,” writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

“Even Republican politicians who know how dangerous this situation is thus prefer to stay in their bunkers and hope to survive,” he adds in his column for today’s newspaper. “The GOP’s electorate is dominated by Trump’s supporters. Staying mum provides protection from opponents inside their own party — and from their own voters. And if they broke ranks, Trump’s media allies would attack them viciously. By playing for time, these taciturn Republicans will be able to tell us once Trump is gone how they knew all along just how bad he was. But when the greatest threat to our country is the corruption of our constitutional system, might at least some of the GOP’s leading politicians decide that there are worse things than losing a primary, or being upbraided by Fox News?”

-- Trump seems to be daring House Democrats to impeach him, and they seem increasingly inclined to take up the challenge. “We very well may have crossed the Rubicon here,” said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment,” he explained on CNN. “But if the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents. … We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. If there’s a fire burning, it needs to be put out, and that's why we’re going to have to look at every remedy. … We're going to have to consider impeachment … as a remedy here.”

-- This is a striking quote because Schiff, an ally of Nancy Pelosi, really has been heretofore cautious. The speaker herself sent a letter to all her House colleagues warning that the acting director of national intelligence must turn over the whistleblower complaint detailing Trump’s interactions with Ukraine. “If the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” she wrote.

-- This letter, while avoiding the I-word, should be a read as a shot across the bow of the White House, and it’s a reflection of the bubbling-over frustration that Pelosi has been hearing from many of her members. “She and Schiff were in touch throughout the weekend, syncing up strategies and talking points,” Bade and Josh Dawsey report. “An increasingly vocal group of pro-impeachment House Democrats are starting to dismiss their own oversight of Trump as feckless, even accusing their colleagues of emboldening the president by refusing to stand up to what they see as lawless behavior. …

“With Pelosi unwilling to impeach Trump, Democratic rank-and-file members are frantically looking for something to fortify their investigations. On Friday, Judiciary members pressed [committee chairman Jerry Nadler] to invoke Congress’s long-dormant inherent contempt authority that would allow Congress to jail or fine people for defying subpoenas, an idea he supports … The power hasn’t been used in nearly 100 years. Pelosi, leadership and other House lawyers were dismissive of the idea when investigators first floated it in the spring. But Judiciary members are once again trying to force the issue and are planning to make the matter a big focus of the coming week.”

A notable quote from their story: “Our side says it’s ‘legally questionable,’ ‘it hasn’t been used in forever,’ and ‘blah, blah, blah,’ ” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a member of the panel, who argues Trump’s legal team frequently has used last-ditch efforts and bogus explanations to block testimony — and the House should do the same. “I say do it. Let them argue in court that they take the position that it’s legally questionable. We back off of everything! We’ve been very weak.”

-- A founding member of the Squad, who has supported impeachment, said this weekend that it’s become scandalous that Democrats won’t try to impeach Trump:

At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him.



The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it.



The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

-- “Several first-term lawmakers who had opposed impeachment conferred privately over the weekend to discuss announcing support for an inquiry, potentially jointly, after a hearing scheduled for Thursday with the acting national intelligence director,” per the New York Times. “A handful of them declined to speak on the record over the weekend, with some still reluctant to go public and others looking for cues from Ms. Pelosi and their freshman colleagues. … Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said once a transcript is made public of Mr. Trump pressuring Mr. Zelensky, she doubted that even Democrats from competitive seats could continue to resist impeachment.”

-- The whistleblower story is likely to dominate the news again this week. Trump arrived in New York last night for the United Nations General Assembly, where he is scheduled to meet with Zelensky – the Ukrainian leader – on Wednesday. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify publicly on Thursday before Schiff’s committee.

-- Conservatives who don’t hold elected office have been far more willing to criticize Trump. “We don’t yet know the full details because of White House stonewalling, but from what we already know, this may be the most shocking revelation of wrongdoing by Trump since he fired FBI Director James B. Comey on May 9, 2017, (by his own admission) to squelch the investigation of his Russia ties,” writes columnist Max Boot, a leading Trump critic on the right. “If there were any justice in the world, this would mark a turning point where Democrats find the courage to impeach and Republicans find the decency to stop defending the indefensible. Instead, so far we are getting a rerun of previous scandals characterized by Trump’s brazenness, Republicans’ servility and Democrats’ pusillanimity.”

-- HBO’s “Game of Thrones” won its final Emmy for outstanding drama series in an awards show that demonstrated how great TV shows are doing right now, writes our TV critic Hank Stuever. “Fleabag” took home the awards for best comedy series, best actress in a comedy series, comedy writing and comedy directing. Other highlights of this year’s show:

Billy Porter became the first openly gay man to win an Emmy for best drama actor. Onstage, Porter said: “The category is love, y’all.” And he quoted James Baldwin: “It took many years of vomiting up all the filth that I had been taught about myself and halfway believed before I could walk around the Earth like I have the right to be here.”

2020 WATCH:

-- A major milestone: The Des Moines Register's poll, released Saturday night, showed Elizabeth Warren edging out Biden in Iowa. The survey is within the margin of error, but marks the first time the former vice president hasn't been on top in such a respected early-state poll. The Register breaks down the results of the survey, which it conducted with CNN: “Warren’s slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator’s many plans and policies, Iowa experts say. … Twenty-two percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers say Warren is their first choice for president, compared with 20% for Biden and 11% for [Bernie Sanders]. No other candidate reaches double digits. It’s the first major shakeup in the polling standings, said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. ... Lara Henderson, who was state director for U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s now-ended Iowa caucus campaign, said that while other candidates have had viral moments or quick bursts of national attention, Warren’s team has excelled at capturing those moments and turning them into on-the-ground support.""

“ The poll also revealed some vulnerabilities for Warren: Her supporters are not completely locked in. According to the poll, just 12% of Warren’s backers say they are fully committed to caucusing for her, and 88% say they could still be persuaded to support someone else.""

According to the poll, just 12% of Warren’s backers say they are fully committed to caucusing for her, and 88% say they could still be persuaded to support someone else."" “ Biden has fallen from 32% last December to 20% today. In that time, his favorability rating also has fallen: 82% of likely Democratic caucusgoers had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%. …

In that time, his favorability rating also has fallen: 82% of likely Democratic caucusgoers had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%. … “The portion of likely Democratic caucusgoers who say [Pete Buttigieg] is their first choice for president has dropped by 6 percentage points since the June poll , from 15% to 9%.""

, from 15% to 9%."" “Sanders, too, has stumbled, falling from a high of 25% in March to 11% today. Even among those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016, 25% say they will do so again. He loses 32% of his 2016 supporters to Warren and 12% to Buttigieg.”

-- The Register poll underscores how much of a problem Warren is for Sanders. Sean Sullivan, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Chelsea Janes report: “She is winning a bigger share of people who caucused for Sanders in 2016 than he is, and she is outpacing him among those under 35, his former strong suit, according to the survey … Sanders campaign officials, dismissing the notion that their candidate is struggling, vowed Sunday to plow ahead with aggressive moves to win the Iowa caucuses. … Sanders will embark Monday on a ‘Bernie Beats Trump’ tour across the state, an effort to argue that he is the most electable choice against President Trump in 2020. But his more immediate obstacle is Warren, whom he has refrained from criticizing, though some of his surrogates have been more aggressive.""

-- An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found a record share of voters both personally dislike Trump and harbor doubts about some of the liberal policies backed by Sanders and Warren. Biden also faces questions about his fitness for the job. From NBC News: “A record 50 percent say they dislike [Trump] personally and dislike his policies, while another 19 percent say that they dislike him but approve of his policies. … Half of voters — 49 percent — say they’re very uncomfortable with his 2020 candidacy. That’s compared to 41 percent who say the same for Sanders and 33 percent apiece who say the same for Biden or Warren. … Among Democratic primary voters, 64 percent say they support providing government health care to undocumented immigrants, while just 36 percent of all registered voters agree. A similar share of Democratic voters — 63 percent — support a single payer ‘Medicare-for-All’ style plan, also backed by Warren and Sanders, that would replace the existing private insurance system. Among voters overall, just 41 percent support that idea.”

-- Cory Booker’s campaign made a stark announcement on Saturday: He needs to bring in $1.7 million in 10 days, his campaign manager Addisu Demissie said, or else he will probably drop out. Without that haul before the end of the third fundraising quarter, Demissie wrote in a memo, “we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.” BuzzFeed News reports: “The decision to state this publicly — framed by Booker campaign officials as a show of ‘radical transparency,’ an honest, vulnerable ‘call for help’ when most campaigns just project strength all the time, even falsely — came both suddenly, as a shock, and slowly, as an inevitable fact. Booker, the 50-year-old New Jersey senator and former Newark mayor, talks with confidence about his team’s ‘slow and steady’ approach to the Democratic primary. It’s ‘tortoise and the hare,’ his aides say. ... There’s a sense, watching Booker’s campaign, that their strategy is also incumbent upon a moment — a fact that can create some dissonance between his public confidence and the reality that, almost eight months into his presidential bid, that moment has yet to arrive.”

-- A few Democratic candidates hastily arranged visits to picket lines for the United Auto Workers. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “On Thursday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told Detroit autoworkers they should be rewarded for making concessions ‘when this company was in some bad straits.’ On Sunday, Biden spoke to a local union in Kansas City, Kan., and [Warren] picketed with workers in Detroit. Sanders plans to visit in coming days.""

-- The Alaska GOP canceled its 2020 Republican presidential primary, joining Nevada, South Carolina and Kansas. (Time)

-- Trump’s campaign team is increasingly grim about his ability to carry Michigan again in 2020. Politico’s Alex Isenstadt reports from a GOP confab on Mackinac Island: “After a midterm election that decimated the ranks of Michigan Republicans, Trump's campaign is looking to other battlegrounds he lost last time — such as Minnesota and New Hampshire — that they see as more promising. … Republican officials say they're planning a substantial investment in Michigan, with 20 full-time staffers expected to be deployed to the state by the end of the year.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- India’s Narendra Modi lavished praise on his American counterpart as the leaders of the world’s two largest democracies took the stage together in Houston before a roaring crowd of tens of thousands of Indian Americans. Philip Rucker reports: “Trump swooped into Houston on Sunday with an unusual role: as a warm-up act. Called ‘Howdy, Modi!,’ the event was staged to honor the prime minister and was billed as the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader other than the pope … ‘His name is familiar to every person on the planet,’ Modi said as he introduced Trump. … The prime minister then repurposed his own campaign slogan in India to rally support for ‘my friend’ Trump in the United States: ‘Abki baar, Trump sarkar,’ meaning, ‘This time, a Trump government.’ …

“The two strode onto the stage holding hands. … Trump delivered remarks — and, unlike at his own campaign rallies, did not appear to stray from his script on Teleprompters. The president highlighted his stewardship of the economy, but drew far most impassioned responses from the crowd when he talked about other issues. The president received a standing ovation when he denounced ‘radical Islamic terrorism,’ and sustained applause when he vowed to stop illegal immigration. … Trump made a direct pitch to expand his share of support among Indian Americans in his 2020 reelection.""

-- As her first General Assembly begins, Trump’s new U.N. ambassador, Kelly Craft, faces crises from climate change and North Korea’s missile launches to Venezuela’s hunger crisis and a potential conflict with Iran. Carol Morello reports: “Craft is up to the task, her allies say. … ‘Looking ahead, I plan to remind the other nations of the U.N. that the United States isn’t going anywhere,’ [Craft said]. ‘As we demand more of the U.N., and more equitable burden-sharing among members, we will also continue to press for real action to advance human rights, women’s empowerment, health and wellbeing, etc.’”

-- Trump likely faces an uphill battle in mobilizing international pressure against Iran at the U.N. assembly. From the Journal: “A senior administration official said the U.S. plans to make Iran’s ‘exploratory violence’ a theme of this week’s U.N. General Assembly, following Iran’s alleged strike on the Saudi energy facilities. … Western diplomats, however, said they have been given no indication yet that the U.S. intends to push for action by the U.N. Security Council, which has the authority to impose sanctions and authorize military action. At the U.N., the process developing resolutions capable of winning support on the 15-member council can take weeks. … In a further complication for U.S. diplomatic efforts, Russia is leading the Security Council in September, and Russia and China have veto authority in the body. Neither is considered likely to favor biting economic measures, let alone concerted military action.”

-- The United Kingdom has concluded that Iran is responsible for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities. From the AP: Prime Minister Boris Johnson “said the U.K. would consider taking part in a U.S.-led military effort to bolster the Gulf kingdom’s defenses. ... [But] the Conservative prime minister also said the U.K. would work with allies to ‘de-escalate’ Middle East tensions that have soared since the Sept. 14 attack on the world’s largest oil processor and an oil field. Britain had previously held back from attributing blame for the drone and missile attack. Saudi Arabia and the United States say Iran was responsible.”

-- Johnson said Brits shouldn’t get their hopes up for a “New York breakthrough” on Brexit. From Politico Europe: “Speaking on his RAF Voyager plane as he flew into New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, the U.K. prime minister insisted that despite the downbeat assessment, he is not ‘getting pessimistic.’ He said his overall hopes for a deal remain ‘cautiously optimistic.’ … Johnson said there are ‘clearly still gaps and still difficulties’ in the negotiations but that he still holds out hope a deal could be secured by October 31, when the U.K. is meant to leave the bloc.”

-- An alliance of Arab Israeli parties threw its support behind Benjamin Netanyahu’s rival, Benny Gantz, to lead Israel. Ruth Eglash reports: “In a historic move, an alliance of Arab Israeli parties recommended a prime ministerial candidate to President Reuven Rivlin for the first time in almost three decades … Arab parties traditionally refrain from recommending a candidate during consultations as an ideological protest of Israel’s ongoing military occupation of the Palestinians. The last time an Arab party backed a candidate during consultations was in 1992, when Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister. Rabin later signed the historic Oslo accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.”

-- Hong Kong protesters are targeting Beijing-friendly businesses in their latest demonstrations. Timothy McLaughlin and Casey Quackenbush report: “The new tactic showed a simmering anger toward the city’s business elites, a relatively small group of tycoons and cronies who have accumulated enormous wealth and political clout, often through cozy relationships with the mainland. … Hundreds of protesters gathered at New Town Plaza, a multistory shopping mall in the Sha Tin district. They targeted Chinese-linked businesses such as Maxim’s Jade Garden restaurant, flooding the automated reservation system with requests and taping the receipts together to create an ad hoc protest banner. … By evening, in what has been a recurring pattern in the weekend protests, demonstrations that began peacefully turned violent.”

-- The protests are threatening to rain on China’s anniversary parade. Anna Fifield reports: “The Communist Party is ready to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1 with the kind of military extravaganza that only Stalinist states can pull off. It ought to be a particularly sweet anniversary for China’s leaders: Their Communist state has now lasted longer than the Soviet Union, which endured for 69 years. But it is not. The months-long standoff between the party and the millions who have been protesting in Hong Kong is set to come to a head on Oct. 1, when the demonstrators plan to stage a counter-rally. ‘A confrontation of monumental proportions is coming up,’ said Orville Schell, a China specialist at the Asia Society. ‘Clearly, something will happen on Oct. 1.’”

-- Indonesian investigators determined that design and oversight lapses played a central role in the fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max jet last year. From the Wall Street Journal: “The draft conclusions ... also identify a string of pilot errors and maintenance mistakes as causal factors in the fatal plunge of the Boeing Co. plane into the Java Sea, echoing a preliminary report from Indonesia last year. … Details of the Indonesian report ... are subject to change and further analysis. Indonesian investigators declined to comment, except to say the final document is likely to come out in early November. … U.S. air-crash investigators are preparing to make public a handful of separate safety recommendations, ranging from bolstering the manual flying skills of pilots to enhancing FAA vetting of new aircraft designs.”

-- The World Health Organization accused Tanzania of withholding information about suspected Ebola cases. Max Bearak reports: “The U.N. agency’s statement Saturday was its most pointed rebuke toward any government yet during the outbreak that has ravaged nearby eastern Congo for more than a year, killing more than 2,000 people. The WHO was made aware of the suspected cases in Tanzania shortly after one appeared this month in Dar es Salaam, the East African country’s largest city and former capital. After that, the international organization was shut out of blood sample testing and told by the government that Ebola had been ruled out, it said. Tanzanian authorities have not offered alternative diagnoses.”

-- Italy will take in migrants from the Ocean Viking rescue ship. More than a hundred migrants rescued by aid organizations SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders will be allowed to disembark in Italy, making it the second time this month that the European country has allowed the NGO permission to dock.

DIVIDED AMERICA:

-- If you read only one story today, make it this: “Immigrant kids fill this town’s schools. Their bus driver is leading the backlash,” by Michael Miller in Worthington, Minn.: “It was the first day of school, so Don Brink was behind the wheel of his bus, its yellow paint glistening in the drizzling dawn. Wearing jeans and a John Deere cap, he turned the radio to an oldies station and, with hands callused thick by 50 years of farming, steered the vehicle toward the edge of town. He stopped in front of familiar farmhouses surrounded by fields of soy and corn, where blond children boarded the bus, chatting in English. ‘Morning,’ the 71-year-old Vietnam veteran said. This was the Worthington he knew.

“But then Brink headed back into town, past the meatpacking plant that was the area’s main employer and into the neighborhood he called Little Mexico, even though most of its residents were Central American. This was the Worthington he did not know — the Worthington he resented. … Brink said nothing. ‘I say ‘good morning’ to the kids who’ll respond to me,’ he said later. ‘But this year there are a lot of strange kids I’ve never seen before.’ Those children, some of whom crossed the U.S.-Mexico border alone, have fueled a bitter debate about immigration in Worthington, a community of 13,000 that has received more unaccompanied minors per capita than almost anywhere in the country…

“Five times in just over five years, the district has asked residents to approve an expansion of its schools to handle the surge in enrollment. Five times, the voters have refused — the last time by a margin of just 17 votes. A sixth referendum is scheduled for November. The divide can be felt all over Worthington, where ‘Minnesota nice’ has devolved into ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ window signs, boycotts on businesses and next-door neighbors who no longer speak. A Catholic priest who praised immigrants was booed from the pews and has received death threats. The driving force behind the defeats has been a handful of white farmers in this Trump-supporting county, including Brink, the bus driver. Even as he earns a paycheck ferrying undocumented children to and from school, Brink opposes the immigration system that allowed them to come to Worthington. ...

“In 2013, when the school district first asked voters to pay for new classrooms amid the influx of unaccompanied minors, those farmers feared they would bear the brunt of the $39 million. The bond referendum failed Three years later, when the school district asked for $79 million, some locals felt insulted … Attitudes have only hardened since then ... Accusations of racism have become commonplace. … ‘On a weekly basis I’m told I hate children,’ said [David] Bosma, 37, whose kids go to a private Christian school. ‘I’m just a young guy trying to make a living for myself and put food on the table for my family. I look at the bank account at end of the month and say, can I afford another $200 in property taxes this year?’ Brink also insists he isn’t prejudiced. His own grandparents were immigrants from Holland, and his parents spoke some Dutch. But he doesn’t believe Worthington should be a destination for the undocumented. ‘I wish they would have another ICE raid,’ he said. ‘They need to get rid of the illegals.’”

-- Farmers caught in the crossfire of Trump’s trade wars have grown increasingly dependent on the billions in federal handouts. “At $28 billion so far, the farm rescue is more than twice as expensive as the 2009 bailout of Detroit’s Big Three automakers, which cost taxpayers $12 billion,"" per Bloomberg News. ""And farmers expect the money to keep flowing: In an August survey by Purdue University and the CME Group, 58% said they anticipate another round of trade aid next year. … For American producers, the hit to exports has further strained finances that are at a breaking point because of a six-year slump in prices for agricultural commodities. Net farm income is projected to be down 29% this year from 2013 levels, and debt to total $416 billion. … The bailout funds won’t cover all of farmers’ losses. Producers in Iowa received $973 million in direct payments from the first round of trade aid covering a period in which Iowa State University estimated the trade war cost them $1.7 billion.”

-- Despite growing up in a gun-toting family and representing a rural swath of Virginia, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is all-in on gun control. It's a sign of how the times are changing. Jenna Portnoy reports: “The freshman congresswoman is backing a raft of gun-control measures, and not only those with bipartisan support, such as universal background checks and 'red flag' laws that would temporarily take guns from people deemed to be dangerous. She also wants to ban military-style weapons. A Democrat who unseated Republican Dave Brat in the suburbs outside Richmond last year, Spanberger is unabashed in her position on guns, which she says is largely in sync with the voters in her conservative district. … Constituents have been calling offices in tears begging for action, she said. ‘This is just grossly political, and people are dying because of it,’ she said. ‘The Senate is willing to not uphold the will of the American people, and it’s all political. It’s shameful.’”

-- Vice President Pence drove through Michigan’s Mackinac Island this weekend in an eight-vehicle motorcade, the first ever on the island. When Gerald Ford visited for a working vacation in July 1975, the sitting president traveled by carriage to the Grand Hotel. Some locals were unsettled by Pence's break with tradition, Gillian Brockell reports: “Motorized vehicles have been banned there since 1898, after carriage drivers complained the sound of ‘horseless carriages’ would scare their horses. There are some exceptions: Emergency vehicles are always allowed, and construction vehicles can motor on the island with a permit. Motorized wheelchairs are permitted in accordance with the American Disabilities Act.""

-- Climate activists plan to block streets throughout D.C. today to draw attention to climate change. Hannah Natanson reports: “The protest is timed to coincide with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, at which climate activists and leaders, including 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, are slated to speak. It follows a strike across six continents Friday and a youth conference at the United Nations on Saturday. The traffic shutdown is meant to send a particular message to D.C.'s powerful political elite, according to Liz Butler, an organizer for Shut Down D.C. and vice president of organizing and strategic allegiances for Friends of the Earth.”

-- Local jurisdictions are experimenting with new ways to deal with Confederate monuments: Placing explanatory panels on or next to the statues detailing the history behind them. Natanson reports: “‘This monument should no longer stand as a memorial to white brotherhood,’ reads a sign erected this summer alongside a Confederate statue in Georgia. ‘This monument … fostered a culture of segregation by implying that public spaces and public memory belonged to whites,’ reads another. Declares a third: ‘This ignores the segregation and disenfranchisement of African Americans.’ … Proponents of installing explanatory markers say that — especially in states where removal is illegal — the tactic is realistic, inexpensive and swiftly achievable. Some go further, arguing that the signs are the best tactic, period.”

-- An Orlando, Fla., police officer arrested a 6-year-old after she threw a tantrum in class. Allyson Chiu reports: “Meralyn Kirkland couldn’t believe what she was being told. The caller on Thursday had a message about her granddaughter, Kaia Rolle. The 6-year-old had been arrested at her Orlando charter school and was going to be taken to a juvenile facility. … The Orlando Police Department said it is now investigating actions taken by Dennis Turner, the school resource officer who arrested Kaia and an 8-year-old student in separate events on the same day last week. Turner is accused of not following the department’s policy regarding juvenile arrests … According to the policy, any arrests of minors under the age of 12 needs approval from a supervisor … Authorities declined to identify the two children who were arrested or disclose details about their cases, only noting that they were both students at a local charter school and charged with misdemeanors. Their arrests have renewed scrutiny on policing in schools, which advocates and studies say often unfairly targets students of color and those with disabilities, landing the young people in handcuffs for routine misbehavior.”

-- An Oregon lawmaker said her daughter was “racially profiled by a mall cop,” and now she’s calling for a “loiter-in.” Katie Shepherd reports: “When a mall security guard tapped on her car window, 17-year-old Christine Bynum didn’t know what she and her two friends had done wrong. … ‘We were sitting in the car for no more than 20 minutes, when a very authoritative mall cop circled around the car,’ Christine told The Post in a text message... The girls, who are black, were drinking chocolate milk, eating Kit Kat bars and looking at homecoming dresses on Pinterest, she said. The security guard told the girls the mall had ‘very strict policies for loitering,’ said Christine ... ‘We didn’t even know what the word meant,’ Christine told her mother, Oregon state Rep. Janelle Bynum (D). … On Sunday, the state legislator took to social media to encourage people in her district to show up at the Clackamas Town Center mall for a ‘loiter-in’ over the next week, suggesting that people should wait in the food court, sit on benches in the mall and scroll through their social media accounts in the parking lot. ‘Go see how long it takes to be asked to leave the mall by mall security,’ Bynum wrote. ‘Let’s figure out if there’s a difference between loitering or being the wrong color.’”

President Donald Trump doubled down on his call to investigate Vice President Joe Biden. (Ron Sachs/Pool)

At The White House

THE LATEST ON UKRAINE: President Trump admitted yesterday that he mentioned former vice president Joe Biden during a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Refresher: The Post first reported last week that Trump pressured Zelensky on the call to investigate a gas company with ties to Hunter Biden — the subject of a whistleblower’s complaint. The call coincides with the Trump administration withholding $250 million of military and intelligence aid to Ukraine.

There is no evidence that Trump mentioned the aid as leverage on the call with the new Ukrainian leader but the administration only greenlit the aid last week after the whistleblower's complaint spilled into public view.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

Later on in the day, Trump told reporters in Houston that he'd “have the right” to mention Biden's name with Zelensky and that he'd “love” to release a transcript of the call: “I’m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son … Joe’s got a lot of problems. Joe’s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing,” suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.”

“I’m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son … Joe’s got a lot of problems. Joe’s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing,” suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.” Reminder: There is no evidence that Biden committed any wrongdoing.

Full-court press: Trump's admission came hours after senior members of his administration pulled off a full-court press on the Sunday shows, arguing they supported investigating whether Biden may have participated in “corrupt” behavior.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended Trump’s conversation with Zelensky and claimed it would be inappropriate to publish the transcript between the two leaders.

“America cannot have our elections interfered with. … If there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I would say these are confidential discussions between two foreign leaders but I think the bigger issue is Biden came out this weekend saying he never had any discussions with his son. His son came out and said he had had business discussions with his father so I think that the real issue is not what the president said, but what, indeed, did Biden’s son do,” Mnuchin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

All eyes on UNGA: Trump is scheduled to meet with Zelensky this week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.

As for Biden, he finally responded to Trump's claims over the weekend:

Let’s be clear, Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections. It goes against everything the United States stands for.

On The Hill

Changing minds: The fallout from the episode is unlikely to subside in the immediate future as some House Democrats who have resisted calls to initiate an impeachment inquiry are now changing course. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has also refused to hand over the whistleblower's complaint to Congress and this could all come to a head on Thursday, when he is slated to testify publicly before the House Intelliegence Committee. The DNI's inspector general will testify before the committee behind closed doors.

“No director of national intelligence has ever refused to turn over a whistleblower complaint,” Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.”

The most important voice: “If the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Democrats.

""The growing calls to impeach Trump — or do something bold to confront the White House — follows an embarrassing week for House Democrats,"" my collaegue Rachael Bade reports. ""Many feel increasingly helpless in fighting the White House’s obstruction, as Pelosi looks to the courts to uphold congressional subpoenas, a process that has taken months and could drag out for years.""

Inherent contempt: Some House Democrats were fed up after Corey Lewandowski's in-your-face testimony last week, and urged invoking little-used powers to jail or fine people who defy subpoenas. “I say do it,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), according to Rachael. “Let them argue in court that they take the position that it’s legally questionable. We back off of everything! We’ve been very weak.”

Impeachment: Pelosi might not have used the word impeachment in the letter but Schiff went further than he has when it comes to the ""I"" word. Notably, he spoke with Pelosi spoke over the weekend “to coordinate their statements,” per the New York Times's Nick Fandos, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman.

“I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment,” Schiff said on CNN's 'State of the Union'. “But if the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents.”

What's giving House Dems some more confidence about impeachment? They're hearing it a bit more in their districts. Three House Ds from v diff parts of the country all told us the same on Sunday. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 23, 2019

From the right: Several senior Republican lawmakers surprisingly broke with the party line and called for the administration to release the transcript of Trump's call.

“I’m hoping the president can share, in an appropriate way, information to deal with the drama around the phone call,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told the Times. “I think it would be good for the country if we could deal with it.”

“If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted.

Nevertheless, it's unlikely that Republicans will publicly challenge Trump on the issue. Eighteen House Republicans to date have ""announced plans to resign, retire or run for another office,"" my colleague Rachael Bade reports -- ""a reminder of just how much Trump has remade the GOP — and of the purge of those who dare to oppose him.""

“We’re here for a purpose — and it’s not this petty, childish b------t,” Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), 62, told Rachael an interview in early September of his decision to retire after Trump's tweet telling four U.S. congresswomen to ""go back"" to their countries of origin.

WHO ISN'T COMING TO THE UNGA CLIMATE SUMMIT: U.N. Secretary General António Guterres is today holding a special climate summit in which he has demanded that participating countries “bring with them promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of coal-fired power plants,” report Brady Dennis and Steve Mufson. The summit is taking place as part of the U.N. General Assembly annual meeting this week in New York.

Key quote: "" “I told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,” Guterres told reporters this week. “We are losing the race against climate change. Our world is off track.”

“I told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,” Guterres told reporters this week. “We are losing the race against climate change. Our world is off track.” Not coming: “U.N. officials have said that only the countries that have promised meaningful new pledges — probably about 60 nations — will be allowed one of the three-minute speaking slots throughout the day,” Steven writes. “The United States isn't one of them.”

“U.N. officials have said that only the countries that have promised meaningful new pledges — probably about 60 nations — will be allowed one of the three-minute speaking slots throughout the day,” Steven writes. “The United States isn't one of them.” But: The administration will attend UNGA (Trump is expected to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines).

Steven provided Power Up with some other insights on the week ahead — namely the contrasts between the Obama administration and Trump administration on climate change:

“The meeting at the UN general assembly and climate sessions couldn't be more different,” Steven wrote us in an email. “President Trump has declared that he will withdraw from the Paris accord just as soon as possible -- which happens to be the day after the 2020 election. But that is just a formality. The Trump administration is already busy trying to roll back Obama era regulations and legislation. And the president has praised Brazil's new president, who favors development of the Amazon, and used most of his firepower with China on trade.

But that is just a formality. The Trump administration is already busy trying to roll back Obama era regulations and legislation. And the president has praised Brazil's new president, who favors development of the Amazon, and used most of his firepower with China on trade. For President Obama, the negotiations on climate change were among the high points of his diplomatic record. He corralled a group of difficult allies — China, India and Brazil — to make unprecedented commitments to slow or reverse greenhouse gas emissions. Those countries might have been upset that the United States had already emitted far more, but they bit their tongues and joined the international accord reached in December 2015.”

One glaring example of the sea change will be the absence of the United States from the podium Monday. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has demanded that the countries attending Monday’s summit bring with them promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of coal-fired power plants.”

Instead of attending today's climate meeting, Trump is hosting a session on religious persecution. Elsewhere, activists aim to shutdown the D.C. commute as a way to draw attention to climate change, our colleague Hannah Natanson reports.

The Campaign

SANDERS IS IN TROUBLE: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ""has begun to eclipse [Sen. Bernie] Sanders’s once-dominant standing among the Democratic Party’s most liberal voters and surpass him in some polls in the first two states in the nominating process: Iowa and New Hampshire,"" our colleagues Sean Sullivan, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Chelsea Janes report.

This comes at a bad time for Bernie: ""These challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders’s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign quietly fired its Iowa political director in the late summer and has yet to name a replacement — a key vacancy as the race enters a crucial phase, with less than five months to go before the February caucuses,"" our colleagues write.

And the gold standard of Iowa polls didn't allay those fears: ""The poll provided the clearest indication yet that Warren is eating into his base.

Trump, according to reporting from The Post and the Wall Street Journal,… [+12571 chars]",A look at how Trump's team is spinning the new controversy.,2019-09-23,The Washington Post,Trump’s allies have found the real culprit in this Ukraine mess: Everyone except Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/23/trumps-allies-have-found-real-culprit-this-ukraine-mess-everyone-except-trump/,"Biden, of course, leads the field in the Democratic primary to face Trump in next year’s general election. The investigation Trump wanted to see was meant to focus on Biden’s push in late 2015 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who’d earned the ire of U.S. and international officials for turning a blind eye to corruption. Trump and his allies claim without evidence that Biden advocated for the prosecutor’s firing because the prosecutor may have been investigating a company on whose board Hunter Biden sat.

Shortly after Trump put that pressure on the Ukrainian president, his administration halted military aid to Ukraine that had been approved by Congress, only proceeding with that aid after a whistleblower within the intelligence community filed a complaint apparently focused on Trump’s conversation with Ukraine’s president.

AD

AD

In short, then, Trump may have tried to leverage congressionally sanctioned aid to boost his own reelection chances — or, at least, he reportedly leveraged his position as president to push a foreign nation to aid his reelection campaign.

In short order, Trump’s allies — by now well experienced in waving away concerns about his presidency — moved into action. In a series of appearances on television and radio, they identified the real wrongdoing in the situation, blaming a diaspora of people and organizations in an effort to downplay or erase questions about Trump.

Joe Biden is the real wrongdoer

Biden has been the most common target of Trump’s defenders and of Trump himself.

AD

“They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal.” @PeterSchweizer The problem is, “Trump” did nothing wrong! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2019

The way those defenses are offered, though, varies.

On Sunday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” Pompeo, a stalwart defender of his boss, suggested that the situation was indeed not complicated: Biden did something wrong.

AD

“If there was election interference that took place by the vice president, I think the American people deserve to know,” Pompeo said, referring to Biden — and echoing the questions that have lingered around Trump’s 2016 victory since before his presidency began. “We know there was interference in the 2016 election and if it’s the case that there was something going on with the President or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that.”

Axios noted how Trump’s most fervent media defender, Fox News, positioned the story Sunday, compared with MSNBC. MSNBC noted how Trump was trying to shift questions onto Biden — and Fox embraced that precise shift.

It’s worth noting the particularly sloppy defense that Fox News chose to highlight. It was an interview with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. The suggestion Nunes made wasn’t only that Biden was culpable but, indeed, that he was already paying a political cost for being so deeply mired in this controversy.

AD

AD

“These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,” Nunes said. “So now that these have been resurrected, it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero.”

The allegation that Biden did something wrong in December 2015 didn’t originate with an effort by Hillary Clinton to keep Biden out of the race, given that he announced he wasn’t running that year in October 2015. What’s more, Nunes’s claim that Biden’s lead was “down to zero” was apparently based on a new poll in Iowa where Biden is running even with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

That poll was conducted before the Ukraine story emerged in the news.

AD

The problem with this theory? The central problem with the Biden-did-wrong theory is a dearth of evidence that Biden did anything wrong. While it’s easy to see how Biden’s demands about the Ukrainian prosecutor could be spun as an effort to aid his son, there has been no evidence to emerge that Hunter Biden’s role was the motivation for that firing, that Biden acted alone in making the demand, that he knew of an investigation or that an investigation into the company even existed. Instead of rewriting our Fact Checkers’ analysis of the situation, we’ll instead just point you to that article.

AD

And we’ll note that advocating for a prosecutor who is more likely to fight hard on corruption would seem like a weird choice.

Hunter Biden is the real wrongdoer

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin marched boldly into a minefield while talking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday.

AD

“What I do find inappropriate is the fact that Vice President Biden at the time’s son did very significant business dealings in Ukraine,” Mnuchin said of the controversy. “I, for one, find that to be concerning. And, to me, that is the issue perhaps that should be further investigated.”

“I don’t understand,” Tapper replied. “So it is okay for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Jr. to do business all over the world, it’s okay for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president, but while Vice President Joe Biden was vice president, his son shouldn’t have been able to do business dealings?”

AD

Mnuchin stumbled.

AD

“Again, I don’t — I don’t really want to go into more of these details,” he said, “other than to say …”

“Well, you’re just setting a precedent that the president is violating,” Tapper replied.

“Again, I think there is a significant difference in what you’re saying, okay, or what I was saying between Biden and his son’s relationship with the Ukraine oligarch,” Mnuchin said, “and potential business dealings that the Trump Organization has had which predated his presidency.”

That can be a subtle distinction. In August, for example, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to Indonesia to tout a resurrected resort there. It was in the works before Trump’s presidency, but at least one ethics group questions the extent to which it stretches Trump’s pledge that the Trump Organization would not to engage in new international deals during his presidency.

AD

AD

Trump Jr., meanwhile, expressed his own support for the idea that Hunter Biden had acted inappropriately, favoriting a tweet criticizing Hunter Biden’s having apparently profited from his father’s name.

The problem with this theory? While it’s certainly fair to question the appropriateness of a vice president’s child partnering with a foreign company, there is also some hypocrisy to those criticisms in this case. And, as above, there’s no evidence that Hunter Biden’s role prompted Biden’s demands.

Ukraine is the real wrongdoer

Trump and his allies have repeatedly pointed to Ukraine and Ukrainian politics to defend Trump since he took office. As questions arose about the 2016 Trump campaign’s interactions with Russian actors, Trump’s team tried to gin up a countervailing theory that Ukraine was working to boost Hillary Clinton.

AD

AD

In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggested that Ukraine’s role broadly should earn scrutiny.

“All things Trump have been looked at regarding Russia. Now it’s time for all things Ukraine to be looked at,” Graham said. “I like Joe Biden. I’ve been a friend of his for a very long time. But we can’t have two standards here. The prosecutor was looking at things in the Ukraine, and he got fired, and there’s all kind of allegations about the Ukraine dumping information into the legal system and political system in 2016 about Manafort and others, you know, Hunter Biden, what kind of situation did he have financially? I’m hoping somebody will take a look at all things Ukraine like they did with Russia from the Department of Justice.”

The problem with this theory? The theories about Ukraine trying to influence U.S. politics or the 2016 election have consistently been shown to lack merit.

AD

The theory that Ukraine was “dumping information” in 2016 centers on two incidents. In one, a contractor with the Democratic National Committee sought help from people at the Ukrainian Embassy in digging into then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s work in that country. In the other, evidence that Manafort had received secret payments from a pro-Russian political party was released by a Ukrainian organization in August 2016, leading to his ouster from the campaign.

In neither case is there evidence of a top-down effort on the part of Ukraine to aid Clinton. Both center on efforts to uncover information on Manafort, whose payments for his work for Ukraine led to convictions for money laundering and fraud. He is now in prison.

The whistleblower is the real wrongdoer

This story came to national attention after the Trump administration sought to prevent Congress from seeing the original complaint from a whistleblower inside the intelligence community. Mirroring months of attacks on the FBI agents who’d probed the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia, Trump allies cast the whistleblower as a “deep state” “spy” who had behaved dishonorably in bringing the story to light.

Gregg Jarrett: ""He appears to be an American spy spying on the president, listening in on conversations."" pic.twitter.com/nYOdLeHdna — Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) September 23, 2019

On Fox News last week, while acknowledging that he didn’t have broad context for what the whistleblower’s allegation was, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) declared that the situation looked like “another Deep State attack.” Speaking to Fox News’s Bret Baier on Friday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) insisted that all of the facts weren’t out, but that this appeared to be part of a pattern of someone “selectively put[ting] something out” to try to undermine the results of the 2016 election.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of Trump’s most energetic defenders, told reporters that there are “people in the intelligence community and other parts of the government who just have it out for the president.”

“I don’t have any worries about the president,” he added.

The problem with this theory? Even if the whistleblower were Hillary Clinton herself, it wouldn’t change the content of the conversation Trump had with Zelensky.

The media is the real wrongdoer

At an event in Texas over the weekend, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) identified his own culprit in the situation: reporters covering the story.

“I am a little troubled that apparently some of the initial reports came from somebody who didn’t have firsthand knowledge, and then it sort of took off like a wildfire,” Cornyn said of the story. “Lot of speculation. I’d prefer to wait until we get the access to the real information to make a judgment.”

Of course, the problem with that is that Congress was blocked from getting the whistleblower’s report in the first place. That’s what prompted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to subpoena the document.

Cornyn is not alone. In his interview with Hewitt, Graham suggested that the Ukraine story “makes the [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh story look like good journalism” — a reference to assertions from conservatives that the New York Times’s article about accusations against Kavanaugh was fatally flawed.

Trump shared a clip from Fox News in which Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) blames the media for the story, suggesting that it was simply part of the same complaints about Trump that have existed since he took office.

“It’s exactly the kind of thing they’ve been accusing Trump of all along,” Meadows said. “Can you imagine if the prosecutor in Ukraine, if his name was ‘Bob Mueller,’ what would have happened?”

It’s not clear what that means.

The problem with this theory? The simplest way to undermine the media’s reporting as incorrect or overly eager is to release the whistleblower complaint and the transcript of the Zelensky call so that the reporting can be contrasted with reality. So far, the administration hasn’t done so.

There was no wrongdoing at all!

This is the angle taken by Trump.

On Sunday, he claimed that the call with Zelensky was a “beautiful, warm, nice conversation” in which he didn’t pressure Zelensky at all. He later tweeted “breaking news” to that effect, spinning things back to Biden once again.

The problem with this theory? The American public is being asked to decide whom to believe, Trump or press reports. Trump’s assertion that nothing untoward happened depends, for now, on taking his word over that of the media and our sources."

On The Hill

THE POINT OF NO RETURN: Pressure is mounting on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open the formal impeachment inquiry she has so long resisted.

And then there were 146: On Monday night, seven House Democrats with national security and military backgrounds who won competitive House districts in 2018 came out to back launching an impeachment inquiry — bringing the total count of Democrats in favor of opening an inquiry to 146.

In an op-ed in The Post, freshman Democratic Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia write:

“If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of “inherent contempt” and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

They are referring to allegations Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of corruption by Joe Biden and his son. Trump did so while the United States was withholding promised aid from Ukraine.

House Dem just now: “the dam is breaking” on impeachment. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

More than a majority: Pelosi, who has said impeaching Trump is “just not worth it,” is now “sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach President Trump,” multiple Democratic officials told my colleagues Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis.

“Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has asked colleagues whether they believe that Trump’s own admission that he pressured a Ukrainian leader to investigate a political foe is a tipping point,” Rachael and Mike report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night to gauge support in the caucus, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable.”

From a Pelosi ally: Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a close Pelosi ally, also has changed her tune, writing in a statement that an impeachment inquiry “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable.

“Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she tweeted.

On today's docket: Pelosi has summoned House leaders to a 4 p.m. meeting to discuss the matter.

“Mindful that Democrats may have only a brief window to decide their course, [Pelosi] summoned the leaders of six House committees involved in investigations of the president to meet on Tuesday, telling the lawmakers to come without aides. Afterward, she planned to convene a special meeting of the Democratic caucus to discuss impeachment,” the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, Nick Fandos, Michael Crowley and Ken Vogel report. A full meeting of the Democratic caucus will take place afterward.

Rachael and Mike report that House leadership has discussed “the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence” to handle a hypothetical impeachment inquiry.

In the meantime though, Pelosi still faces some political obstacles:

“Voters still overwhelming disapprove of Democrats impeaching the president — though those polls where conducted before last week’s reports about the whistleblower complaint. In the Senate, Republicans have made it clear that they are standing with Trump and are unlikely to convict him if a trial occurs,” per Rachael and Mike.

But Trump seems impervious to the growing political firestorm — indeed, he appeared to be stoking it yesterday with incendiary comments targeting Biden at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York.

“What he’s learned is you can get away with just about anything if you’re willing to gamble and you have zero shame,” Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, told the New York Times's Peter Baker. “He had just outbluffed the old-school way of holding people to account, so what the heck, why not go for it in the phone call to the new, young and vulnerable Ukrainian president?”

“It’s difficult to imagine a purer example, even on the president’s own account of his conduct, of why the Constitution’s framers thought it essential to include the impeachment power,” Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told Baker.

At The White House

THE FACTS ARE COMING OUT: As the White House refuses to release the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky, reporters unearthed important details fueling suspicions Trump may have sought to leverage and withhold congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.

The latest: “President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials,” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig.

“Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had 'concerns' and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.”

Key: “Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an 'interagency process' but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11,” per Karoun, Josh, Ellen and Carol.

'A perfect phone call': That's how Trump has described the July phoner with Ukraine's president. But Zelensky spoke with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) during an early September visit to Ukraine and “'directly' expressed concerns at their meeting that 'the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence' of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens,” per our colleagues.

Trump took his attacks on Biden and the press to a whole new level:

“If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair right now,” Trump told reporters on Monday from a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.

The September Democratic presidential debate. (David J. Phillip/AP)

The Campaign

DNC RAISES DEBATE THRESHOLDS: “The Democratic National Committee announced new qualification rules for the November debates,” our colleague Michael Scherer writes of the decision “that could kick more candidates off the stage, as party leaders continue to push to shrink the field in the presidential nomination fight.”

The new rules: "" … candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from the October qualification levels. They will also have to meet a new polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the party, or by receiving at least 5 percent in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada,” Scherer reports.

Shades of McCain: ""Pete Buttigieg was inside his campaign bus, with reporters an arm's length away all looking directly at him, their notebooks, pens and recorders in hand,"" the Des Moines Register's Barbara Rodriguez reports. Bus tours across Iowa are quite common, but in a modern day twist on the late Sen. John McCain's ""Straight Talk Express,"" Buttigieg's team welcomed reporters to join him for the entirety of his four-day trip, everything on-the-record.

Some of the questions he's answered so far: ""What does he think about growing calls for an impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump?"" Rodriguez writes. ""Did he have a comment on the Republican Party's talking points about the presidential race? How does he assess the current psyche of American voters? What does he miss about home? How many of his signature white shirts and jeans had he packed for his four-day bus tour across Iowa? And was he ironing"" (4 shirts, he ironed himself; one pair of jeans).

In the Media

THIS BOMBSHELL STORY FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHER: A.G. Sulzberger, the Times publisher, spoke at Brown University about the state of journalism. He discussed for the first time a story that shows how much the Trump administration “has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press.” It is simply jaw-dropping.

You can read the full-text of his speech here.

What happened: “Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh,” Sulzberger said. “Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.”

Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.” But this time was different: “We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said.

The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said. Luckily, they figured out another way: “Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help,” Sulzberger said. “Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him. We hate to imagine what would have happened had that brave official not risked their career to alert us to the threat.”

TRUMP POPS INTO CLIMATE SUMMIT: The president unexpectedly dropped by the U.N climate summit in New York yesterday for 14 minutes. “He did not speak and left after listening to remarks from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Angela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor,” our colleagues Seung Min Kim and Anne Gearan report.

What Trump missed: “Leaders from France, Germany, India and other countries made public their commitment to increase renewable energy consumption and curb fossil fuel burning,” our colleagues write. He also missed an impassioned plea from teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.

THE BIG IDEA: Several House Democrats facing tough reelection fights next year in districts that Donald Trump carried in 2016 are expressing openness to impeachment for the first time, a major tipping point that reflects their palpable outrage over the president’s purported conduct toward Ukraine and will intensify pressure on their colleagues who hold safer seats to follow suit.

The latest is freshman Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. She picked up an open seat in the Detroit suburbs last fall that Republicans had held for decades. Trump won the district three years ago by 4.4 percentage points. In a statement sent after 7 a.m., Stevens said she did not get to this point lightly – “but rather out of a sober obligation to stand up for the rule of law and our national security.”

“Over the last several days, I have been deeply alarmed by reports of serious abuse of power by President Trump,” Stevens wrote. “The President is alleged to have used the power of his office to pressure a foreign head of state for his own personal political gain. Furthermore, the Director of National Intelligence continues to illegally withhold information about this matter from Congress. If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Stevens’s announcement follows a new Washington Post report that Trump ordered his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which the president is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden’s son. That’s according to three senior administration officials.

Trump confirmed this morning at the United Nations that he withheld military aid from Ukraine but insisted that he did so because he wanted other European countries to chip in. “But very importantly, Germany, France, other countries should put up money, and that’s been my complaint from the beginning,” the president told reporters at the United Nations.

We’ve been hearing lots of metaphors from plugged-in Democratic strategists we’ve spoken with over the past 24 hours like “the dam is breaking” and “the train is leaving the station.” Or, as Democratic pollster Geoff Garin put it, “The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up.”

Stevens is the third Michigan congresswoman to express support for moving toward an impeachment inquiry in a period of just 12 hours. As of 10 a.m., 148 House Democrats have now publicly expressed support for at least opening an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” (Follow our running whip count here.)

Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who represents a district that Trump carried by 6.7 points in 2016, which stretches from the northern Detroit suburbs to the state capital in Lansing, submitted an op-ed to The Washington Post last night with six other House freshmen who have extensive national security experience. They agreed that, if the allegations against Trump are true, “we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” And they’re calling on their colleagues to use all congressional authorities, including impeachment hearings, to “address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

Slotkin, who toppled Republican incumbent Mike Bishop in the midterms, is a former CIA officer who was personally involved in briefings for both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Fluent in Arabic, she was a Middle East analyst for the agency and deployed to Iraq for three tours over five years. Then she became the director for Iraq policy on the National Security Council, moved to the State Department and finally the Pentagon. (I profiled her in a 2017 Big Idea.)

The other signatories are Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. “We have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country, and throughout our careers, we have sworn oaths to defend the Constitution of the United States many times over. Now, we join as a unified group to uphold that oath as we enter uncharted waters and face unprecedented allegations against President Trump,” the seven wrote. (One of the members, Crow from the Denver suburbs, endorsed impeachment in July. But the others had all previously held off.)

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), the widow of the legendary John Dingell, has her finger on the pulse of the caucus better than all but a handful of her colleagues. She’s been exceedingly cautious on impeachment – arguing that it would “tear the country apart” – until last night. “This country is divided. We cannot be divided on the rule of law. As an elected official my oath is to protect national security and the Constitution,” she tweeted at 10:22 p.m. “After recent revelations, I support an impeachment inquiry because we must follow the facts and hold the President accountable.”

Because of Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from the other side of Michigan who left the GOP on July 4 after endorsing impeachment, Democrats can afford to lose 18 or so votes and still pass any article of impeachment. Republicans who control the Senate would then most likely acquit Trump during an ensuing trial in that body. Nancy Pelosi, though, wants something as close to unanimity in her caucus as possible and she’s been afraid to endanger her front-line members like Stevens.

Many prominent impeachment skeptics in the Democratic caucus have been friends and loyalists of the speaker who hold solidly blue seats but defer to her political judgment. That’s why it’s a huge deal that Pelosi loyalists have moved toward impeachment over the past 24 hours. The most prominent of these is Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.

In a lengthy statement last night, she said Trump’s “reckless abuse of power” is a “turning point.” She explained that her thinking changed and impeachment “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable. “Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she wrote.

Anyone who knows DeLauro knows she doesn’t put that statement out before checking with Pelosi. And another member from Connecticut who is close to Pelosi, Rep. John Larson of the Hartford area, piled on, as well. “The Director of National Intelligence must comply with the law on Thursday,” he tweeted. “If not, the Trump Administration has left Congress with no alternative but for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, which I will support.”

-- Thursday is shaping up to be a huge day on Capitol Hill. Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in open session on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee and in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Pelosi has given the administration until Thursday to turn over the whistleblower’s complaint, which set in motion this firestorm. Under federal law, any matter deemed of “urgent concern” by the inspector general – which this has been – is supposed to be shared with Congress. But the Trump administration is refusing to comply with that legal requirement.

Separately, three House Democratic chairmen threatened to subpoena documents pertaining to Ukraine that the administration has thus far declined to voluntarily hand over if they don’t get answers by Thursday. In a joint statement, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (N.Y.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (Md.) gave Mike Pompeo until then to let their panels know if he intends to comply with a request they sent to the State Department two weeks ago.

-- More on the internal power dynamics: “Pelosi has been quietly sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach,” Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. … [A]n official familiar with her thinking warned that just because she was considering impeachment didn’t mean it would happen right away. …

“Senior Democratic officials cautioned that no steps have been finalized, and there were still questions about timing and how to conduct the proceedings. Some Democrats, for example, want [Schiff] to have a role in whatever impeachment process moves ahead. Democratic leaders are also discussing the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence. …

“In the meantime, House leaders are planning to hold a vote on a resolution to either condemn Trump’s actions or express the sense of the House that the administration turn over the whistleblower complaint, a move liberals are already dismissing as insufficient. The language has not been finalized. … Impeachment dominated a meeting of chiefs of staff for lawmakers in competitive districts on Monday … [T]he session grew heated and angry, pitting those congressional aides who thought it was time to back impeachment against those who worry about the political fallout.”

-- Just as DeLauro and Larson came out in tandem, many other House Democrats have taken the impeachment plunge in pairs. I wrote in July about how both House members from New Hampshire endorsed an impeachment inquiry on the same afternoon. It happened again Monday in Minnesota. Two moderate Democrats from suburban districts in the Twin Cities, who both defeated Republican incumbents last year, issued strongly worded statements: Dean Phillips and Angie Craig.

-- Fresh details continue to trickle out about Trump’s role in freezing the money appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against a revanchist Russia: “Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July,” per Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig. “They explained that the president had ‘concerns’ and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent. Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an ‘interagency process’ but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11. … There was concern within the administration that if they did not spend the money, they would run afoul of the law … Trump on Monday repeated his denial of doing anything improper …

“Trump’s allies have frequently said he has been better about distributing military aid, and specifically lethal aid, to Ukraine than his predecessor. Yet according to Democratic and Republican aides, no administration has withheld funds as long and as mysteriously as the Trump administration did this year since the United States began helping Ukraine fend off Russian-backed separatists in the country’s eastern provinces. …Withholding aid from foreign governments is something the president has frequently requested, such as with Central American countries when he said they were not doing their part to help the United States with immigrants amassing at the southern border. …

“Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted to release the money to Ukraine because he thought it would help the country while curtailing Russian aggression. But Trump has said he was primarily concerned with corruption. … Besides Bolton, several other administration officials said they did not know why the aid was being canceled or why a meeting was not being scheduled.”

MORE ON THE L’AFFAIRE UKRAINE:

-- Senate Republicans mostly dodged and deflected questions about the whistleblower complaint. Felicia Sonmez, DeBonis and Erica Werner report: “So far only one Republican in the Senate, Mitt Romney of Utah, has voiced concern about the president’s alleged actions … As they returned to the Senate on Monday, most Republicans instead dodged questions about the whistleblower complaint or said that it is an issue for the Senate Intelligence Committee to address. Some, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), cast doubt on the allegations against Trump. … Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) disputed the use of the word ‘whistleblower’ to describe the person who revealed Trump’s phone call with (Volodymyr) Zelensky. … Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) mainly kept his focus on Biden, but he also suggested that Trump should release more details about his call with Zelensky. …

“Even Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), co-founder of the bipartisan Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, steered clear of addressing the allegations directly. In a statement, Grassley chided Democrats and the media for ‘rampant speculation’ but made no mention of Trump. … Later, in an exchange with reporters, Grassley declined to say whether he believes it is appropriate that Trump brought up Biden in his phone call with Zelensky.

“Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, said he believes Trump was wrong to have raised Biden in his call with Zelensky. But he dismissed calls for the president’s impeachment and said that so far no evidence has emerged of a quid pro quo offer by Trump of military aid in exchange for investigating Biden. ‘He simply raised the issue of Biden, and I don’t believe he should have done it,’ Rubio said. ‘But that in and of itself is not an impeachable offense, as some people claim. Now, the second thing you raise, [a quid pro quo], he denies, and so do the Ukrainians. If alternative information emerges, we have a different set of circumstances, but that’s not before us right now.’”

-- A counterpoint: “I think this is the most serious charge against the president, far more serious than what Bob Mueller dug or dragged up against him,” said Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano. “If you are the President of the United States and you are making a conversation that you know your intelligence community is listening to, of course you’re not going to articulate a quid pro quo. You’ll just make the quid pro quo happen.” (Daily Beast)

-- Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination next year, accused Trump of committing “treason” with his conduct toward Ukraine. “Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,” Weld said Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “It couldn’t be clearer, and that’s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It’s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty. … The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.” (John Wagner)

-- A taste of the commentary in today’s papers:

Peter Baker in the New York Times: When Trump was accused of collaborating with Russia to influence the 2016 election, he traveled the country chanting “No collusion!” This time, he is basically saying, so what if I did?

The Post’s Editorial Board: “In Ukraine, Trump’s allies are corrupt oligarchs and Russian stooges.”

Post columnist Eugene Robinson says Trump is basically begging for impeachment, so just give it to him already. “Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?”

Trump is basically begging for impeachment, so just give it to him already. “Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?” Conservative Jonah Goldberg writes in the Los Angeles Times: “The most noxious part of Ukraine-Biden whistleblower affair is Team Trump thinks we’re all idiots.”

-- In Trump’s attacks on Biden, Democrats see a worrisome reprise of 2016. Matt Viser and Isaac Stanley-Becker report: “Biden’s campaign released videos last weekend to supporters and memos to reporters attempting to debunk the unsubstantiated claims Trump is promoting about Biden, his son Hunter and Ukraine’s freshly minted celebrity president. … But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, the campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. The skirmish illustrated how ill-equipped Democrats, busy battling one another in the fight for the nomination, are to compete with Trump’s online megaphone, which includes not just his own Twitter feed and that of the Republican National Committee’s leadership, but also a regiment of conservative talking heads and highly active Internet trolls who have closed ranks around the president.”

-- To wit: Trump kept his focus on Biden at the U.N. on Monday. Sitting next to the Polish president, he claimed to reporters that, if Biden was a Republican, the media would have him in “the electric chair by right now.” Anne Gearan, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report: “‘The one who’s got the problem is Biden,’ Trump said. … At the United Nations, visiting diplomats were baffled by the sudden interjection of a complex Trump scandal that they found mystifying. ‘It puts foreign leaders in a difficult if not impossible position,’ said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ‘How do you manage this complicated person who doesn’t play the game by the rules, and how do you somehow protect this important relationship? Everybody’s a bit wary.’”

-- Bernie Sanders proposed a wealth tax plan that’s more ambitious than what Elizabeth Warren calls for. “Billionaires should not exist,” the democratic socialist from Vermont tweeted this morning. “Warren’s plan calls for levying a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million, as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion,” Sean Sullivan and Jeff Stein note. “Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million, and then increases that rate in a series of steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.”

-- The requirements to qualify for the November debate, announced by the Democratic National Committee, will imperil several more presidential campaigns. “Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro, and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer are among those who could fail to qualify for the November debates if they do not improve their polling in the coming weeks,"" Michael Scherer reports. ""Under the new November rules, candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from the October qualification levels. They will also have to meet a new polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the party, or by receiving at least 5 percent in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.”

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Office of the Special Counsel found that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing 737 Max pilots were “underqualified” and that the Federal Aviation Administration misled Congress about the issue. Michael Laris reports: “The findings of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel … have added to questions about the effectiveness and transparency of safety oversight at the FAA, which has come under scrutiny after two new 737 Max jets it had certified as safe crashed in Indonesia and Ethi­o­pia, killing 346 people. … Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner wrote that the ‘FAA’s official responses to Congress appear to have been misleading in their portrayal of FAA employee training and competency.’ … The FAA’s Office of Audit and Evaluation ‘determined’ that safety inspectors for the Max ‘had not met qualification standards. Specifically, these [inspectors] had not received formal classroom training as required by’ two FAA orders, Kerner wrote.”

-- Federal prosecutors in California are conducting a criminal probe of e-cigarette maker Juul, the Wall Street Journal reports: ""The investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office of the Northern District of California is in its early stages ... The Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration and several state attorneys general are investigating its marketing practices. … The San Francisco company has said it never marketed to teens and that its products are intended for adult cigarette smokers who want to switch.""

-- Playing hardball with money already approved by Congress, Trump's appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency are threatening to cut highway funding for California over its alleged “failure” to submit complete reports on its implementation of the Clean Air Act, the Sacramento Bee reports.

-- White House infighting, buoyed by a lack of presidential leadership, is thwarting action to address gun violence. From Politico: “On one side is Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, and Attorney General William Barr. Both are urging the president to back new firearms restrictions — including expanded background checks for gun sales — insisting he can be the leader who succeeds on an intractable issue that has bedeviled his predecessors and that he can win back moderate suburban voters in the process ... On the other side, a group that includes Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son and an avid hunter, and a top aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, is telling Trump he risks losing support from his conservative base if he pushes too aggressively on new gun control legislation ... Then there’s Trump, who has heard all of these arguments privately but publicly hasn’t committed to any plan.”

-- Rural public housing is falling apart under the Department of Agriculture’s watch, an NBC News investigation by Suzy Khimm found: “The residents of the Okeechobee Center in Belle Glade have mold creeping up their walls and ceilings riddled with holes. One mother reported roaches crawling over her infant’s face. Sewage was found leaking onto the ground outside the squat concrete buildings. These broken-down homes were built with money from U.S. taxpayers. The Okeechobee Center is part of the country’s biggest federal housing complex for farmworkers, and is supported by federal subsidies that help cover some poor families’ rent. Though the property is privately owned, it is supposed to be closely overseen by [USDA], which requires that the homes be ‘decent, safe and sanitary.’ But federal safeguards failed to prevent the property from descending into disrepair ... and now, as low-income housing like the Okeechobee Center is falling apart, the Trump administration wants to eliminate federal funding that could help fix it.”

-- The Trump administration will end the “catch and release” immigration policy that allowed immigrants claiming asylum to live in the United States while they waited for a court hearing, acting secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said. From NPR: “In a statement issued by DHS, the agency outlined how it intends to carry out its new policy starting next week. ‘If migrant family units do not claim fear of return, they will be quickly returned to their country of origin, in close collaboration with Central American countries,’ the statement read. ‘If they do claim fear, they will generally be returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).’ … McAleenan said the end of ‘catch and release’ is a reaction, in part, to the record number of 144,000 migrants apprehended or encountered at the southern border in May. He said that 72 percent were unaccompanied children or families.”

-- A team of USA Today reporters spent a week documenting the complex issues along the U.S.-Mexico border: “The week began with the death of a father and daughter. It will end with five more recorded deaths of migrants in the U.S. and untold deaths of others along the way. In that time, a young mother will become disillusioned by life in the U.S. and consider returning home. Federal authorities will release thousands of migrants, who will board buses and planes and scatter to cities across the United States. A shelter director will struggle to keep migrants in his care from being kidnapped or raped. A family in El Salvador will bury their loved ones. And still, each day, more migrants begin their journey north.”

-- A new project by the Guardian and the Marshall Project reveals how the United States built the world’s largest immigrant detention system. From “DETAINED”: “Immigrants, including asylum seekers and legal migrants, wait an average of more than four weeks to be released, though some have been held inside for years or even decades. Up to 2,500 are children and parents fleeing war and violence in their home countries. Thousands have alleged sexual and physical abuse inside the facilities. Forty years ago, this system did not exist. A modest system holding fewer than 3,000 migrants a day at the end of the 1970s, detention has now morphed into a sprawling machinery ensnaring immigrants across the country.”

-- Sen. Dan Sullivan (R), who is seeking reelection in Alaska, plans to once again vote to uphold Trump’s emergency declaration at the border, even though Sullivan's constituents will lose out on $102 million in construction projects as a result. He says he'll try to get Congress to reappropriate the money. “While I do not agree with the decision to defer any military construction in Alaska, it should be noted that the Democrats’ obstruction to fund much needed border security has forced the Trump administration to undertake these measures,"" Sullivan said in a statement to National Journal.

-- A Mexican congressman climbed the U.S. border fence to illustrate why he believes Trump’s wall is “totally absurd.” From ABC News: “Braulio Guerra, a congressman from the state of Queretaro, tweeted photos and a video of himself perched atop a 30-foot tall fence that separates the Mexican border city of Tijuana from the U.S. ‘I was able to scale it, climb it, and sit myself right here,’ Guerra said in the video. ‘It would be simple for me to jump into the United States, which shows that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall.’ He adds, ‘It's easy, and it shows how unnecessary this project, this political rhetoric from Donald Trump, is.’""

­-- The asylum agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador implies that any asylum seeker who is not from El Salvador could be sent back to that country and forced to seek asylum there, per the Intercept: “Although officials have said that the agreements would apply to people who passed through El Salvador or Guatemala en route, the text of the agreements does not explicitly make that clear. ‘This agreement is so potentially sweeping that it could be used to send an asylum-seeker who never transited El Salvador to El Salvador,’ said Eleanor Acer, senior director of refugee protection at the nonprofit organization Human Rights First. … Last week, the Salvadoran newspaper El Faro reported that the country’s agency that reviews asylum claims only has a single officer. Meanwhile, though homicide rates have gone down in recent months — since outsider president Nayib Bukele took office in June — September has already seen an increase in homicides.”

-- Chilling: An Army private at Fort Riley, Kan., has been arrested on charges of providing instructions on how to make bombs to people he met online, including an undercover FBI agent. Devlin Barrett reports: “Pfc. Jarrett William Smith, 24, was charged with distributing information related to explosives and weapons of mass destruction. In a criminal complaint, FBI officials said Smith provided bombmaking recipes in Facebook conversations. … The FBI was alerted to Smith’s alleged statements on Facebook and used a confidential informant as well as an undercover agent to engage in online discussions with him. Over time, FBI officials said, Smith offered bombmaking formulas to them both.

“Investigators found Smith had talked about joining a far-right Ukrainian paramilitary group in 2016 but ended up joining the U.S. Army a year later. In his group conversation, Smith wrote last month that he was looking for more ‘radicals’ like himself and talked about possibly killing far-left protesters known as ‘antifa,’ or possibly destroying cell towers or a local news station, authorities have alleged. That same month, he also talked about using a vehicle bomb to attack the headquarters of a major news network, according to the criminal complaint, although authorities did not identify the network in court papers. …

“After receiving a number of recipes, the undercover agent wrote to Smith: ‘Got a liberal texas mayor in my sights! Boom with that IED and that dude’s dead.’ FBI officials said Smith replied: ‘There ya go.’ The undercover agent asked, ‘You got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction, and death?’ Smith, according to the complaint, replied: ‘Outside of Beto? I don’t know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died.’ … FBI agents arrested Smith on Saturday, and officials say that after his arrest he made several incriminating statements acknowledging he had shared bombmaking recipes with others.”

-- Facebook removed an “I Love America” page run by Ukrainians and featuring patriotic themes, rippling flags and pro-Trump memes. Craig Timberg reports: “Facebook took action against the page — which had 1.1 million followers — and several affiliated ones after a report in Popular Information, a politically themed online newsletter, detailed the page’s Ukrainian management and remarkable reach. The report said ‘I Love America’ was founded in 2017 but had moved heavily into pro-Trump content and conservative memes in recent weeks, building a huge audience in the process. Data showed the ‘I Love America’ pages collectively generated tens of millions of ‘interactions,’ a metric capturing how many people like, share or comment on a post, on par with several of the largest American news sites. ‘I Love America’ also reposted memes from Russian sources, such as the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg troll farm that faces criminal charges stemming from its efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election.”

-- A West Palm Beach Marine Corps Reserve unit canceled its plans to celebrate the corps' 244th birthday at Mar-a-Lago due to bad optics, per the Palm Beach Post, even though no tax dollars would have been spent at the president’s club.

-- Abortion restrictions are costing states millions of dollars in taxpayer money, and it's going to reproductive rights groups they're trying to destroy. Dan Keating reports: “In the past four years, taxpayers in states trying to restrict abortion access have paid almost $10 million in attorney fees for abortion providers. That price tag is likely to keep growing as more abortion restrictions are challenged, including three in federal courts today. In an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade, these states are passing laws that severely limit or prohibit abortion, hoping that the courts will uphold them. But when, instead, those new laws are thrown out, the state has to pay the legal expenses for the abortion advocates. That puts taxpayers in the position of having to pay for the attorneys on both sides of abortion battles that often last for years.”

-- Daily 202 alumna Joanie Greve, now at the Guardian, reports from Topsham, Maine, on the continuing fallout for Susan Collins of her decisive vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh: “To some Maine voters – and especially Collins’ would-be Democratic opponents – the renewed focus on Kavanaugh has opened up a fresh opportunity to unseat Collins from her crucial Senate seat. … But Republicans are responding to Democratic enthusiasm by powering an even more impressive fundraising operation for Collins, who has not yet officially announced her intention to run for re-election. … Collins’ critics have been keen to point out how much of her money has come from outside Maine, arguing it represents her ideological drift away from the center of the political spectrum.”

-- The Florida police officer who arrested two 6-year-old children at their school was fired. Allyson Chiu reports: “Orlando Police Chief Orlando Rolón said Dennis Turner, who had been suspended after the incidents Thursday at a charter school, did not follow the department’s policy requiring approval from a supervisor for any arrest of a minor younger than 12. … The charges against the children have been dropped and state attorney Aramis D. Ayala said Monday that her office never intended to prosecute. …. Prosecutors said Monday that they intervened before either of the children were taken to a juvenile detention center. But the arrests have renewed scrutiny on policing in schools, which advocates and studies say often unfairly targets students of color and those with disabilities, landing the young people in handcuffs for routine misbehavior.”

-- John Gray, the Republican candidate for chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors in Virginia, deleted offensive tweets from his account, but his political opponent, Democrat Ann Wheeler, found them and shared them. Antonio Olivo reports: “Now, as Gray seeks the highest office in the rapidly diversifying county of 456,000 people, he finds himself doing exactly what he had hoped to avoid: Explaining why, in 2016, he tweeted the falsehood that Islam sanctions domestic abuse; why he wrote ‘a funny tweet’ that same year that said African Americans would stop ‘rioting’ and take a knee if someone played the national anthem; and why, in 2017, he called former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson ‘a moron’ for wishing Indians a happy Diwali. … In July, he posted a suggestion that Muslim hookah-bar owners should be forced to sell alcohol, even though doing so would be against their religion. Gray later said he regretted that tweet, which was intended as a reference to a legal battle involving a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple based on his religious beliefs.""

Anti-Brexit supporters celebrate today outside the Supreme Court in London after the court ruled it was illegal for the prime minister to suspend Parliament. (Frank Augstein/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Britain’s Supreme Court ruled today that Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally. William Booth and Karla Adam report from London: “Opponents of the U.K. leader argued that the five-week suspension, just ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, had the effect of preventing lawmakers from scrutinizing the executive. The case could have major implications for Brexit, as well as for the balance of power in Britain. … The ruling follows a three-day court hearing last week at the highest court, which was hastily convened to weigh contrasting judgments from English and Scottish courts on Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament until mid-October. … Johnson, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, told the Daily Telegraph on Monday that he would not resign if the court ruled against him, insisting that he was correct to suspend Parliament so the government could focus on its domestic agenda. ‘It is absolutely absurd to be totally fixated on Brexit,’ he said.”

-- Johnson is also under growing fire for his relationship with a young woman and alleged misuse of public money. From the Times: “In an article published this weekend, The Sunday Times of London reported that, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, his office directed tens of thousands of pounds in government money to a fledgling entrepreneur and close friend whose apartment he often visited during working hours. The entrepreneur, Jennifer Arcuri, an American and a former model, was 27 when she first crossed paths with Mr. Johnson in 2012. In the ensuing years, she was given coveted spots on trade missions with the mayor to Tel Aviv, New York, Singapore and Malaysia. … On a plane to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Johnson repeatedly refused to answer reporters’ questions about the article, including whether he was in a sexual relationship with Ms. Arcuri at the time.”

-- British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Johnson of an “alleged abuse of power,"" but he's facing down a rebellion in his own ranks. William Booth reports: Corbyn won “enough support from his party members to continue his strategy of strategic ambiguity on whether to leave the European Union. In chaotic show of hands in a packed hall at Labour’s annual conference, delegates rejected a motion calling for the party to immediately declare itself against Brexit, as many grass-roots activists had rallied for. Instead, the party will follow Corbyn’s cautious plan to try to win the next general election and only then decide — by a special party conference — whether it will campaign to remain in or leave the E.U. in a new referendum.”

-- In a must-read op-ed highlighting the growing threat to journalists across the world, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger reveals that a U.S. government official once alerted the newspaper that the Trump administration could be sitting on information regarding the potential arrest of a Times reporter based in Egypt: “The current administration … has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press. Seeing that, other countries are targeting journalists with a growing sense of impunity. … To give you a sense of what this retreat looks like on the ground, let me tell you a story I’ve never shared publicly before. Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials. But this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn.

“We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger. Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help. Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him.”

-- Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, had one question for the global leaders assembled at the United Nations: “How dare you?” Kayla Epstein and Juliet Eilperin report: “Thunberg chastised leaders for praising young activists like herself while failing to deliver on drastic actions needed to avert the worst effects of climate change, and she warned that if the world continued with business as usual, her generation would face an insurmountable catastrophe. … ‘I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,’ said Thunberg, who traveled for two weeks on a solar-powered sailboat to reach the United States this month. … She and 15 other young people filed a legal complaint with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child arguing that major countries — Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey — have known about the risks of climate change for decades but have failed to take sufficient action to curb their emissions. … ‘For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear,’ Thunberg added. ‘How dare you continue to look away and come here and say you’re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight?’”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin summoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival Benny Gantz to work out a deal that would weld their two parties into a unity government. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “ ‘We have taken a significant step forward tonight, and now the first challenge is to establish a channel of direct communication between the sides,’ Rivlin said in a statement after the meeting. The three had agreed not to reveal the nature of the conversation ‘at this time,’ the statement said. The discussions come as the country waits for Rivlin to kick off the next phase of Israel’s protracted political process: to announce which candidate he has chosen to make the first attempt at forming a governing coalition.”

-- U.S. and Afghan forces carried out a deadly raid on al-Qaeda in southern Afghanistan, destroying an apparent weapons cache. Susannah George reports: “Launched late Sunday, the operation was aimed at al-Qaeda targets in the Musa Qala district in Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province. A fierce firefight broke out as U.S. and Afghan ground forces surrounded a compound … The exchange of fire dragged into the early hours of Monday, and when the ground troops were unable to move into the compound, a U.S. airstrike was called in. The U.S. official said it was possible that civilians were inside the compound at the time of the strike. He added that allegations of civilian deaths are under investigation.”

-- The U.N. announced the creation of a Syrian constitutional committee to rewrite the country’s constitution. Sarah Daouch and Asser Khattab report: “In a statement, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said the ‘Syrian-owned and Syrian-led’ constitutional committee will be facilitated by the United Nations in Geneva, and he thanked Russia, Turkey and Iran for their diplomatic efforts. Russia and Iran are allied with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports the opposition in Syria’s civil war.”

-- A coalition of Latin American countries decided to impose sanctions on Nicolás Maduro’s cronies in an attempt to further isolate and oust the Venezuelan president. Carol Morello reports: “Egged on by the United States and the opposition government recognized by more than 50 democracies, the foreign ministers invoked a NATO-like treaty called the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, also known as the Rio Treaty. It is rooted in the principle that a threat to one member threatens all members. … No one was specifically named besides the reviled Maduro, but the diplomats said their vote means they will identify those deemed complicit with Maduro’s government, investigate and prosecute them, and ultimately seize their assets and sentence them to prison.”

AD

The deal was brokered by Jennifer McDonald, a longtime Front Royal resident who directed the Warren County economic development authority. Washington-area developer Truc “Curt” Tran pledged to finance it with $40 million from wealthy immigrant investors and a $140 million federal contract his technology company had secured. As an added bonus, Tran would fund a police training academy overseen by longtime Sheriff Daniel T. McEathron.

AD

But those were lies, documents in Warren County Circuit Court allege.

Tran never had the money to build the data center project on the 30 acres his company bought from McDonald’s agency for $1, a civil lawsuit alleges. And the training academy was one of several hoaxes that, prosecutors and civil lawsuits claim, allowed Tran, McDonald, McEathron and others to siphon away millions in public funds, which they allegedly used to buy properties, pay bills and gambling debts, and enrich relatives and friends.

Now McEathron is dead, Tran is being sued by the economic development authority and there are state and federal investigations underway. McDonald faces 28 state counts of embezzlement, money laundering and obtaining money through false pretenses. She has denied the allegations and did not return interview requests, while Tran declined to comment through his attorney.

The claims against them, industry groups say, reflect the perils of weak oversight in economic development agencies — quasi-public entities that oversee large, complicated transactions, and whose boards often lack the financial savvy and investor scrutiny that protect their corporate counterparts. In Montgomery County, Md., an economic development official pleaded guilty this year to embezzling $6.7 million. The head of economic development in St. Louis pleaded guilty to steering lucrative contracts to the county executive’s political donors. In New Jersey, a grand jury is investigating how $500 million in tax incentives went to firms that, in part, allegedly lied on their applications.

“The lessons here are that there’s a need for better financial accountability,” said Jeff Finkle, head of the nonprofit International Economic Development Council. “People beyond one person who is managing a project where the temptation may be too great.”

On Tuesday, the Virginia State Police announced that 14 current and former local officials — including all five county supervisors — were charged with misdemeanor misfeasance and nonfeasance “based on the individuals’ knowledge of and inaction [regarding] the EDA’s mismanagement of funds.”

AD

AD

The economic development authority is teetering on insolvency. And normally neighborly Front Royal once again feels toxic, as residents wonder where else the corruption may have taken root.

“The story is just getting more complicated,” said longtime resident Melanie Salins, who co-founded a community group that has tracked a growing web of suspicious land and business deals. “For them to be able to steal from us and look us in the face like everything’s fine, it’s offensive.”

A project with 'absolutely everything'

McDonald started as a property manager for the authority in 1999 after graduating from High Point University in North Carolina with a political science degree. She became director in 2008, eventually earning $115,000 a year.

AD

Chatty and self-assured, she excelled at navigating both complex land transactions and the clubby local political landscape. She presided over the powerful Rotary Club, cheekily wore a Dallas Cowboys jersey on football Sundays in a community of die-hard Washington Redskins fans and boasted (falsely, it turned out) about winning $102,000 at the slot machines in nearby Charles Town, W.Va.

AD

As director, she helped lure Walmart, Target and a Lowe’s home improvement store to Front Royal, as well as a $100 million hospital that is under construction, a former board member said. In 2014, she met Tran, who had sought help with the data center idea from the office of then-Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), according to Pete Larkin, who was Goodlatte ’s chief of staff.

A soft-spoken resident of upscale Great Falls, Va., whose website boasts of contracts with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Tran wanted to turn part of the former Avtex Fibers manufacturing campus into a hub for cloud computing, with a three-building, $40 million complex that according to its business plan would include a restaurant, a coffee shop and a music store.

AD

McDonald’s board approved a $10 million, 90-day loan. Tran promised funding from 80 foreign investors enrolled in the federal EB-5 visa program, which offers applicants and their families a path to citizenship in exchange for the jobs their money helps create. Officials and residents gushed over the plan.

AD

“This is our first step into a new era,” then-Mayor Timothy Darr said at a 2015 groundbreaking, as McDonald, Tran and Goodlatte smiled nearby.

The regional Criminal Justice Training Academy was announced the following year. McDonald said an anonymous donor would provide $8 million, and told her board the donor was Tran, the civil lawsuit says. McEathron, a fellow Rotarian, would be in charge.

AD

The broad-shouldered sheriff was a morning fixture at a vinyl-booth diner on Main Street. He had launched a summer camp and amused his deputies by playing faux saxophone as they lip synced to “Love Shack” by the B-52’s. The training academy further raised his profile.

“This is the first time we’ve ever done anything like this,” McDonald said, according to an account in the Northern Virginia Daily.

McEathron boasted: “We can offer absolutely everything at this facility.”

Starting to unravel

It all seemed in­cred­ibly fortunate. Until late 2016, when some town officials and residents looked up Tran’s company online.

AD

They found it hadn’t yet been allowed to solicit investments under the EB-5 program. The $140 million federal contract appeared to be a mirage, with Tran receiving no payments from it. Skeptics asked increasingly pointed questions at public meetings, sparking warnings from Town Council members that the naysayers would blow Front Royal’s big chance.

AD

“They chewed me up and down,” said Bébhinn Egger, a former council member who was among the first to raise alarms. “It only took me about 15 minutes of research to see that there was something fishy going on.”

In an email to McDonald in early 2017, Tran said the questions meant “our ability to raise capital within the EB-5 investor community is now in jeopardy,” court records filed as part of the civil lawsuit show. His company was eventually approved for the program, then later disqualified, a decision Tran is appealing, according to U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which administers the EB-5 program.

The Town Council authorized $1.7 million of infrastructure improvements for the Avtex site, and according to the lawsuit, McDonald allegedly paid Tran at least $1.5 million for construction costs without informing her board.

In 2018, Front Royal’s finance director discovered a bigger red flag: The authority had overbilled Front Royal nearly $300,000 for its portion of debt service related to the Avtex site and a road improvement project. At a meeting about the discrepancy, McDonald nonchalantly said she had mistakenly falsified some invoices, Town Attorney Doug Napier recalled.

AD

AD

“She was not at all contrite,” Napier said. “It just shocked me.”

The revelation prompted a call to state police and an independent review of the authority’s books that uncovered a dizzying array of phony invoices, phantom projects, secret land deals and bank wire transfers to entities controlled by McDonald or her friends, according to a copy of the review completed in May by the Cherry Bekaert accounting firm. The probe was commissioned by the authority and is the basis of the criminal and civil proceedings.

McDonald allegedly billed the authority more than $50,000 to pay for renovating a vacant inn, then used those funds to pay credit card bills, according to the review. She is accused of doctoring invoices to secure $4.6 million for purchasing tax credits, then embezzling that money.

A plumbing company owned by her husband, Sammy North, allegedly collected at least $66,200 in secret payments, the review found. North has also been arrested, as was Donald F. Poe, a family friend accused of conspiring with McDonald to funnel $841,409 to his solar panel installation company for work the board didn’t authorize.

AD

North did not return messages seeking comment. Ryan Huttar, an attorney for Poe’s company, said that his client performed the work it was hired to do and that it reimbursed the authority $335,000 when one job was canceled.

Attorneys in the civil lawsuit say McDonald allegedly convinced the authority to buy land from her aunt and uncle for a workforce housing project without disclosing that they were her relatives, and billed the authority an additional $130,000 in the transaction, most of which went to pay off what appeared to be her mortgage.

“You’d think somebody, somewhere along the line, would have an inkling that something was amiss earlier on,” said Napier, who filed a lawsuit on behalf of Front Royal seeking $15 million in damages from the authority and Warren County.

“This community is sort of like Mayberry,” Napier said. “We’re not used to criminality in government here.”

Allegations, arrests, tragedy

McEathron wasn’t charged. But he may have felt the tide turning against him.

He and McDonald had launched a real estate investment company called DaBoyz LLC in 2016, shortly after they announced the police academy. The firm used $3.5 million in authority funds to buy four properties, the independent review found. McDonald and McEathron also bought a three-bedroom home in Virginia Beach, which they rented to McEathron’s son and daughter-in-law, court records in the civil lawsuit show.

In one curious transaction, which lawyers for the authority say may have been an attempt to launder money, DaBoyz paid Rappawan, a construction company, $1.9 million for a large tract of land and then sold it back a month later for $1.3 million. Rappawan owner William T. Vaught Jr. declined to comment, citing the criminal investigations.

In March, the authority filed its own lawsuit, against McDonald, McEathron, Tran, their companies and two contractors. The following month, the FBI raided the authority’s offices, seizing documents in what signified the launch of a U.S. Justice Department investigation, according to local news reports at the time. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Western District of Virginia declined to discuss the probe, which Warren County officials confirmed was underway.

The sheriff was despondent over his tarnished image, his attorney said. He took early retirement in May. A few weeks later, he testified before a local grand jury, appearing at the county courthouse with his wife, a member of the county School Board.

Then, just before Memorial Day weekend, McDonald was arrested.

The following Tuesday, McEathron killed himself outside his family’s secluded mountainside home. Some of his deputies found his body. The gun was nearby.

“Either knowingly or unknowingly, he allowed himself to become involved in some of the things that apparently happened,” said Ron Llewellyn, a former county supervisor who was a friend of McEathron’s and served on the authority’s board when McDonald was director.

Llewellyn was among those indicted this week. He denies wrongdoing and said the allegations against the sheriff go against his memories of a man he saw as a pleasant, by-the-book law enforcement official.

But, he added, the evidence against McEathron is damning.

“I just can’t believe that he wasn’t aware of some of it,” Llewellyn said.

'Tip of the iceberg'

McDonald was charged this summer with additional counts of money laundering and grand larceny. Her husband was arrested on counts of money laundering and obtaining money by false pretenses. The local grand jury, which was initially set to finish its work this month, requested another six months to investigate.

While out of jail on $75,000 bond, McDonald lost a different court battle, with a judge in a defamation lawsuit ruling that she staged burglaries at her office and home in 2017 to try to deflect suspicions against her. The judge awarded County Supervisor Thomas H. Sayre (R-Shenandoah) $20,000 in damages for being implicated in those phony crimes.

Tuesday’s announcement included charges against Sayre, who denied wrongdoing through his attorney. Several others denied wrongdoing as well, or declined to comment.

Tran’s company has put a small, one-story office building on the Avtex site and is working to repay the $10 million loan from the authority. Tran was able to extend the term to 2045, officials said.

Because of one of the lawsuits, Tran is forbidden to sell the property, valued at $2.2 million. Court levies have also been placed on seven properties McDonald owns, plus six cars and $82,500 she has in the bank.

In hopes of regaining financial stability, the authority is trying to sell several of its properties, including a building on Main Street that Jeff and Ginny Leser leased in 2018 to open a general store. The couple hadn’t known about the brewing scandal. Or that the same building previously housed a store McDonald, her friend William Lambert and her former aide Michelle Henry allegedly used as a vehicle to steal more agency money.

Henry has been charged with embezzlement; Lambert with money laundering and obtaining money by false pretense. Lambert’s attorney, Phillip Griffin, said he has entered a plea of not guilty, adding that his client is “a minor player” in the scandal. Henry did not return phone messages; neither did Ryan Nuzzo , the attorney who represented her at her bond hearing.

The Lesers spent $9,000 to fix a bathroom the authority refused to repair. Last month, they closed their store, frustrated by sluggish sales, a warped ceiling and leaky roof, and the possibility that the building could be sold out from under them.

“I try not to feel like a failure,” Ginny Leser said in an interview. “But I do feel foolish.”

Local activists, who had called for the state and federal investigations to be expanded, rejoiced at Tuesday’s announcement.

“Somebody is finally listening,” said Salins, co-founder of the Warren County Coalition watchdog group. “It’s not every day that your entire government gets arrested. It’s so shameful.”

Residents had been pointing to emails between McDonald and other officials — some of which surfaced in the independent review, and some of which were printed out and dropped anonymously in mailboxes — that appear to demonstrate the government was aware of some suspicious transactions.

And they had been demanding answers from Supervisor Tony Carter (R-Happy Creek), another of the people charged in the recent indictments. Carter works for his mother’s insurance company, Stoneburner-Carter, which holds insurance policies on four properties owned by the authority and has collected about $46,000 in premiums since 2015, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

He didn’t return calls Tuesday, but said earlier that the insurance contract does not pose a conflict because he doesn’t own the company and, therefore, doesn’t directly benefit from the payments.

“If I did have ownership, that would have precluded me from writing those policies,” he said. “I did what was legally correct.”

Kristie Atwood, whose Facebook page One Mad Mother has become a repository of news about the investigations, called the latest indictments “just the tip of the iceberg.”"

For a minute there, it looked like Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 campaign would burst into flames five feet above its launchpad. The senator began her presidential bid by attempting to nullify one of her conspicuous liabilities — only to amplify that liability, amuse conservatives, and alienate indigenous groups. Within months, her finance director had quit, and her top left-wing rival had out fundraised her by an order of magnitude. Then, Joe Biden made his candidacy official, and promptly opened up a 30-point lead over the Massachusetts senator.

Nevertheless, she persisted. And with a little over four months before Iowa gets caucusing, Warren’s prospects have radically changed. As of this writing, betting markets now consider her by far the most likely candidate to win the Democratic nomination. For months now, each wave of new polling has shown her star steadily rising both nationally and in early primary states. And the latest batch of surveys is no exception.

A national Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday finds Warren’s support nationally climbing from 19 percent in August to 27 percent today — a large enough gain to put her ahead of Biden in that survey for the first time ever. Meanwhile, a new UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll of the California primary suggests Warren has gained 11 points in the Golden State since June, giving her a commanding lead over the rest of the field. Meanwhile, the most recent data from the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire comport with this general trend.

But the best news for Warren in these polls may lay beneath the headline data. Here are five quick takeaways from the last week of polling that bode well for Warren’s odds of facing Trump next November:

1) Biden is bending, and just might break.

If you only looked at the national polling averages, Uncle Joe would appear to be in very solid shape. RealClearPolitics’s poll of polls has Biden boasting 29 percent support, which is just a tiny shade beneath where he’s typically been over the past three months; in other words, the national data shows no steep or uniform decline in Biden’s standing.

But in the early voting states — where each campaign’s resources have been concentrated — the picture looks much dimmer for the former vice-president. At the start of July, Biden’s average support in Iowa was 26 percent; today, it’s just 20. Warren now leads the field in the Hawkeye State by nearly three points in RCP’s polling average. And surveys from New Hampshire tell a similar story: As of mid-July, Biden was leading Warren there by an average of 22 points; now, he leads by an average of three. And Monmouth University poll released this week has Warren ahead of him by two.

Meanwhile, the national landscape may be in the process of converging on Iowa and New Hampshire’s: In Quinnipiac’s newly released national poll, Biden’s support is 7 percent lower than it was in the same survey one month ago. Other pollsters have documented declines in the percentage of Biden supporters who are “enthusiastic” about their candidate. Finally, there are some non-empirical reasons to think the former vice president’s standing will continue to erode. Thus far, Biden has benefited from the perception that he would be a uniquely “electable” nominee. But the increasingly conspicuous decline in his verbal skills — combined with the fact that the Democrats’ newly launched impeachment push is sure to call attention to his son Hunter’s influence-peddling (and Trump’s ostensibly, wildly false allegation that Biden corruptly intervened to fire a Ukranian prosecutor who was looking into Hunter’s company) — could erode Biden’s claim to being the Democrats’ “safe” option.

2) Warren’s base of support appears to be diversifying.

For most of the campaign, one of Warren’s apparent weaknesses was her coalition’s demographic homogeneity: She commanded the adoration of college-educated whites, but piddling levels of support among most other parts of the Democratic coalition.

This fact lent itself to two competing interpretations:

1) Something about Warren’s persona or program made her a niche candidate, who was already near her ceiling of support (there being only so many white professionals in blue America) and would thus fade away.

or

2) College-educated whites were more likely than other Democrats to be paying close attention to the primary race. Thus, Warren’s poor showing with nonwhite, and non-college-educated voters merely reflected the fact that her name was not as widely recognized as Joe Biden’s or Bernie Sanders’s. And if this were the case, then her strong support among college-educated whites might actually be a leading indicator of her appeal to the broader Democratic coalition: Once other groups began tuning in to this year’s race, they too would see the same things that had made “Patagonia Democrats” swoon.

While there may be an element of truth to No. 1 (Warren does appear to be especially appealing to Democrats who share her skin tone and academic pedigree), recent polling data has made the second look increasingly plausible. Quinnipiac’s new national poll show’s Warren’s coalition diversifying in both racial and class terms. In fact, the Q-poll has Warren beating Biden among white voters without a college degree by a remarkable 37 to 20 percent margin.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

New Quinnipiac poll this morning shows Warren making inroads among black voters:



July:

Biden 53%

Warren 4%



August:

Biden 47%

Warren 8%



Now:

Biden 40%

Warren 19% — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) September 25, 2019

The Los Angeles Times poll of California tells a similar story. After performing poorly with non-college whites in the same poll back in June, Warren now claims 29 percent of the demographic’s vote, while Sanders and Biden respectively boast 20 and 18 percent. And although Biden still leads the field with 40 percent support among African-American voters, Warren now has 24 percent support among that key demographic in California, putting her in second with that constituency.

But there’s even more direct evidence that Warren’s real base isn’t college-educated white voters, so much as it is voters who are paying attention: In the progressive think-tank Data For Progress’s polling of the 2020 primary, Warren consistently performs best among voters express a high level of interest in the news — including non-college-educated and non-white news junkies.

3) Harris 2020 (almost certainly) isn’t happening.

For a brief period in early July, Kamala Harris led both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in national polls. The California senator also boasted considerable support among professional Democrats and liberal donors. Many observers expected her to emerge as Biden’s main rival. But she’s proven to be the 2020 version of Scott Walker — a candidate with strong Establishment support who makes a lot of sense on paper, but never made much headway with actual voters. Quinnipiac now pegs Harris’s support at a mere 3 percent; her average in national polls is 5 percent. Critically, her numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are almost identical to her national figures. Unless she orchestrates an improbable comeback in one of those early states, Harris could be forced to euthanize her campaign by early March, leaving Warren the only viable option for Democrats who wish to elect a female president.

4) Warren is acceptable to a broader range of Democratic voters than any of her rivals.

Both the Quinnipiac national poll, and Los Angeles Times California survey, show Warren with a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than Biden or Sanders. And the Times finds that nearly 70 percent of California Democrats rank Warren as their first or second choice. Those results are consistent with a Data For Progress/Civiqs national poll released earlier this month, which showed Warren as the most popular second choice among Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris voters. And several other surveys have produced similar findings. This obviously bodes well for Warren if and when the Democratic field narrows, and suggests that a contested convention, she may have a strong claim to being a “unity” figure.

5) Sanders is stagnating.

Bernie Sanders’s campaign is very much alive. The Vermont senator’s has amassed enviable donor and volunteer networks, and has led in multiple recent polls of early primary states. Still, Sanders’s support has been stagnant nationally for months now, while his average share of the vote in Iowa has fallen from 19 percent in July to 12 percent today. Given that the senator is already well-known among Democratic primary voters, it is not clear how much room he has to grow. Sanders has made no secret of the fact that he favors Warren over his other primary rivals. So, it is at least possible to imagine a scenario in which Sanders’s campaign runs out of steam by next April, and then throws its considerable resources behind Warren.

Of course, Warren’s nomination remains far from a sure thing. Biden’s numbers are still formidable. Sanders is still within striking distance. And it’s still early. But at this point, there’s a strong case that Warren is the candidate you’d want to be."

The early state polling drought in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest really does seem to be ending. After this weekend’s gold-standard Selzer poll from Iowa, today we received results from high-quality polls in New Hampshire (Monmouth) and Nevada (USA Today/Suffolk).

The most immediate news in this mini-harvest of public opinion is that the Monmouth poll qualified a 12th candidate for the October Democratic debates in Ohio by taking 2 percent, Tulsi Gabbard now has met the four-poll 2 percent threshold. This development all but eliminates any doubts that this round of debates will again be a two-day affair, after the brief bliss of ten candidates fitting on the same stage in Houston earlier this month.

The same poll, though, continues a string of bad results for Bernie Sanders in terms of his standing in early states vis-à-vis his progressive rival Elizabeth Warren. Monmouth has Warren now edging Joe Biden in the Granite State by a 27-25 margin — but with Sanders down to 12 percent, just ahead of Pete Buttigieg with 10 percent. This is extremely similar to what Selzer found in Iowa (Warren 22 percent, Biden 20 percent, Sanders 11 percent, Buttigieg 9 percent). That makes any suspicion (based on an national poll in August showing Warren in a three-way tie with Biden and Sanders) that Monmouth is somehow putting a thumb on the scales for Warren a non-starter. The USA Today/Suffolk poll of Nevada shows Biden still in the lead with 23 percent, but Sanders at 14 percent is trailing Warren’s 19 percent by a significant margin. Indeed, as Nate Silver pointed out (a bit too avidly, you might say, but accurately), poor early state poll numbers for Sanders are becoming too routine for comfort:

This is a list Bernie Sanders' standing in all early- state polls since the Houston debate



IA: 9% (David Binder Research)

IA: 11% (Selzer)

NH: 12% (Monmouth)

NV: 14% (Suffolk)

IA: 16% (Civiqs) — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 24, 2019

As a reminder, Sanders won nearly half the vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2016, along with 60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.

Like his fellow late-septuagenarian Joe Biden, Sanders is doing quite a bit better in national polls. The latest RealClearPolitics averages have Biden at 30 percent, Warren at 20 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent, with Buttigieg way back at 6 percent. But the trends aren’t great for Bernie. For months one of his bulwarks was the vast Morning Consult tracking poll. He’s now fallen behind Warren there, too.

Aside from the good news for Gabbard concerning the October debates, we are now in the window when selected polls will count toward qualification for the November debate, too. With today’s releases, there are now two national qualifying polls and three from the early states, with the threshold now up to a three percent showing in four national and/or early state polls, or 5 percent from two early state polls. The Big Three plus Buttigieg and Harris are hitting these thresholds routinely, but among the iffier candidates, it’s notable that Booker and Yang now have two qualifying polls, while Klobuchar, O’Rourke, and Steyer have just one (September debate participant Julian Castro has been skunked so far, as has Gabbard, whose qualifying number from Monmouth for October fell short of the November threshold).

We’re probably looking at a single night of debates in November, but the thing to watch is whether the current Big Three of Biden, Warren, and Sanders is looking more like a Big Two with Bernie slipping back and perhaps some other candidate coming on."

In the remarkable events of the last few days that have suddenly brought House Democrats together in determination to impeach the president, a name keeps coming up nearly as often as that of Trump. It’s “Biden,” as in presidential candidate Joe and his globetrotting son, Hunter.

Yes, the case for impeaching the 45th president is broad and deep. But for the moment, impeachment fever and the MAGA counter-fever it will inspire are dwelling on the story of Trump’s efforts to sink Biden by securing an investigation of Hunter by a foreign government. Trump failed to get the Ukrainian government to lower the boom on Hunter Biden. But his ultimate objective, ironically, could be nearly as well served by controversy over his likely illegal actions, which will keep the “Biden corruption” story in the news. It’s kind of a like a hurricane stalled on the coast, pounding unlucky residents who are suddenly the primary object of nature’s wrath.

No one, so far, has made a credible case that Joe Biden did anything directly to help his son in his career as a lawyer-lobbyist, a procurer of appropriations earmarks, and an international man of mystery — much less anything inappropriate. But clearly, Hunter benefited from his last name, and aside from questions about his business dealings in Ukraine and China, his personal problems will be catnip for hostile and even friendly media alike. Hunter Biden’s history of substance abuse, the allegations made against him by his ex-wife during an ugly divorce, and his relationship with the widow of his brother, Beau, have all been out there in the public record. But they will get fresh exposure so long as he is a figure, however peripheral, in the impeachment case against the man his father is trying to defeat. Obviously enough, Team Trump wants it to stay that way, which is precisely why Trump and his goon, Rudy Giuliani, were trying to drop a dime on Hunter Biden and smear Joe in the bargain.

Should Team Biden be worried about this problem, absent any real evidence of wrongdoing? It’s hard to say. His presidential candidacy has overcome more immediate blows, mostly concerning his friendliness toward bigots, his long Senate record with its questionable policy positions, and his tendency now and then to sound like an old man who has lost a few steps. His perceived “electability” is a powerful asset. And it won’t be that easy over time for Trump fans to hammer away at Biden for his son’s alleged missteps given the president’s own sketchy relationship with sketchy family members (not that fear of looking hypocritical is a major inhibition for most of them).

The main reason Hurricane Hunter could be a problem for Biden is the timing. The 2020 Democratic nomination contest is at a delicate point, with Biden very slowly but steadily losing ground as Elizabeth Warren’s candidacy takes off like a rocket. As recently as August 7, Biden had a 15-point national lead over then-second-place Bernie Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling averages. Now he has a lead half that size over Warren. More alarmingly, Warren now leads Biden in the polling averages for Iowa, and has nearly caught him in New Hampshire (where the most recent high-quality poll, from Monmouth, gave Warren an actual lead). If Biden loses in both these initial states, history says his candidacy should fail (Bill Clinton didn’t win in Iowa or New Hampshire either in 1992, but that’s partially because he did not contest the former state, locked down by favorite son Tom Harkin). There’s even trouble down the road in California (which is voting just a few days after South Carolina), where a new Berkeley IGS poll shows Warren leading Biden by nine points.

In this period when voting intentions are beginning to form, it’s not a good thing for Joe Biden that his last name is hourly in the news in connection with a corruption claim associated with the biggest story in politics: impeachment. Perhaps Democratic voters will actually gain sympathy for the former veep as the victim of a notorious Trump smear. But voters obsessed with electability could see this as a preview of Trump’s signature ability to drag his opponents right down into the moral morass that is his natural habitat.

Her idea was ambitious and controversial, but Sanders’s idea goes much, much farther.

AD

AD

Warren’s plan is relatively straightforward: Tax all assets above $50 million at 2 percent per year and all assets above $1 billion at 3 percent per year. Sanders’s plan not only kicks in earlier, it includes more gradations that tax the mega-rich much more heavily. Here’s how it would work:

1 percent tax on wealth over $32 million

2 percent tax on wealth from $50 million to $250 million

3 percent tax on wealth from $250 million to $500 million

4 percent tax on wealth from $500 million to $1 billion

5 percent tax on wealth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion

6 percent tax on wealth from $2.5 billion to $5 billion

7 percent tax on wealth from $5 billion to $10 billion

8 percent tax on wealth above $10 billion

If you’re one of the 600 or so billionaires in the country, this tax would hit you much harder than Warren’s would; on that 11th billion, you’d have to pay $30 million under Warren’s plan but $80 million under Sanders’s plan. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, Sanders’s tax would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, significantly more than Warren’s version.

For Sanders, the goal isn’t just to get the overclass to pay their fair share; he wants to cut them down to size. “Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years,” the plan says, “which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class.”

AD

AD

While the right might despise wealth taxes for ideological reasons, some liberals dislike them for practical reasons. In Europe, a dozen countries had wealth taxes a few decades ago, but now that number has been reduced to three: Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Countries decided that the rich found it too easy to avoid the tax, in many cases just moving out of the country, and they wound up raising less revenue than the governments had hoped.

Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal economist and a wealth tax skeptic, predicted to me that if a tax of this sort was in the offing, you’d see billionaires renounce their citizenship before it took effect or find other creative ways to avoid the tax.

“If Warren and Sanders really want to crack down on inequality, they should address the market structures that generate inequality, such as patent and copyright monopolies, a bloated financial industry and a corrupt corporate governance structure,” Baker said. “Both have good proposals on these issues, but a wealth tax is likely to be economically wasteful and a political embarrassment.”

AD

AD

Other economists disagree, however. Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities offered me this qualified endorsement:

Given the extent of wealth concentration and the tax sheltering that protects it, it’s clear to me and most other progressives that the time has come to make a serious run at taxing wealth. I like the simplicity of Warren’s approach relative to Bernie’s, but given that any such tax is and will be a tremendous political reach from where we stand today, the important thing is to get these ideas bouncing around the echo chamber.

Both Sanders and Warren answer the criticism about the super-rich avoiding the tax by saying they’ll make sure the tax is free of loopholes and beef up the IRS budget for enforcement.

In fact, revitalizing the IRS should be a priority for any Democrat, whether they pass a wealth tax or not, since Republicans have spent decades eviscerating the agency, with the result that it’s incapable of forcing the ultrawealthy to pay what they owe right now.

On the politics: Getting either plan through Congress would be a long shot at best, but if nothing else, this discussion can expand the debate around taxes. Sanders would probably argue that fundamental change starts with getting people to consider ideas that some find radical.

AD

AD

At a time of grotesque inequality, wouldn’t it be good for Democrats to debate how much we should be making plutocrats contribute? Republicans will inevitably argue that billionaires should not have to be burdened by contributing to the country that enabled them to accumulate their vast holdings in the first place, a stance that won’t do them any favors with the voting public.

As enthusiastically as some Fox personalities will make that case (they’re already doing it), I say it’s the last thing President Trump would like to talk about. That’s especially true if Sanders or Warren becomes the nominee, since they’d run campaigns centered on the idea that wealthy people have rigged the system in their favor. Trump’s faux-populism only works if there isn’t a more genuine kind voters can compare and contrast.

But this proposal is one more signal from Sanders that he’s going to go farther in what he proposes than any other Democrat. It might not help him win the nomination, but it will certainly enable him to keep influencing the policy debate.

The dam is bursting, the floodgates are opening, the horse is out of the barn. Choose whichever metaphor you want — the point is that news of President Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden has supercharged Democratic support for impeachment proceedings — to the point that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday afternoon.

What stands out about the latest crop of converts to the cause is how many are from swing congressional districts — the kinds of places where bringing charges against the president may be a far riskier political gamble than in safe Democratic areas, given that impeachment has consistently lacked majority support in national polls. The lack of enthusiasm from representatives in these districts is one reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been so unenthusiastic about triggering the procedure over Donald Trump’s alleged obstruction in the Russia investigation.

But the Ukraine story seems to be different. Here’s a running list of lawmakers joining the impeachment push.

House Democrats Newly in Favor of Impeachment

At least 20 House Democrats have expressed support for impeachment for the first time in just the past two days, bringing the total number of representatives on board to 174 Democrats out of 235, according to Politico’s running counter.

On Monday, Congresswoman Angie Craig, who represents a Minnesota district Trump carried by a point, said she is onboard with impeachment.

Later that night, seven freshman Democrats wrote a Washington Post op-ed in which they deemed Trump’s actions a possible threat to national security. Four of them — Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria, Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin, and New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill — represent districts Trump carried in 2016.

Here's how Trump did in the Impeachment 7 op-ed writers' districts in 2016:



Spanberger VA-7 Trump +7

Slotkin MI-8 Trump +7

Luria VA-2 Trump +4

Sherrill NJ-11 Trump +1

Cisneros CA-39 Clinton +9

Crow CO-6 Clinton +9

Houlahan PA-6 Clinton +10



AVG: Clinton +1 — Domenico Montanaro (@DomenicoNPR) September 24, 2019

On Tuesday morning, New York’s Antonio Delgado joined the impeachment bandwagon. Delgado defeated incumbent Republican John Faso in an upstate district that voted for Trump by more than six points.

Some lawmakers appeared to be shifting on impeachment, but didn’t endorse it outright — yet. Texas’s Colin Allred said if the Trump administration doesn’t turn over the full report of the whistle-blower who alerted the government to Trump’s alleged misconduct, he would support impeachment. In 2018, Allred defeated a longtime Republican incumbent in a district that had voted for Hillary Clinton by just two points.

Later, Texas representative Lizzie Fletcher announced her support as well. Fletcher’s district narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016 but hadn’t been represented by a Democrat in Congress since 1967.

The facts we have learned recently are matters of utmost importance for our national security, country, and Constitution. The House should act swiftly to investigate and should be prepared to use the remedy exclusively in its power: impeachment.



See my full statement here: pic.twitter.com/xho0DlD107 — Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (@RepFletcher) September 24, 2019

Two representatives from Nevada, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, followed suit.

Lee’s district narrowly voted for Trump in 2016.

Haley Stevens of Michigan, who won a district that Trump carried by five points, wrote that “if investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offenses that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Also on Tuesday, civil-rights icon John Lewis announced his support for impeachment from the House floor.

Other Democrats who joined the herd include New York’s Joe Morelle and Michigan’s Debbie Dingell, Tennessee’s Jim Cooper, and Florida’s Donna Shalala and Lois Frankel, Pennsylvania’s Susan Wild, and Iowa’s Cindy Axne.

As a rough measure of swing-district support, just five Democrats who represent districts Trump won in 2016 had endorsed impeachment before this week, according to Politico; now that number is up to 13 and is likely to rise.

These lawmakers’ decisions were apparently not triggered by House leadership in any way, making them all the more significant.

While most of the action was in the House on Tuesday, the Democrats’ second-in-command in the Senate, Dick Durbin, joined in as well.

Non-Democrats in Favor of Impeachment

So far, only one non-Democrat in Congress supports impeachment: Michigan representative Justin Amash, who switched his party registration from Republican to Independent earlier this year after declaring that Trump should be investigated. On Tuesday, he reiterated his call to action in an effort to nudge his erstwhile Republican colleagues.

Just do what is right. Stop waiting for others to act first. Take responsibility for yourself and set an example. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 24, 2019

There is no sign that any House Republicans will join Amash.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has appeared surprisingly eager to cooperate with Democrats, at least on the narrow matter of getting to the bottom of what the whistleblower actually said.

One Republican, Mitt Romney, has expressed serious consternation over Trump’s behavior.

When asked about impeachment on Tuesday — hours after Trump had mocked him on Twitter — Romney didn’t rule it out.

Some other Republicans, like Marco Rubio, have downplayed the allegations against Trump.

Democratic Presidential Candidates in Favor of Impeachment

Of the major presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, and Tom Steyer have previously called on Congress to impeach Trump. Pete Buttigieg has said Trump “deserves impeachment” but has stopped short of endorsing it. Bernie Sanders had also avoided a full-throated endorsement until Tuesday:

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.



Enough is enough.



I hope the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House will begin the impeachment process. pic.twitter.com/WHth62v5br — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Joe Biden, who is at the center of the Ukraine scandal, has so far resisted calls to impeach. But on Tuesday, he said that if the Trump administration does not cooperate with Democrats’ demands for full access to the whistle-blower’s complaint, he’s on board.

Joe Biden: If Pres. Trump doesn't give Congress documents on Ukraine, Trump will leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy ""of his own making.”



""We know who Donald Trump is. It is time to let the world know who we are."" — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 24, 2019

Other candidates are reaffirming their belief that Trump should face charges.

The House must impeach. It must start today. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 24, 2019

Enough. It’s time to impeach. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 24, 2019

Warren’s plan calls for levying a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million, as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion. The relatively high threshold has helped Warren fend off critiques that large farms could be exposed to the tax.

AD

AD

Sanders would hit more people with the tax and would also significantly increase how much it would take from the very wealthiest, following a pattern in which he has sought to stake out the leftward boundary of the Democratic Party when it comes to policy proposals.

Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.

The announcement Tuesday highlighted the country’s striking divide over economic policy. Two of the three top-polling candidates for the Democratic nomination are now advocating a sweeping change in the way wealth is allocated in the United States, embracing policies that have not been so prominently discussed since the 1960s.

AD

Under President Trump, meanwhile, the Republicans have passed a far-reaching tax cut plan that economists say will dramatically expand the deficit. This comes less than a decade after the tea party angrily seized the nation’s attention, and a measure of power within the GOP, with a low-spending, anti-deficit message.

AD

On Tuesday, Sanders concluded a two-day swing through Iowa counties that Barack Obama won and then went for Trump. He’s dubbed the trip his “Bernie Beats Trump” tour, presenting himself as the most electable Democratic candidate against the president.

But Sanders has struggled to recapture the magic of his near-win in this first caucus state in 2016. A recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren leading with 22 percent. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, and Sanders was running third at 11 percent.

AD

Sanders and Warren have been battling for supremacy in the Democratic Party’s liberal wing, issuing dueling proposals on a number of topics that would reshape the nation’s safety net and significantly expand the role of government.

Their proposals include making public colleges and universities tuition-free, wiping away much or all of the student loan debt in the country, and enacting a Medicare-for-all health-care system.

AD

The plans are estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars, raising questions about how they would be paid for. Warren for months has pointed to her wealth tax, and Sanders’s new proposal gives him a similar revenue source to cite.

AD

Sanders aides noted that the senator has spoken of a wealth tax for decades, including proposing it as a possible funding source for his Medicare-for-all plan. In 1997, Sanders wrote that it was “time, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.”

However, there is no guarantee that Warren or Sanders, if elected, could push such a far-reaching new tax through Congress.

When it comes to wealth taxes, the impact on the nation’s biggest fortunes would be profound. Bill Gates, estimated to have $107 billion in wealth, would under Sanders’s plan pay at least an additional $8 billion annually to the federal government. Sanders’s campaign says the wealth of billionaires overall would be halved under his proposal.

AD

AD

The plan to tax the wealthy could pay for some of Sanders’s plans but fall short of covering other parts of his agenda. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California at Berkeley estimate Sanders’s plan would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, although conservatives have said such estimates overstate how much can be raised through a wealth tax.

Sanders has unveiled a $2.5 trillion plan to end homelessness and create 10 million new housing units and a $1.7 trillion plan to cancel all student debt in the United States; those two initiatives alone would come close to equaling the money raised by the wealth tax. The campaign said the tax would be used to fund the housing plan, pay for universal child care and help finance Medicare-for-all.

The senator has proposed a $30 trillion Medicare-for-all health-care system that would eliminate families’ health-care spending, which Sanders has said would be paid for with higher middle-class taxes, as well as ­taxes on the wealthy.

AD

AD

The biggest difference with Warren’s plan is that Sanders’s would more directly target the fortunes of billionaires and multi­billionaires.

Zucman noted on Twitter that Sanders’s plan “would make it much harder to remain a multibillionaire durably.” But he said that if Sanders’s tax had been enacted in the 1980s, billionaires’ share of the national wealth would still have increased.

That means Sanders’s plan would stop short of a “maximum income” plan favored by some on the left, although Sanders has come out in favor of that as a long-term goal, telling the New York Times, “I don’t think that billionaires should exist.”

That position follows months of debates in left-leaning circles over whether Democrats should push taxes high enough to eliminate all billion-dollar fortunes, an idea championed, for example, by an aide to first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

The revelation reflects the extraordinary tensions between the White House and the nation’s highest-ranking intelligence official over a matter that has triggered impeachment proceedings against President Trump.

The officials said that Joseph Maguire, who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday.

The move was in part designed to force the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it was going to assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July."

Warren’s campaign declined to specify the spending breakdown between digital and television ads, but said the focus would be on digital first, with airtime reserved for television ads over the next few months. The ads focus on a familiar theme from Warren’s core message: that she’s not afraid to take on government corruption.

“It will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns,” campaign manager Roger Lau said in the Tuesday email.

The foray into television advertising marks a shift for Warren, who eschewed TV ads in her 2018 reelection bid for the Senate. It reflects the challenge of running a nationwide presidential campaign, rather than focusing on a single state where the candidate is already well-known.

The announcement comes as Warren is moving toward the top of polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, though the race remains fluid. But her campaign is also seeking to show it’s building strength in states that are not in the first wave of primaries and caucuses.

State directors and organizers will be hired in places like Minnesota, Texas and Florida, the memo said, adding that the moves were designed in part to help Democrats win downballot races.

“We’re putting boots on the ground in places like Michigan and Minnesota, which will help flip state legislatures to Democratic control,” Lau wrote. “And we’re continuing to build the future of our party by investing in states like Texas and Florida.”

Warren has recently gained momentum in the packed Democratic primary field. Last week, she addressed her largest crowd yet — about 20,000 in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park — in a speech that hailed the political power of female-led organizing.

Last week, a poll from the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom showed Warren about even with former vice president Joe Biden in Iowa, while a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday showed she had made significant gains in New Hampshire since May.

Wall Street is sounding the alarm over Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s rise in the Democratic presidential race, as investors start to grapple with the possibility the industry scourge secures her party's nomination.

One investor joked that the stock market wouldn't even open if the Massachusetts senator became president; a segment on CNBC featured the idea that married couples could get divorced rather than be subjected to Warren's ""wealth tax.""

For now, the rising nerves are mostly evident in chatter. There's an emerging consensus that a Warren presidency would hurt the stock market -- yet there’s little evidence that investors are pricing in the risk.

""From a pure markets perspective, a Warren nomination hardly seemed 'priced in,'"" Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group writes. He offers a few theories why that's the case: The election remains far away; Warren could be seen as a weaker Trump foe; or that Warren will moderate her pitch if she secures the nomination. ""In any event, buckle up.""

Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for AGF Investments, dismissed the possibility of market fallout from the firestorm in Washington over reports Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — and the renewed impeachment talk it has touched off.

“What could affect the markets, however, is what we have warned about for months: the growing possibility that [Warren] may be the Democrats’ nominee,” Valliere writes.

Hedge fund titan Leon Cooperman went further. “They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,” he said to the crowd at the Delivering Alpha Conference, apparently joking.

He later clarified the comment in a CNBC interview, saying the market would open, just “a hell of a lot lower,” estimating a 25 percent selloff and a bear market lasting at least a year. (Institutional investors, according to an RBC survey, view the Massachusetts Democrat as the candidate most threatening to the stock market, beating out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 51 percent to 38 percent.)

The network just aired a piece suggesting married couples rich enough to face Warren’s wealth tax, which proposes a 2 percent levy on a household's assets greater than $50 million, could avoid it by getting divorced. Richer couples stand to save even more by splitting, since the tax would apply an extra percent to assets over $1 billion. “If a couple worth $2 billion divorces, they would save $10 million a year in taxes,” CNBC’s Robert Frank explained.

Couples could continue living together, the piece suggested, and just legally end their marriages for the tax savings. No matter that Warren’s proposal, if she is nominated then elected, still faces exceedingly long odds in what is expected to be a closely divided Senate.

“The markets probably won't really focus on the campaigns until the candidates have been set next year at the parties' conventions, says Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management,” Randall Forsyth writes in Barron’s. “Even so, Wall Street has taken notice of Warren's recent surge in the polls past Sanders, to second place behind [Biden].”

Indeed, Warren’s growing traction in the Democratic race is making a possible presidency more vivid for financiers she wants to subject to higher taxes and tougher regulation.

The latest Des Moines Register poll showed the senator leading in Iowa for the first time, edging ahead of Biden, 22 percent to 20 percent, though still within the survey’s 4 percent margin of error. And a new national Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll finds Biden and Warren separating from the rest of the field. Biden is backed by 31 percent, Warren pulled in 25 percent, and Sanders, at 14 percent, was the only other candidates with more than single-digit support.

The “ultimate irony,” Valliere writes, is that Trump “is going after the wrong opponent. His scorched earth assault on Biden comes as the former vice president is slipping into second place in the fight to win the nomination. Warren is the candidate Trump needs to worry about; simply calling her ‘Pocahontas’ will not be sufficient to stop her momentum.”

Warren's rise hasn't yet weighed on stock prices. But the rising level of alarm among investors suggests they may be clearer-eyed about Trump’s challengers than the president himself.

MARKET MOVERS

— Wall Street quant finds rising impeachment risk. The possibility of impeachment no longer drives market performance the way it did, say, in the opening months of Trump’s presidency, when the prospect of his ouster clouded the outlook for his corporate tax cut. But GeoQuant CEO Mark Rosenberg, whose firm uses artificial intelligence-powered indexes to chart different kinds of political risks, says Trump now faces the highest risk of impeachment yet. His ""Mueller Risk Index,"" which measures institutional support for the president, shows the threat to Trump spiking early next month:

“I am a bit surprised that these events pushed us to an all time peak--higher than late June 2017, when Mueller expanded the probe to include obstruction and was reportedly ordered to be fired by Trump,” Rosenberg emails. But he also notes his index shows the risk trailing off sharply after early next month, “suggesting that a successful impeachment remains quite unlikely.”

In one of the most high-profile cases to come before Britain’s Supreme Court, the 11 judges ruled unanimously that Johnson had not acted lawfully in shuttering Parliament...

""The decision was a brutal one for the embattled prime minister, asserting that his move to suspend the Parliament was political maneuver, and suggesting that he might have misled the queen... Johnson, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session, said he will not resign.""

— NY Fed: Central bank did the right thing last week. CNBC's Jeff Cox: ""New York Fed President John Williams said Monday that the central bank acted quickly during last week’s jolt to overnight lending markets and that the issue appears resolved for now. However, he cautioned that short-term lending markets face another crisis, though a few years in the distance, if banks don’t prepare themselves for when the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, is phased out. LIBOR is used as an international benchmark for overnight lending.

""Williams also said that there’s potential for further disruptions at the end of the quarter Sept. 30 and that the Fed is continuing to monitor the need for more reserves in the system.""

— Japan trade deal stalls: “The trade agreement [Trump] told Congress he had reached with Japan last week is now hung up amid Japanese concerns that Trump will still move to penalize their auto shipments to the United States, according to two people familiar with the negotiations,” my colleague David J. Lynch reports.

“Japanese officials have insisted they should be able to back out of the deal if Trump imposes these tariffs, something he has threatened to do for more than a year. This concern has emerged as the principal substantive issue before a formal pact can be signed, said the people, who weren’t authorized to discuss the private deliberations. Trump had wanted to ink the deal during the U.N. General Assembly session in New York, but that now appears unlikely.”

What might happen this week: “The finishing touches now are unlikely to be completed in time for Wednesday’s scheduled meeting between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But the leaders may sign a nonbinding statement, according to Japanese news reports.”

— China buys more soybeans after trade talks: “Chinese importers bought about 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans,” Reuters’s Karl Plume reports, a development that occurs “following deputy-level trade talks in Washington last week that were overshadowed by the abrupt cancellation of a U.S. farm state visit by Chinese agriculture officials.”

“Neumann has not yet agreed to step aside as CEO of WeWork parent We Company, and there is no certainty he will do so, the sources said.

The list of Democrats calling for Trump’s impeachment has been bolstered in recent days by revelations that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in a phone call that took place shortly after Trump had temporarily suspended military aid to the country.

Democrats have accused Trump of trying to pressure a foreign power to hurt Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential contender. Trump has acknowledged he held back the aid, but denies doing anything improper. On Tuesday, he said he was concerned the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries. He has previously said he was worried about corruption in Ukraine.

AD

In surveys of registered voters since the start of August, Trump has trailed Biden by 14 percentage points in a Fox News poll, by 15 points in a Washington Post-ABC poll, by 12 points in an Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP poll and by 16 points in a Quinnipiac University poll.

AD

When matched against four other Democratic candidates — Sen. Warren Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — Trump did not have an advantage against any of them. At best he trailed within the range of sampling error.

Recent polling has also shown Trump without a clear lead against top Democrats in several of the mostly closely contested states in 2016.

AD

In Michigan, for instance, an EPIC-MRA poll in August asked whether registered voters would support Trump against four different Democratic candidates.

Trump trailed Biden by 10 points, a statistically significant edge. Warren and Sanders held slight edges over Trump of 4 points and 5 points, respectively, while Harris had a 3-point lead, which was within the margin of error.

In Wisconsin, a Marquette Law School poll in August found Trump tied or behind Biden, Sanders, Warren and Harris among registered voters. Biden led Trump by 9 points; Sanders had a slight 4-point edge, while Warren and Harris were tied with Trump.

After President Trump’s Ukraine scandal drove a new wave of Democrats toward impeachment, on Tuesday afternoon House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally announced that the House will launch a formal impeachment inquiry. It’s obviously a huge step, but there’s still much confusion about what exactly presidential impeachment means, how the process works, and what consequences Trump is likely to face. Since it’s only happened twice in U.S. history (to Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, with Richard Nixon avoiding a near-certain impeachment by resigning), it’s not the sort of thing you get a lot of detail on in high-school American history classes. Here’s what you need to know.

What Is Impeachment?

Impeachment is to official misconduct what an indictment is to crime: a statement of charges leading to a trial. The procedure for congressional impeachment of Executive branch officials (including but not limited to the president) was spelled out in some detail in the U.S. Constitution, as the official House of Representatives history observes:

Impeachment comes from British constitutional history. The process evolved from the 14th century as a way for parliament to hold the king’s ministers accountable for their public actions. Impeachment, as Alexander Hamilton of New York explained in Federalist 65, varies from civil or criminal courts in that it strictly involves the “misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust.” Individual state constitutions had provided for impeachment for “maladministration” or “corruption” before the U.S. Constitution was written. And the founders, fearing the potential for abuse of executive power, considered impeachment so important that they made it part of the Constitution even before they defined the contours of the presidency.

Impeachment is not, to be clear, the removal of corrupt presidents or other officials, but simply the adoption of charges by the House, triggering a trial in the Senate. So Johnson and Clinton were impeached, as the House passed articles of impeachment against them; though they were subsequently acquitted by the Senate, the term still applies. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to consummate an impeachment with removal from office, but the document is otherwise silent about procedures.

What Are Grounds for Impeaching a President?

Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution specifically mentions “treason” and “bribery” as grounds for impeachment, but it also stipulates that “other High Crimes and Misdemeanors” are sufficient. It’s important to understand that when the Constitution was adopted, the term “misdemeanors” had not assumed its later meaning as a type of criminal offense. According to the most common interpretation of this language, impeachment does not require the allegation of a crime, but simply some grave act or pattern of misconduct deemed by Congress as necessitating this radical remedy.

Under House rules and long-standing practice, the House lays out the grounds for impeachment, then holds a simple majority vote. If the articles of impeachment are approved, they’re then presented to the Senate for further action.

In 1868, the House approved 11 articles of impeachment against President Johnson, mostly revolving around his defiance of the (quite possibly unconstitutional) Tenure of Office Act, which restricted the president’s power to dismiss Cabinet members (the underlying “offense” was clearly Johnson’s efforts to obstruct congressional Reconstruction of the former Confederate States).

In 1998, the House approved just two articles of impeachment against Clinton: one alleged that he committed perjury in grand jury testimony when questioned about his sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky, and the second alleged obstruction of justice to hide evidence in that case. It was a highly legalistic argument, which helped buttress the false public impression that without “crimes” there can be no impeachment.

How Does Impeachment Begin?

This has been perhaps the most confusing aspect of the current debate over impeaching Trump. In past presidential impeachments, the House has formally voted to authorize the Judiciary Committee to initiate impeachment proceedings. But this step has been skipped on occasion in the impeachment of judges, and it’s entirely the product of custom and internal House rules (themselves interpreted and controlled by the House majority at a given time).

After the Mueller Report was released and the special counsel himself had finally testified before Congress, House Democrats were deeply divided on whether to “initiate” impeachment proceedings, with Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler voicing reluctance to go in that direction. Then, in what was either a clever or devious maneuver, depending on your point of view, Nadler let it be known in early August that his committee was already engaged in an impeachment “inquiry,” as CNN explained at the time:

The House Judiciary Committee is now engaged in a full-blown investigation and legal fight with the goal of deciding whether to recommend articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump by the end of the year, according to Democratic officials involved in the effort …

As additional House Democrats continue to call for the House Judiciary Committee to launch an impeachment inquiry — which more than half the caucus now supports — Democratic sources say the issue is essentially moot since what the panel is doing is basically that: investigating whether Trump should be impeached.

As I noted at the time, “According to this interpretation of the situation, there’s no need to ‘launch’ anything, or to put House Democrats on the spot with some vote to begin ‘proceedings’ that are already underway.” House Republicans might (and did) complain that a vital step had been left out, but there wasn’t much they could do about it.

But what had looked like a successful effort to postpone any House vote until actual articles of impeachment were considered unraveled under the pressure of Trump’s scofflaw behavior – specifically, the Ukraine scandal and rising House Democratic sentiment favoring a more aggressive posture. While Pelosi’s announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry implicitly endorses Nadler’s claim that ongoing House investigations are an impeachment probe, the House could return to its old procedures and formally authorize such proceedings.

There’s been further confusion about the scope of the impeachment inquiry. During her September 26 press conference (the first she held after announcing the inquiry), Pelosi suggested a phased operation, as I explained:

… Speaker Nancy Pelosi made it clearer than before that the impeachment inquiry she announced yesterday would — for now, at least — focus exclusively on the president’s dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Indeed, she indicated that the House Intelligence Committee would have the primary responsibility for uncovering the facts that might or might not justify actual articles of impeachment (she was adamant that no decision had been made on the ultimate outcome of the “inquiry”).

So for the time being, Jerrold Nadler’s Judiciary Committee (normally the focal point of impeachment proceedings) will be on hold, except for its ongoing investigations of the president and his administration.

That could change later, if House Democrats do decide to pursue articles of impeachment.

Pelosi did hold open the possibility that previous examples of the president’s “lawlessness” could be the subject of impeachment articles if the House went in that direction, as many of those who supported impeachment before the Ukraine scandal broke into public view are insisting upon. But she seemed determined to convey a belief that the public would see Trump’s behavior in the Ukraine incident as reflecting a “different level of lawlessness,” just as she did in “crossing the Rubicon” from opposition to impeachment proceedings to support for them.

There are indications that Pelosi has asked other committees that have been investigating Trump or his administration to put together materials supporting articles of impeachment that could be considered by the Judiciary Committee once the Ukraine investigation is complete.

How Long Do Impeachment Hearings Last?

Some Democrats resisting impeachment fear that it’s too late, or too deeply into the 2020 presidential election cycle, to begin impeachment hearings. Some point to the terrible performance of House Republicans in the 1998 midterms, which were overshadowed by impeachment talk (Clinton’s impeachment was opposed by a majority of Americans, much as polls suggest the public opposes the impeachment of Trump today).

Another consequence of the hazy rules governing the steps leading up to impeachment is that there’s no clear expectation about the duration or depth of impeachment hearings. As Vox’s Andrew Prokop has pointed out, the two most recent precedents point in very different directions:

The Nixon inquiry was an intensive, lengthy investigative effort that proceeded alongside the special prosecutor’s continuing grand jury investigation into the Watergate break-in and cover-up and a Senate select committee inquiry into the matter. The House Judiciary Committee opened it in October 1973 (after the Saturday Night Massacre), the House voted to back it in February 1974, and it lasted until July 1974. Major new revelations about the scandal kept breaking throughout that period, and eventually, the committee got to review secret information from the grand jury probe.

The Clinton inquiry, meanwhile, was essentially just a decision about whether to impeach the president based on the findings of independent counsel Ken Starr’s report (which alleged Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice to try to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky). That impeachment inquiry was officially opened in the Judiciary Committee after votes by the committee and then the whole House in October 1998. The committee held a few weeks of hearings and heard witness testimony (including from Starr), but it wasn’t really a new investigation, and it was over by mid-December.

It appears House Democrats are trying to balance the need for relatively simple and expeditious proceedings with concerns that they might appear to be “rushing to judgment.” Here’s the current thinking about the pace:

NEW w/ @rachaelmbade -- Dems eye impeachment sprint over coming weeks...

-Intel Cmte takes lead on Ukraine as other cmtes wrap probes

-Few, if any hearings

-No set timeline, but some Dems eyeing floor vote around T'givinghttps://t.co/u95zqb9K1k — Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) September 26, 2019

On the other hand, you could see the pace dictated by public opinion, with Pelosi in particular looking for evidence that the hearings were softening independent and even Republican opposition to impeachment.

How Does the House Vote on Impeachment Itself?

Under all precedents, the Judiciary Committee will debate and vote upon each proposed article of impeachment, and if any are approved (and of course there would be no committee vote unless success was assured), they are reported to the full House for debate and a conclusive vote for impeachment.

Typically, the party pushing impeachment will favor a tight set of resolutions that revolve around a clear pattern of malfeasance, and that might even attract members of the president’s party (or at least some of his supporters).

In July of 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three of five proposed articles impeaching Nixon. The first to draw a vote, alleging presidential obstruction of justice, attracted six of the committee’s 17 Republicans. Though two other articles were subsequently reported, one was sufficient for impeachment and a Senate trial, so the committee vote led directly to Nixon’s resignation before the House could formally impeach him.

In Clinton’s case, the Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment, with committee Democrats voting en bloc against all of them. Enough Republicans defected on the House floor to defeat two of these articles, and only five Democrats voted for the crucial article impeaching Clinton for lying under oath to a federal grand jury about his relationship to Lewinsky.

If a President Is Impeached, Does the Senate Have to Hold a Trial?

Most experts believe the provisions made for an impeachment trial in both the Constitution and in Senate rules mean some sort of proceedings are obligatory. But then we are talking about Mitch McConnell being in charge, and even if you think he is required to hold a trial, who is going to enforce that requirement? The courts are likely to stay away from a conflict as a “political question.”

But McConnell has publicly talked about holding impeachment trials as though it’s not a real question, most recently describing it as obligatory:

McConnell, to CNBC, on the Senate's obligation if the House impeaches Trump:



""I would have no choice but to take it up."" — Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) September 30, 2019

You’d also have to figure Republicans will want some deliberations, however superficial, so they can claim Trump has been exonerated.

There are not, however, constitutional or Senate provisions requiring a trial of any particular length or depth. And it could go pretty fast, as I noted earlier this year:

Chief Justice John Roberts would preside over any impeachment trial, but Mitch McConnell would determine the schedule and the Senate itself could by a simple majority vote (almost certainly a party-line vote) control evidence and witnesses. In the unlikely event there are four Senate Republicans (the minimum requisite number to deny their party a majority) willing to buck McConnell on any particular controversy involving impeachment, the odds are very high such dissenters will want a quick trial to limit partisan blowback. All in all, it’s clear that if the House impeaches Trump, you can expect a Senate acquittal with as much speed as any kangaroo court could devise.

If there is anything like a real trial, it is assumed the House’s representatives (or “managers”) will be given an opportunity to present and explain the articles of impeachment on which the trial will be based, much like prosecutors in criminal cases (though in the Clinton case, the Senate chose not to let the managers call live witnesses). The president typically can choose representatives to present his case (Clinton’s defense was led by attorney Charles Ruff, whose team included former Arkansas senator Dale Bumpers). According to precedent, senators act like jurors, making no public statements on the proceeding until after their votes are cast (in the Clinton case, senators spoke before the vote in a closed-door session, with their remarks published in the Congressional Record after the vote).

The Johnson impeachment trial in 1868 lasted from March 5 until May 16, when the Senate’s first crucial “test vote” on a catch-all article of impeachment failed by one vote. Ten days later the Senate voted predictably to acquit on two other articles, and subsequently voted for general acquittal and adjournment.

Clinton’s impeachment trial was more hurried: It began on January 7, 1999, when presiding officer Chief Justice William Rehnquist was sworn in, and ended on February 12, with Clinton’s easy acquittal on both articles (45 senators, all Republicans, voted for his guilt on the perjury article, with ten Republicans defecting; and 50 senators vote for the obstruction article, with five Republicans defecting).

What Are the Odds the Senate Would Vote to Convict Trump and Remove Him From Office?

As indicated above, the odds of Trump being removed via impeachment range from “slim” to “none.” It would take only 34 of 54 Senate Republicans to acquit Trump, and the idea that 20 senators from a party dominated by this president like a Bronze Age warlord would defy the MAGA base and try to defenestrate him on the brink of an epochal presidential election is, in a word, laughable. And that’s true no matter what Nadler’s committee uncovers, or what journalists dig up, or what the president himself admits in one of his moments when his belief in his own invincibility overcomes all good judgment (“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn’t lose any voters,” he famously boasted). Perhaps there is a theoretical set of events that could rapidly erode Trump’s partisan invincibility the way Watergate gradually eroded Nixon’s, but it’s hard to imagine and impossible to expect.

So How Is This All Likely to End?

Assuming Trump is impeached and then acquitted, this saga will conclude with the 2020 presidential election, and with Trump’s ejection from office or his triumphal reelection. It’s possible, of course, that whether or not the current impeachment drive goes anywhere, a second-term Trump could get himself impeached (indeed, some Democratic opponents of impeaching Trump now think this option should be saved for later, when his conduct would undoubtedly become far worse). But most likely his impeachment, or even impeachment hearings, will reinforce the sense that the 2020 election is a high-stakes referendum on the sprawling corruption, norm-breaking, and racist and sexist attitudes of the 45th president.

It’s the possible impact of impeachment on Trump’s reelection that has caused so many arguments among Democrats (mostly in Washington, since rank-and-file Democrats have been trending pro-impeachment for some time). Best we can tell from polls, the public is not making any sort of fine distinctions between “initiating impeachment proceedings” or impeaching Trump or removing him from office. Once Democrats head decisively down that road they may as well follow it until its logical end. Some sincerely believe impeachment will hurt Trump in 2020 by focusing public attention on his misconduct and conveying a clear sense of Democratic purpose in holding him and his corrupt hirelings accountable (or conversely, that failing to impeach Trump will depress Democratic “base” enthusiasm). Others (most clearly presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren) argue that it’s a constitutional or moral duty even if it helps produce the horror of a second Trump term.

Any way you look at it, the implications of what House Democrats now decide to do could be momentous yet hard to adjudge until the ultimate deal goes down.

DECORAH, Iowa — The crowd that came to see Bernie Sanders was too big for Luther College's gym. It spilled over into a yard, where the senator delivered a short version of his stump speech — “the fate of the planet is at stake, democracy is at stake” — before he walked into a room full of “Bernie Beats Trump” signs.

But not everyone who showed up was sold on that message.

“I'm not necessarily a Bernie fan,” said Justin Knautz, 20, who said he was leaning toward South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigeg. “Even if he could beat Trump, which I'm not sure about, our country's so divided already.”

“I'm super confident that he'd win,” Avery Pazour, 20, said of Sanders. “Young people are tired of the system the way that it is.”

“I'm exactly the opposite,” said Marin Gabor, 21. “I like Pete Buttigieg's public-health option. I guess that's a weird thing for a young person to say?""

Five months after Sanders began arguing that he was the most electable Democratic candidate, a pitch he made with a tour of Rust Belt states, he has made little progress with voters terrified of a second Trump term. National and state polling has found Sanders persistently behind former vice president Joe Biden when voters are asked who has the best chance of defeating the president. In the past month, polling has found Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) roughly tied with Sanders on “electability.”

The “Bernie beats Trump” tour was the latest attempt to push back. That meant showing what a general election would look like, with the candidate leading raw, emotional town hall meetings where voters explained how the economic system failed them. It meant emphasizing that polling had shown him ahead of Trump in 2016 — an argument he briefly made to “superdelegates.” It meant reminding people that he had won the primaries in Wisconsin and Michigan, where some Democrats slept on the 2016 general election.

In Iowa, Sanders occasionally referred to the national and state polls that have shown him ahead of Trump, but in an interview, he waved off the polling that had shown Democratic voters still nervous about how a democratic socialist could take the presidency.

“I'm not much into all these speculations and all these polls,” Sanders said. “One day a poll has me doing great, the next day a poll has me doing terrible. It has a lot to do with who you're polling and what questions you're asking. But at the end of the day, I think we're going to win, because we have an extraordinary grass-roots movement.”

Apart from some turnover in its early state staff, the Sanders campaign has shown some broad support. It celebrated its 1 millionth individual donor last week; shortly after that, it drew an estimated 4,000 voters to a rally in Norman, Okla. (A 2016 rally in Tulsa, three times the size of Norman, had attracted a crowd of 11,000.)

But it has struggled to convince early-state voters that Sanders could win a general election, and the senator's support in early states has slipped since the start of his campaign. In interviews around the state, some at the senator from Vermont's rallies, voters sometimes praised Sanders or explained why they used to support him before laying out the reasons that they were supporting someone else.

“I love him. We caucused for him in 2016,” said Scott German, 50, who spent Monday evening at a rally for Buttigieg in Dubuque. “If he could win and put forward everything he's talking about, it'd be utopia. But I don't think America's ready for it. We need somebody more realistic.”

Sanders's campaign is combating the skepticism with a busy schedule and with sharp contrasts, some of them brighter than others. When Sanders announced his 1 millionth donor, campaign manager Faiz Shakir described him as “the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grass-roots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump” — a knock at Warren, who has said her no-fundraisers pledge applies to only the primary and who is headlining some fundraisers for the DNC.

Speech by speech, Sanders has structured an electability pitch around his brand — that of an Old Testament prophet who has been saying the same things about health care and economic fairness for 30 years. At four rallies on Monday, he emphasized that taxes would go up to pay for Medicare-for-all, encouraging the crowd to think about how the media would frame that.

“Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes! How terrible is this guy?” Sanders said sarcastically in Decorah, waving his arms and imitating a negative ad. The upshot: He was ready to handle the criticism, some candidates were not, and therefore, he could win.

That theory is getting a real-time test in Iowa, one that has not gone well for Sanders. His campaign believes that the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a front group for insurance companies, has done damage to his support among Democrats by running digital and TV ads attacking Medicare-for-all. (Sanders has not yet purchased TV time in early states.) The senator's favorable numbers have decreased since the spring, robbing supporters of something that was true for years: that he was the most popular politician in America.

“There's a lot of lies going on about this,” Sanders said in Dubuque. “There's the health-care industry that's already advertising in here in Iowa. Every time you see that ad, know who paid for that ad! It was paid for by the drug companies and the insurance companies who made a hundred billion in profits last year. They love the current system! They're scared to death that we have the momentum to move to Medicare-for-all.”

The insurance industry ads make good foils, but Sanders is just as happy to criticize Biden. After learning that a pollster at Anzalone Liszt Grove Research had been testing messages against Medicare-for-all — John Anzalone is an adviser to Biden — Sanders emphasized that he was collecting story after story of medical debt, denied coverage and personal pain. Even after his events ended, he was being buttonholed by people with insurance horror stories. At every event, Sanders sees a story that is not being told in the corporate media. As the nominee, with that media bound to cover him, he could cut through the fog, he believes.

“If Joe Biden or anybody else wants to use the Republican Party and the health-care industry talking points, I guess they can. But we're going to win this fight because we're going to refute that disingenuous attack,” Sanders said. “You know, I think when I raised the issue during the last debate, that we spend twice as much, Biden's response was, 'This is America.' Well, I don't know that Americans have to be chumps and to give the health-care industry $100 billion a year.”

Polling has found Democrats to be nervous about that argument, even if they agree with Sanders on the merits. In the Des Moines Register's weekend poll, a quarter of Democrats said they supported the concept of Medicare-for-all but were worried it was a general election loser — a threat to the entire Sanders premise.

At a Democratic meeting in Story County on Sunday, Linda Trudeau, 72, said that had never been convinced that Sanders could win. Warren had piqued her interest, she said, because she seemed liberal, but less stubborn.

“She's got to give up Medicare-for-all or she won't get elected,” said Trudeau. “She's not quite nailed down on that, unlike Bernie. That's a good thing.”

ON THE TRAIL

Pete Buttigieg speaks at a campaign event in Clinton, Iowa, on Tuesday. (Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters)

DUBUQUE, Iowa — First, there are the introductions from local Democrats. Then there’s the theme song — “High Hopes” by Panic! at the Disco, with a brass hook that tests the integrity of speakers and eardrums. Then the bus — a bus previously hired by everyone from Barack Obama to the producers of “Madam Secretary” — rolls into view. Only then does Pete Buttigieg race onto stage.

“Thanks for making me feel right at home!” Buttigieg told the crowd, 800 voters at an amphitheater on the banks of the Mississippi River. “You know, Dubuque has a great reputation among mayors — an example of a city leading the way, when Washington can’t get its act together.”

Buttigieg, one of the few Democrats whose favorability has increased over the primary campaign, is busy reintroducing himself as the candidate who can talk about anything — no gaffes, no dodges. On the bus, Buttigieg took questions on everything from college football (“problematic”) to how many white button-down shirts he owned (“a baker’s dozen”) to the violent abolitionist John Brown (“kind of a brutal guy”). When his Dubuque speech was over, Buttigieg worked the rope line for a half-hour, then walked over to the few reporters not on the bus to take more questions.

It wasn't an entirely new strategy. Buttigieg's early jump in the polls came after he did interview after interview, saying yes to TV shows and small outlets that were used to getting turned down. Most voters would not hear everything he said, but they could see that he was taking any questions.

The bus tour, and the entire media strategy, was also designed to show a contrast. The voters seen as most gettable for Buttigieg are moderates who have been disappointed by Joe Biden; the former vice president holds frequent media availabilities but has made a series of confusing statements, all of them amplified by social media.

Buttigieg's accessibility also contrasts with the candidates who've commanded the most attention so far, and for different reasons. Elizabeth Warren's short press gaggles are designed to make minimal news, and in the past week, she swerved back to a stock answer when asked whether her Medicare plans would raise “middle-class taxes” — something Buttigieg pounced on.

“Sen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question,” Buttigieg had told CNN before the start of the tour. “And we've seen that repeatedly.”

Buttigieg's approach also clashed with Kamala Harris, whose uneasy answers to some policy questions sapped her momentum, and with Bernie Sanders, who often urges reporters to steer back to his preferred topic instead of badgering him about the horse race or the latest Trump news. With that group of competitors, and with a support base that gushes about his ability to communicate, Buttigieg's advantage was clear: He could go on the record about anything. The comparison with other candidates would become obvious.

“I will explain how we will pay for every promise that I make,” Buttigieg said in Dubuque. “It's why I'm a little careful about the promises I do make.”

On the stump, Buttigieg did not mention rival candidates by name. “I think I've named my disagreements with their plans at various times,” he explained afterward. Other candidates, such as Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, have also described their plans as realistic, or truth-telling — candidates who promise more than could probably pass, or plans that aren't fully paid for, get described as less straightforward. Asked whether he would rule out any middle-class tax increases, Buttigieg emphasized that nothing he was for had required them.

“Everything that we've rolled out to date can be achieved without a middle-class tax increase, and we're going to make sure that it's clear how the revenue side will work,” he said. “It does mean tax increases for the top 2 percent. It will mean a wealth tax or something like it. It can certainly mean closing corporate tax loopholes.”

How far would the transparency go? Several campaigns lagging behind Buttigieg have criticized him for holding so many fundraisers. Unlike Biden, who has faced the same criticism, Buttigieg has not let the media in to cover those fundraisers.

“We're open to thinking about it,” he said. “I think right now we're focused on what we can achieve on the bus tour, because it's just a different conversation than any other format that we have. But the team will always evaluate strategy and other ideas.”

POLL WATCH

New Hampshire Democratic primary (Monmouth, 401 likely Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 27% ( 19)

Joe Biden — 25% (-9)

Bernie Sanders — 12% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg — 10% ( 1)

Kamala Harris — 3% (-3)

Cory Booker — 2% (-)

Tulsi Gabbard — 2% ( 2)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% (-)

Tom Steyer — 2% ( 2)

Andrew Yang — 2% ( 1)

Beto O’Rourke — 1% (-1)

Marianne Williamson — 1% ( 1)

Polling in the first primary state has found (with different methodology) everything from a sizable lead for Bernie Sanders to resilient support for Joe Biden. This is the first major poll to find Elizabeth Warren positioned in the lead, albeit within the margin of error; more important is her favorable rating, which has risen since May from a net 39 points to a net 55 points, higher than any other candidate. Warren's strength extends even to voters who disagree with her on health care; she wins 40 percent of Democrats who, like she, support single-payer, but wins 25 percent among Democrats who support a ""public option"" instead. Warren's positioning might be helping her; she has endorsed a bevy of liberal health-care bills and is not as strongly associated as Sanders with Medicare-for-all.

Nevada Democratic caucus (Suffolk, 500 likely voters)

Joe Biden — 23%

Elizabeth Warren — 19%

Bernie Sanders — 14%

Kamala Harris — 4%

Pete Buttigieg — 3%

Cory Booker — 3%

Tom Steyer — 3%

Andrew Yang — 3%

Tulsi Gabbard — 1%

Michael Bennet — 1%

Beto O’Rourke — 1%

Julián Castro — 1%

The least-visited early state — even Democrats sometimes forget that it caucuses before South Carolina votes — has no obvious favorite. A tiny plurality of voters said that Elizabeth Warren did worse than they expected in the September debate; a tiny plurality said that Joe Biden did worse than they expected.

DEBATE SEASON

The fifth DNC debates, which will be held sometime in November, will introduce new, strict thresholds for entry in the latest effort to limit the party's biggest nights to candidates with widespread support. The short version: Candidates will need 165,000 individual donations (up from 130,000) to get space onstage, and polling at 2 percent won't cut it anymore.

In the new rules, candidates can reach the polling threshold in two ways: by hitting 3 percent in four polls (or more) recognized by the DNC or by hitting 5 percent in two (or more) polls taken in the first four primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The count started Sept. 13; it'll stop seven days before the date of the fifth debate, which has not yet been announced.

The DNC is transparent about which polls it counts. They are: the Associated Press; ABC News-Washington Post; CBS News-YouGov; CNN; Des Moines Register; Fox News; Monmouth University; NPR; NBC News-Wall Street Journal; NBC News-Marist; New York Times; Quinnipiac University; University of New Hampshire; USA Today-Suffolk University; and Winthrop University, which polls in South Carolina.

At the moment, using these standards, just five candidates have qualified for the November debate: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Just four other candidates have claimed to reach that new donor threshold: Tom Steyer, Tulsi Gabbard, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang.

2020

Joe Biden. He gave a prepared statement in Wilmington, Del., addressing the Ukraine saga more fully by saying no allegation about his son Hunter had merit and that the president was setting himself on a course to impeachment: “a tragedy of his own making.”

Tulsi Gabbard. She qualified for the fourth Democratic debate, after notching her fourth poll at 2 percent support — the Monmouth poll from New Hampshire. That significantly ups the chances of CNN, the debate's TV host, splitting the debate into two nights, each with six candidates.

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a new version of a “wealth tax,” a concept that he had introduced five years ago but that Elizabeth Warren had formulated for this presidential campaign. Unlike Warren's 2 percent tax (which has been strong when polled), Sanders's would tackle wealth in tiers: a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million, a 4 percent tax on net worth between $500 million and $1 billion, a 5 percent tax on net worth between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, a 6 percent tax on net worth between $2.5 billion $5 billion, a 7 percent tax on net worth between $5 billion and $10 billion, and an 8 percent tax on net worth above $10 billion.

Elizabeth Warren. She'll return to New Hampshire on Wednesday and Friday, her first visits to the state since shifts in polling found her in contention to win the primary. In a Q&A with the Council on Foreign Relations, she laid out her policies on issues not much discussed at campaign events, such as the fate of Venezuela's embattled president.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Pick your metaphor — the dam is breaking, or maybe the floodgates, or maybe the Rubicon is being crossed — but House Democrats have begun moving faster toward some form of impeachment, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. The president's apparent effort to obtain damaging information on Joe Biden's son in a call with Ukraine's president has pushed dozens of “front-line” Democrats into the fray; in the past 48 hours, more Democrats who represent districts won by President Trump have endorsed impeachment than had endorsed it in the past nine months.

Republicans claim to be overjoyed. “They’re obsessed with impeaching President Trump and they don’t care if they have to throw away the House Majority to do it,” wrote Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the House GOP's super PAC, after a group of Trump-seat Democrats came out for impeachment proceedings.

Thirty-one House Democrats represent districts won by the president in 2016, but they're not all created equal.

Blue-trending districts. Ten House Democrats won 2018 races in areas where Donald Trump ran behind Mitt Romney, from the Detroit suburbs won by Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan to the Chicago exurbs won by Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. And some of these districts voted for the statewide Democratic tickets last year, suggesting that the Trump brand has continued to hurt local Republicans.

Trump-trending districts. Twenty-one Democrats represent districts that either edged a toward the president in 2016, some by a little (Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia's district went from a 2.3-point Mitt Romney win to 3.4-point Trump win), some by a lot (Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota's massive district backed Mitt Romney by 9.8 points, then Trump by 30.8 points). Twelve of them come from places that flipped from backing Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Trump four years later.

Democrats with/without real opponents. The filing deadline for 2020 races is months away; only Illinois and Texas require House candidates to file by the end of this year. But not every Democrat who flipped a House seat last year is facing a real challenge yet. Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania is facing a first-time challenger who has raised less than $20,000; Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan hasn't drawn a Republican opponent. On the other side of the equation are Democrats such as Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, whose chief opponent, Wesley Hunt, raised more than $500,000 in just a few months as a candidate; after Fletcher joined the impeachment call, Hunt accused her of endorsing a ""blatantly partisan impeachment investigation.”

“The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said in brief remarks. “Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”...

Pelosi’s change of heart comes after days of consulting allies and follows reports that Trump may have pressured a foreign leader to investigate former vice president and potential 2020 campaign rival Joe Biden and his family.

Those reports over a seven-day period created a groundswell of support among Democrats for impeachment, with moderates from swing districts joining liberals in calling for an inquiry.

A confused reader passed along a tweet with a clip of these remarks. What was Biden talking about?

AD

After all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.

AD

Biden’s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:

He meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.

He meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck. (The line he used in the last primary debate was: “It’s going to cost you in your pay — there will be a deductible in your paycheck”).

He meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not “5 percent and 4 percent.”

We understand politicians can misspeak — though Biden seems to do it more often than most — so we won’t be awarding Pinocchios. But the point he was trying to make gets to the heart of the debate about the cost of a single-payer health plan. So it’s worth exploring this issue and explaining it to readers, especially because more than 100,000 people watched the video embedded in the tweet.

AD

The Facts

Sanders, as Biden noted, has said his plan will raise taxes, but argues that the cost of health care will be lower overall. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), rising fast in the polls, has embraced Sanders’s plan but studiously avoids answering any questions about a possible tax increase. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) used to support the Sanders plan but then crafted her own version, in part because of what she called “a middle-class tax hike” embedded in the plan. Her plan would phase in much more slowly and still retain a role for private insurance.

AD

Biden has rejected a single-payer approach and advocated building on the Affordable Care Act, the law expanding health-care access passed during the Obama administration.

AD

Actually, no one really knows what would happen. You have to take any of the numbers offered by advocates and detractors with a huge grain of salt. As we have documented before, the cost of any health-care proposal will be affected by a variety of factors, including provider payments, health-care benefits, cost-sharing and administrative savings from a consolidated system. Any complex bill overhauling health care faces daunting prospects in a closely divided Congress.

But for the sake of argument, let’s look at the numbers Biden and Sanders are using.

Sanders has offered a menu of possible options to finance the cost of Medicare-for-all. One option would require a 7.5 percent payroll tax that employers would pay to help fund the program. Another would be a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households. (That’s what Harris labeled a middle-class tax hike.)

AD

AD

But Sanders argues that those taxes would be cheaper than the current system.

Sanders offers as an example a prototypical family of four earning $50,000. He says the employer is currently paying $12,865 a year in health-care premiums for this family, while the family pays $5,277 in premiums. Virtually every economist will tell you that payroll taxes or health-insurance premiums paid by an employer largely comes out of the pay earned by the employee.

For instance, both employers and employees pay 6.2 percent to Social Security (on the first $132,900 of wages) and 1.45 percent to Medicare. The employer obviously counts that 7.65 percent ($3,825 for a $50,000 wage) as part of the cost of employing that person, as well as the nearly $13,000 in health insurance premiums. To the employer, the cost of that employee is not $50,000, but almost $67,000. (There are tax deductions for employer-provided health insurance, but we will ignore them as part of this illustration.)

AD

AD

But note that almost $13,000 in insurance premiums is 26 percent of $50,000. Sanders’s 7.5 percent tax would be $3,750, so that suggests more than $9,000 in savings for the employer. Under Medicare-for-all, the total cost of the employee to the employer would be a little over $57,000, a reduction of more than $9,000.

As for the 4 percent income premium paid by the employee, that amounts to $844 a year, once the standard deduction is taken into account, Sanders says. That’s far less than the nearly $5,300 in premiums currently paid by this family.

Biden, by contrast, only focuses on the cost of tax increase (apparently because polling has found that it’s a way to undercut support for Medicare-for-all). In the debate, Biden argued that a three-person family earning $60,000 a year will face more than $5,000 in taxes — the 4 percent premium tax ($1,240 after the standard deduction) and the 7.5 percent tax paid by employers ($4,500), on the widely accepted economic theory that payroll taxes paid by employers are passed onto employees.

AD

AD

Notice that he did not take into account any of the savings that Sanders claims his plan will generate both for the employee and employer. So he’s really only telling half the story, misleadingly ignoring a possible reduction in health-care costs for many Americans.

Sanders also chose an example in which the numbers work in his favor. The savings for the employer fade as an employee’s wages increase.

Sanders also focuses on the cost of a family plan, which has much higher premiums. The Milliman Medical Index, a respected accounting of health-care costs, says the employer contribution in 2019 will be $3,773 per person. (Total health-care costs for a family of four on an employer-provided plan are $28,386, Milliman says.) So a single person making $50,000 in theory would barely represent any savings for that employer — a 7.5 percent payroll tax on $50,000 is $3,750 — and the tax would quickly be higher than current expenses as wages increase.

AD

AD

Similarly, wealthier Americans would end up paying much more in taxes than they currently pay for health-care premiums. (We take no position on whether that’s good or bad, and certainly Sanders and Warren have been forthright in saying the wealthy would largely finance the plan.)

The uncertain complexity was examined in a 2018 University of Massachusetts at Amherst study that predicted the impact of enacting Medicare-for-all in a variety of employer and employee scenarios. The report does not examine all of the same financing options as Sanders, but it calculated that a three-person family with $60,000 income would gain almost $1,600 (2.6 percent) in additional income under Medicare-for-all, while a family with income of $221,000 (top 20 percent of wages earners), would lose $8,520 (3.9 percent) and a family with $401,000 (top 5 percent) would lose $22,340 (5.6 percent). (To create these scenarios, the report relies on data for 2016 mean incomes for various income ranges.)

Meanwhile, the report said most businesses would see a reduction in costs with even an 8.2 percent payroll tax but that firms of more than 500 employees would experience a 5.7 percent increase in health-care costs.

AD

AD

“Vice President Biden’s priority as president will be to make sure every single American has access to affordable, quality health insurance in the quickest, most cost-effective way possible,” Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said. “That’s why his plan is to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option, allowing people to choose between this new option and their private plan, and taking other steps to lower health-care costs. Biden has also made clear that any health-care plan that raises taxes on the middle class is a nonstarter.”

The Bottom Line

Biden emphasizes the higher taxes that Medicare-for-all would impose while ignoring the fact that for many middle-class Americans (if you accept Sanders’s math) the change may result in higher incomes and lower health-care costs. It’s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation, and we will keep an eye on how Biden frames this in the future to see if he merits Pinocchios.

AD

Biden may have bungled his lines at the town hall, but he still has not developed an effective or sophisticated counterargument to Sanders’s prediction of lower overall costs. You can understand why Warren has generally refused to even acknowledge that there are higher taxes embedded in Medicare-for-all. She stays focused instead on an overall reduction in costs, clearly not wanting to engage in a debate on Biden’s playing field.

AD

Of the 11 education secretaries (not including those who served in an acting capacity), three were K-12 teachers: John B. King Jr. under President Barack Obama; Terrel Bell under President Ronald Reagan, and Roderick Paige under President George W. Bush. The rest, nope. Several of them, however, did have experience teaching in higher education, and one, Lauro F. Cavazos, who served under Reagan and President George H.W. Bush, was president of a university.

AD

But DeVos’s attitude about traditional public schools — she once called them a “dead end” — and her poor performance at her confirmation hearing in Congress, rallied Democrats against her, and she became the first Cabinet member in U.S. history to be confirmed when the vice president broke a tie.

Warren, a former teacher, went directly after DeVos in that same May email, saying: “I’ll just be blunt: Betsy DeVos is the worst secretary of education we’ve seen.”

AD

Her promise to hire a teacher as DeVos’s successor was met with support — and prompted several other Democratic candidates to say the same thing if they were to win.

So is hiring an educator as secretary an automatic slam dunk? This is the question that veteran educator Peter Greene explores in the post below. It first appeared in Forbes, and Greene gave me permission to republish it.

AD

By Peter Greene

One up-and-coming education policy idea that was first proposed by Elizabeth Warren, but has now garnered wider candidate support, is the notion that a teacher should be the next secretary of education. At last count, four major candidates were supporting some version of the idea. It’s an arresting and appealing idea.

AD

Betsy DeVos is widely seen as a controversial opponent of public education, and in many education circles, predecessors such as Arne Duncan (who served President Obama) were not much loved, either. Many teachers feel that the folks in Washington just don’t get it, so the idea of someone from the trenches who would, presumably, get it — well, it’s an attractive idea.

But is it a good idea?

The devil, as always, is in the details. The idea has been expressed variously as appointing an educator, a public school teacher, or “someone who comes from public schools.” That may seem pretty straightforward. It isn't.

AD

“Educator” is a loose umbrella term to cover anyone who has held an education-adjacent job: teacher, administrator, education advocacy group member, school bus driver, education-specializing lawyer, or real estate salesman who once opened a charter school.

AD

“Public school” is not a clear term, because charter advocates assert that charter schools (privately owned and operated schools fed with public tax dollars) are public schools.

Even “teacher” has become a fuzzy term. Teach For America has created a small army of “former teachers” who have only two years of actual classroom experience. Critics have directed lots of attention at TFA’s program that claims to prepare college grads for a classroom in just five weeks. Less attention has been paid to how TFA produces “education policy experts” who have only two years of classroom experience.

AD

Those TFA grads have moved into a variety of powerful positions, from leaders of large city school systems to heads of entire state public education systems to founders and heads of their own charter schools. And while some TFA grads have emerged from the program as solid career supporters of public education, some remain aligned with the kind of corporate education reform that is unsupportive of public education.

AD

In short, the candidates could appoint someone like controversial former D.C. Chancellor Michelle Rhee and honor the letter of their pledge. But it would not much alter the trajectory set for the department by past secretaries.

So assuming that the newly appointed secretary was an actual working public school classroom teacher, would that be a good idea?

A classroom teacher would face some significant hurdles. DeVos lacks experience in running a large, complicated organization, nor has she shown a great deal of aptitude in dealing with members of Congress. A teacher secretary would face similar challenges.

AD

Field expertise is not enough; anyone in that job will need either prior understanding or a crash course in how to actually get things done in D.C. Wags will suggest that herding a room of unruly children through math lessons involves a similar skill set, and there’s some merit to that. Teachers manage, organize and lead every day.

AD

But it also seems a legitimate concern that a classroom teacher transplanted to D.C. bureaucracy would have a great deal to learn about effectively navigating the halls of power. But similar transitions have been made. Jerry Oleksiak is a 32-year classroom veteran who is now serving as Pennsylvania’s secretary of labor and industry. We often assume that lawyers and businessmen can, of course, “do government.” Why not teachers?

What most appeals about the idea is the notion of someone in the nation’s capital positioned to say, “Here’s how that policy looks in a real classroom, and here’s why it’s a lousy idea.”

AD

It’s not just that a teacher would have power, but that a teacher would actually be listened to. But that, too, is a devilish detail. A cabinet office does not come with a guarantee of access to a Presidential ear.

AD

Selecting a classroom teacher does not guarantee a particular point of view. Among the millions of classroom veterans, one finds a variety of viewpoints (one in three National Education Association members voted for Donald Trump).

It’s worth remembering that although previous secretaries include a school administrator and a college professor, the one secretary who taught in a public high school was Rod Paige, who presided over the “Texas Miracle” that turned out to be a mirage, and who once called the National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country, a “terrorist” organization (but apologized for it later the same day).

AD

Coming from a public school background is no guarantee that someone is a public school supporter.

AD

What could be the best feature of a teacher secretary would be a willingness to listen to other teachers. What has been consistently frustrating about education reform policies coming out of Washington has been how little policymakers have consulted with actual experts who work in the field. Even when teachers have been involved, they have been carefully vetted and selected to be in tune with administration ideas.

The best the next secretary could do, regardless of where she comes from, would be to assemble a broad-based panel of actual public school teachers, consult them regularly, and listen to them. In a world in which real live teachers had better access to those in power than lobbyists do, we could spend less time worrying about what the secretary of education used to do for a living."

Medical-related debt is the top reason Americans file for bankruptcy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to erase much of that debt in his latest ambitious plan to reshape the country’s health-care system.

But the way he’s proposing to do so may be logistically unworkable — and wouldn’t necessarily benefit the people who need help the most, experts say.

Over the weekend, Sanders pledged that as president he would wipe out $81 billion in past-due medical bills reported to credit agencies such as Equifax. He’s also proposing to replace private credit agencies with a government-run one that ensures medical debt never hurts people’s credit scores.

“The very concept of medical debt should not exist,” Sanders said in a statement. “In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, one illness or disease should not ruin a family’s financial life and future.”

Top Sanders aide Warren Gunnels:

The U.S is the only major country on earth where you can lose your house, car or have your wages garnished because you can't afford to pay a medical bill. That's unconscionable & unacceptable.

""This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. If we were a poor country, I'd be telling you something else."" — Nick Coltrain (@NColtrain) September 22, 2019

Sanders is right about this: Medical debt is a massive problem for Americans. That was true before the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and it remains a huge problem now.

Medical expenses are a contributing factor in two-thirds of individual bankruptcy filings. In a 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, more than a quarter of U.S. adults ages 18 to 64 said they or someone in their household had problems paying medical bills in the past year.

So it's not surprising many people hailed Sanders's proposal as a well-intentioned goal. The president of the American Federation of Teachers:

Erasing $81 billion in medical debt would certainly be good for those who owe it. But it's a lot trickier than it sounds for the government to find it, the founder of a charity that buys and sells medical debt told me. And it wouldn’t wipe out the problem — not even close.

Craig Antico leads a charity called RIP Medical Debt, which negotiates with hospitals to buy medical debt. Because so many medical bills go unpaid — and the problem has only gotten worse as insurance plans have required increasingly high deductibles from patients — he’s typically able to buy debt for just pennies on the dollar.

That’s good news for Sanders’s ambitious plan. Antico estimates that buying $81 billion in medical debt might cost as little as $500 million for the federal government.

But to buy up that debt, the government would have to figure out which hospitals are owed the $81 billion reported to credit agencies. And that information is protected by strict privacy rules credit agencies must adhere to.

“It’s definitely a worthy goal to abolish this debt,” Antico said. “It’s how do you find it?”

Antico provided an example: If the government wanted to abolish medical debt for everyone who lives in, say, New York state, it would have to go to every hospital and doctor's group that might have cared for a state resident and engage in a separate negotiation with each of them. So finding who holds the debt reported to credit agencies is harder than it sounds.

""If Bernie Sanders came to us and said 'I need you guys to abolish $81 billion in debt,' he couldn't direct it to that particular group,"" Antico said.

Plus, only a small fraction of total medical debt — less than 10 percent, according to Antico's estimates — is actually reported to credit agencies. So even if the government succeeded in erasing the $81 billion estimate, hundreds of billions more would remain. That debt would continue hurting those who owe it, as they would be less likely to visit hospitals even in dire need.

And there’s this: Targeting only medical debt reported to credit agencies carries an inherent bias toward patients who have more financial means. Patients who are poorer and could benefit more from having medical debt erased tend to have less or no credit history. Antico's charity focuses on patients who need help the most by going to hospitals and asking to buy the debt of those who might have qualified for financial assistance and didn't receive it, or those who are in bankruptcy.

Sanders didn’t go into detail about how he would approach these questions in a web page detailing his proposal. He also consistently overstates the number of people who go bankrupt every year because they can’t pay their medical bills (my Washington Post colleague Salvador Rizzo awarded Sanders three “Pinocchios” for this claim).

But Sanders’s proposal does make more sense when you consider it in light of his other health-insurance ideas. Under his Medicare-for-all plan, Americans would no longer incur medical debt because everyone would be covered under a universal plan requiring almost no out-of-pocket payments upon getting medical care.

Sanders's vision is to erase outstanding medical debt so the slate could essentially be wiped clean under a new single-payer system, said David Himmelstein, a professor at CUNY’s Hunter College. Sanders has relied on research conducted by Himmelstein, who has worked on the topic with Sanders’s Democratic rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).

“If you’re saying that we’re gonna stop having financial ruin from medical bills in the future, it makes sense to say ‘let’s go back when the cost is relatively small and not let people be ruined by their medical debts from their past,” Himmelstein told me.

Yet, like Medicare-for-all, the proposal would undoubtedly meet with strong resistance from the behemoth health-care industry. Industry lobbyists argue that erasing medical debt would discourage Americans from purchasing health insurance, because they would be sheltered from it no matter what.

“Paying off everybody’s debts is great campaign rhetoric. As soon as you get into the details, a lot of things fall apart,” one industry lobbyist told me.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

AHH: Black-market vaping products may be behind the mysterious lung illnesses that have sickened at least 530 people in 38 states and killed nine, our Washington Post colleagues Lena H. Sun and Rob Kuznia report.

“Many sick patients said they bought vape products containing THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, on the black market, officials and clinicians said,” they write. “The biggest legal marijuana market in the world is California — and the black market there is three times as big, said David Abernathy, an executive with Arcview Market Research, a cannabis investment and market research firm.”

Recent changes to the ingredients in popular marijuana vaping devices could be the culprit, according to interviews with more than a dozen people working in the legal and illegal cannabis markets. California has tightened restrictions, making the product even scarcer on the black market. So illegal operators are using a thickening agent to dilute THC oil and stretch their supplies. One such agent — vitamin E acetate — has been the focus of investigations around the mysterious illnesses.

“No one product or substance, including vitamin E acetate, has been conclusively identified as the cause of the lung injuries. But vitamin E acetate has been found in THC products taken from sickened patients and tested by state labs and the FDA’s forensic lab, officials said,” Lena and Rob add.

— Meanwhile, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told lawmakers there have been “hundreds” of new cases of the vaping-related disease reported to the agency in the past week.

CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told lawmakers on a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee that more than 100 people are working on the investigation and that the “identification of the cause or causes for the outbreak may take substantial time and continuing effort,” as CNBC’s Angelica LaVito writes.

She also suggsted people may want to avoid vaping products until more is known about what’s causing the illness.

“At this point I think caution in all products is recommended. It may not even be the THC or the nicotine. It may be the additives or substances that may be common. It may be the material is not labeled appropriately,” Schuchat said.

OOF: Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) announced the state will ban all vaping product sales for four months, the toughest state crackdown issued in response to the vaping-related illnesses.

New York and Michigan have already announced bans of flavored products, and the Trump administration said its moving to set its own regulations to “clear the market” of flavored products. Massachusetts would go a step further by also temporarily halting sales of tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes, as our Post colleague Hannah Knowles reports.

“The purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,” Baker said in a statement.

OUCH: An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found a doctor-friendly approach to tackling surprise medical billing would deepen the deficit by “double digit billions,” the Hill’s Peter Sullivan reports. The analysis specifically examined the approach from Reps. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), that calls for an arbitration system in which insurers and providers would propose payment amounts and an independent third party would determine the ""fairer"" payment option.

In an email to a congressional office, Peter writes, the CBO said under Ruiz and Roe’s approach that if “payments to providers increased by 5 percent as the result of the policy, that change alone would result in a $15 billion increase in the deficit over 10 years.”

Meanwhile, the CBO has found the bipartisan bills that advanced out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee that use a benchmarking approach would save more than $20 billion over a decade.

— The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are set to drop 14 percent in 2020 compared with 2019 and 23 percent compared with 2018. The $23 estimated average monthly premium for the plans for next year will be the lowest average monthly premium for Medicare Advantage plans since 2007, according to the agency.

The average monthly premiums for these plans have decreased by almost 30 percent since 2017. For next year, the average number of plans per county is set to increase from about 33 to 39 plans.

The agency noted more than a third of the approximately 60 million Medicare enrollees are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan and that the number of people in the program is set to increase to a record 24.4 million, up from the current 22.2 million.

In a statement, CMS Administrator Seema Verma sought to contrast the success of Medicare Advantage plans with Medicare-for-all proposals — “proposals for a total government takeover of healthcare, which would destroy options such as Medicare Advantage that seniors increasingly choose,” Verma said.

— Pharmaceutical companies are upping their lobbying efforts and spending millions on ads to try to stop drug pricing bills they worry will dull their pricing power and markedly reduce sales, the Wall Street Journal’s Peter Loftus reports.

Industry players are hoping to at least stop any proposals -- such as the effort to peg U.S. drug prices to prices paid by other countries -- from passing this year, assuming lawmakers will be less likely to advance any plans in an election year.

But the challenge for these drugmakers is their diminishing political capital as concerns about high drug prices extend across party lines.

""Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans,” Peter writes. “They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the top trade group representing the drug industry, has spent $16.3 million on lobbying in the first six months of the year, compared to $28 million for all of last year.

President Trump's congressional agenda -- and specifically, the adminstration's top economic priorities -- may be the first casualty of the impeachment inquiry House Democrats just launched.

Specifically, a reworked North American trade pact — officially the United States-Mexico-Canada deal (USMCA), the administration’s top legislative priority — and a measure to impose new price controls on prescription drugs now face even longer odds this year. And the impeachment showdown raises the stakes for a potential government shutdown in late November, when stopgap funding Trump is expected to sign this week runs out.

The confrontation between the president and the House majority promises to be consuming, leaving little bandwidth or appetite for cooperation on other matters. “Not that there’s a ton now, but there’s going to be less,” says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research for Cornerstone Macro. “It’s hard to walk and chew gum when impeachment is one of those things. I don’t think they can multitask impeachment and a legislative agenda.”

Investors drew a similar conclusion. The S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day drop in a month, sliding 0.8 percent, as did the Nasdaq. And the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.5 percent after recovering some earlier losses. It was one of the most volatile trading day in weeks, as investors reacted to gyrations on the impeachment front while also absorbing gloomy news about consumer confidence and the U.S.-China trade war.

“Investors like gridlock, but they don’t like dysfunctional paralysis,” Stephen Myrow of Beacon Policy Advisors tells me. And impeachment “is raising the specter of dysfunctional paralysis,” a dynamic that could doom the USMCA, for example, while presenting new risks, “particularly in the event of a crisis.”

House Democrats haven’t foreclosed on continuing their everyday work while the impeachment inquiry gets underway. Via the Financial Times’s James Politi:

A spokesperson for Richard Neal, House Ways and Means committee chair, says he is ""absolutely committed to continuing"" the USMCA talks, ""regardless of any other congressional activity"" — James Politi (@JamesPoliti) September 24, 2019

But White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham signaled the administration will no longer work with House Democrats on matters of common interest. “In a far departure from all of the work and results of this President, House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks,” she said in a statement.

Trump sent a similar message in a tweet:

The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

Washington analysts who help decode political developments for Wall Street investors reported a heavy volume of calls as clients attempted to make sense of the latest turmoil. Analysts said even amid rapidly moving and highly uncertain circumstances, the implications for a corporate priority such as the USMCA al are clear enough.

“From a purely market perspective, I think the impeachment conversation is being viewed as just another dynamic that will weigh on market sentiment until there is clarity on both the resolution and the longer-term implications,” Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky said in an email.

Negotiations over the trade deal had showed signs of progress in recent days. Robert Lighthizer, Trump’s trade chief, was in talks with a working group of House Democratic lawmakers appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). They were trying to forge a compromise on Democratic demands for stronger labor, environmental and enforcement provisions — changes Pelosi demanded before agreeing to put the measure to a floor vote. “Before this weekend, USMCA was looking good,” one top House Democratic aide tells me.

But revelations about Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart — and pressure the president applied for him to probe former vice president Joe Biden— reset the fall agenda. In a sign of how dramatically circumstances have shifted, some freshmen Democrats from swing districts who had been agitating for a USMCA vote in part to have a bipartisan accomplishment to tout at home became the driving force for an impeachment inquiry. Public calls from that cohort to zero in on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine dissolved Pelosi’s months-long resistance to taking the next step against the president.

""Perhaps Pelosi will schedule a vote on USMCA this year, but that strikes us as a political bridge too far,"" Cowen Washington Research Group's Chris Krueger wrote in a note. ""Ratify Trump's signature trade achievement while calling for his impeachment?""

MARKET MOVERS

— Consumer confidence falls amid trade fears: “U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in September as an escalation in trade tensions fanned concerns about business and labor market conditions, a potentially worrying signal for consumer spending, which has been driving the economy,” Reuters’s Lucia Mutikani reports.

“The relatively downbeat survey from the Conference Board ... mirrors other confidence surveys and could renew financial market fears of a recession that had been assuaged somewhat by strong August retail sales, industrial production and housing data.”

""The overall measure remains elevated,"" Bloomberg's William Edwards notes. But the drop represented the biggest slip since the beginning of the year. And it was steeper than economists expected.

— Kashkari: The Fed is partially responsible for the slowdown. The Post's Heather Long: ""Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari says two factors are holding the U.S. economy back right now: President Trump’s trade war and high interest rates. The current U.S. interest rate is a bit below 2 percent after the Fed lowered it slightly last week. Kashkari would like to see the rate cut to under 1.5 percent to stimulate the economy.

""'I’m concerned that we’ve needlessly raised interest rates over the past three years and put the economy into a more dangerous position that makes it more vulnerable to shocks that could hit us,' Kashkari told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday. 'Why are we trying to contract the economy?'""

— Boris Johnson defiant after court ruling. Bloomberg's Tim Ross and Kitty Donaldson: ""A defiant Boris Johnson hit back at the U.K.’s top judges and vowed to take the country out of the European Union next month, despite suffering an unprecedented legal defeat over his Brexit strategy in the highest court in the land. In a sweeping rebuke to the prime minister, Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson broke the law when he decided to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the EU.""

What's next: ""The ruling marks an extraordinary constitutional moment and an unprecedented political crisis for the U.K. It blows a hole in Johnson’s political authority and calls into question his ability to remain in office as the Queen’s principal adviser. Senior politicians, including the former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, demanded that he apologize to Parliament. While the opposition was quick to call for his resignation, Johnson’s aides say he won’t go.""

— Trump laces into China in U.N. speech. USA Today's John Fritze: ""Trump accused China of 'gaming' the global trade system as he defended tariffs that his critics say have put the U.S. economy at risk of a recession. He repeated long-held criticism that the World Trade Organization is giving preferential treatment to China.

""Chinese delegates sat stone-faced as Trump also briefly praised protesters in Hong Kong this year who are opposing Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. 'We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal,' Trump said. Trump said that while he wants a trade deal with China, he would 'not accept a bad deal for the American people.'""

Chinese foreign minister: ""Endless troubles"" if the countries delink. WSJ's Tyler Blint-Welsh: ""Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the so-called decoupling of the world’s two largest economies would have disastrous results and that China and the U.S. need to work cooperatively through their disagreements. Mr. Wang’s comments came as the U.S. and China remain at an impasse in a more than yearlong trade war, one that some analysts say could lead to a widening chasm between the two countries.

""'Decoupling from China’s economy would be to decouple from opportunities, and the future,' said Mr. Wang, who in the past has called the U.S.’s and China’s interests 'inseparable.'""

“The European Court of Justice ruled that Google doesn’t generally have to apply the EU’s ‘right to be forgotten’ to versions of its search engine accessed outside the bloc’s borders, though judges left the door open for European regulators to order it to do so in specific cases.”

POCKET CHANGE

— More workers to qualify for OT: “Workers making less than $35,500 are now entitled to mandatory overtime pay from their employers, under new rules announced by the Department of Labor. The new rules will take effect at the beginning of 2020,” my colleague Eli Rosenberg reports.

“The rules raise the salary threshold for workers for whom overtime pay — 1.5 times a worker’s typical hourly rate — is required from $23,600, a standard set in 2004 during the George W. Bush presidency. The Department of Labor under President Obama tried to raise the threshold to $47,000, a shift that would have given overtime pay to four million additional workers. But that proposal was met with strong opposition from business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republicans.”

— Saudis consider doubling history’s largest IPO: “After attacks on its oil infrastructure, Saudi Arabia is moving forward with the much-anticipated initial public offering of its state-owned oil company and considering a proposal to offer investors a much bigger stake in the company than previously planned, people familiar with the matter said,” the WSJ’s Summer Said and Julie Steinberg report.

“The Saudi Royal Court and its advisers have been debating an eventual float of as much as 10% of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, doubling the country’s longstanding public intention to list just 5%, according to these people. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ’s plan to expand what has already been billed as the world’s largest IPO suggests his often outsize ambitions are undeterred, even as the country’s oil giant attempts a full recovery from recent attacks on its largest facilities and faces risks to its valuation from subdued oil prices.”

— Pharma companies are ramping up their lobbying efforts: “Worried drugmakers are stepping up efforts to blunt proposals in Washington that they view as some of the most serious threats to their pricing power in recent years,” the WSJ’s Peter Loftus reports.

“Pharmaceutical industry trade organizations and outside groups are spending millions of dollars on advertisements attacking the proposals, which would peg drug prices in the U.S. to prices paid overseas and force companies to pay rebates if a drug’s price increases by more than the rate of inflation … Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans. They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

This quote: “We’re facing the stiffest political headwinds in the history of the industry,” James Greenwood, president of the trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, told the WSJ. BIO’s member companies include Amgen Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc.

— WeWork’s CEO is out: WeWork co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann ""was forced to step down and cede control of the shared-office startup after its much-anticipated initial public offering was derailed, capping a swift fall from grace for the leader of one of the country’s most valuable startups,” the WSJ’s Eliot Brown, Dana Cimilluca, David Benoit and Maureen Farrell report.

“Mr. Neumann will also cede majority control of the company, with his voting shares reduced to 3-to-1 from 10-to-1, the people said. The company earlier this month had reversed a recent enhancement to Mr. Neumann’s voting power that allotted him 20 votes for each share he held.”

The situation: “Mr. Neumann’s position at the company became tenuous after We postponed an IPO earlier this month amid concerns from prospective investors about its governance and ability to reverse big losses. That skepticism has placed a major dent in the company’s expected valuation, which has plummeted from $47 billion earlier this year to as low as $15 billion.”

— Hedge fun runs into Trump’s vaping ban: “Jason Mudrick has been enjoying a run this year that most other hedge fund managers only dream of,” Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan and Josh Saul report. “His flagship fund at Mudrick Capital Management is up 32% on soaring valuations for one of the largest players in the U.S. vaping market. Now, that same bet could pose a headache for the maverick investor.”

“About $800 million, or almost 30% of the assets overseen by his firm, are tied to E-cigarette maker NJOY Holdings Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mudrick’s controlling stake in the vaping venture has powered pretty much all of the gains in his flagship fund this year at a time when many other managers are posting tepid returns.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Sanders calls for 8% wealth tax: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ""unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes,” the New York Times’s Thomas Kaplan reports.

The details: “Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan.”

His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan.” How it compares to Warren: “... While Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.”

“... While Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.” What the money would pay for: “Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for 'Medicare for all.' ”

“Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for 'Medicare for all.' ” But Sanders made clear the effort is also meant to be punitive: ""I don’t think that billionaires should exist,” he said. “This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that’s exactly what we should be doing.”

The New York Times has this explainer comparing the various Democratic plans for taxing the wealthy.

The chief of Better Markets, which advocates for strict regulations on the finance industry, wrote with some thoughts on yesterday's note detailing the rising alarm among Wall Streeters over Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) rise in the 2020 Democratic field. He zeroed in on an CNBC report explaining how hyper-rich married couples could dodge Warren's wealth tax proposal by getting divorced: ""The Wall Street-CNBC echo chamber is dangerously out of touch,"" Kelleher wrote in an email. ""After decades of redistribution from everyone else up to the .01%, the handful of unimaginably super-wealthy Americans with $2 BILLION are going to get divorced to save $10 million in taxes! Because they are going to have a hard time making ends meet on $1,990,000,000?""

On The Hill

WHY PELOSI CHANGED HER MIND: The speaker of the House “crossed the Rubicon,” in her words, when she announced late yesterday afternoon that Democrats would officially embrace an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

It was a defining moment for Nancy Pelosi and for the Trump presidency, one which was far from guaranteed. Just a week ago, Pelosi was cautioning restive members of her caucus to hold their fire on wielding impeachment, a blunt political tool brandished only four times in American history. But the speaker relented following allegations Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.

“The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said. “Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”

Pelosi said. What this means: “Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report.

“Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report. “Unlike any other caucus meeting, there was broad consensus — I did not hear one word of dissent, and that’s the first time that I recall that’s occurred in a discussion of the president,” House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) told reporters upon exiting a caucus meeting to discuss the historic move.

The speaker's change of heart was long in coming and fed by an array of new factors:

Groundswell from Democrats in swing seats: Over 20 Democrats — many of whom sit in competitive districts won by Trump in 2016 — changed their minds and came out in support of impeachment over the last 48 hours.

An overwhelming majority: As of this morning, 198 House Democrats have called for an impeachment inquiry, according to my colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips, and Kevin Schaul.

'Most understandable': Pelosi pointed out in an interview yesterday with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg that the new allegations — unlike, perhaps, the web of complicated charges in Robert S. Mueller III's report — could be clearer to the American public, which is so far not behind impeachment.

She said: “This is about the Constitution of the United States and we have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offense in terms of the Constitution, we would say … but this one is the most understandable by the public. And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained.

And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained. The bottom line: “We don't ask foreign governments to help us in our elections,” Pelosi concluded.

The Trump factor: Unlike other controversies plaguing the Trump White House, the president himself has suggested he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden multiple times.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Sunday morning. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

“NO quid pro quo”: In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.” Key: “The president of the United States admitted that he spoke to the president of a foreign country — that would be Ukraine — about something that would assist him in his election, Pelosi told reporters, according to Politico's Kyle Cheney, Heather Caygle, and John Bresnahan. “So that has changed everything.”

Behind the scenes: Rachael, Mike and Karoun report that Pelosi and Trump spoke on Tuesday morning in a conversation in which Pelosi informed Trump of her decision to launch an impeachment inquiry.

“Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions, according to individuals familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe the conversation,” per Rachael, Mike, and Karoun.

Pelosi replied that Trump had the power to turn over the complaint and challenged him to do so: “I said, ‘Well, then undo it.’ Undo it. Because you are asking the DNI to break the law. I mean, it’s just outrageous.”

Public polling?: Voters, to this point haven't been behind an impeachment inquiry. But the impact of the fast-moving Ukraine developments haven't yet been tested, said one Democratic pollster.

Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told Power Up in an email that while he doesn't have any new numbers “they wouldn’t mean all that much now anyway — this is a quickly moving target.”

Adopted by Unanimous Consent: S.Res.325 - Transmission of Whistleblower Complaint:

NEXT STEPS: “White House and intelligence officials were working out a plan on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the whistle-blower complaint that helped ignite the impeachment drive against President Trump and to allow the whistle-blower to speak with congressional investigators, people briefed on the matter said,"" the New York Times's Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report.

“People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Schmidt, Barnes and Haberman report of the complain that was filed on Aug. 12.

Even the GOP-controlled Senate — in a rare bipartisan moment — voted unanimously for the whistleblower complaint to be turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

— in a rare bipartisan moment — voted unanimously for the whistleblower complaint to be turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The lawyers for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, released a letter to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on moving forward “to contact the congressional intelligence committees directly” to provide testimony.

“House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff said Tuesday that the lawyers had contacted the panel and testimony could be 'as soon as this week,'"" per the Associated Press.

At The White House

RUDY'S SHADOW UKRAINE AGENDA: “President Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists — including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani — to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said,” my colleagues Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima report.

“The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.”

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain.”

“Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official told my colleagues. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.”

one U.S. official told my colleagues. Read the full story here.

From the mayor: Giuliani responded to the story in a memorable appearance on Fox News last night where he claims that the State Department directed him to contact Ukrainian officials about Biden.

“I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it. And then I reported every conversation back to them. Laura, I’m a pretty good lawyer, just a country lawyer, but it’s all right here, right here. The first call from the State Department,” Giuliani told host Laura Ingraham, brandishing his cellphone to say he had proof of the contact.

How it all unfolded: Support for impeachment was not inevitable.

As our colleagues documented, the push began with the lonely Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) in 2017. Trump's actions, Mueller's Russia investigation and, finally, the whistleblower brought along successive waves of converts and increasingly a broader swath of the Democratic caucus.

Not even two years after Green's first efforts, they are now almost 200 strong.

Prior to Mueller's report being released, supporters were from some of the most liberal districts:

The redacted report's release in mid-April, Mueller's initial statement in late May and, finally, his testimony in late July began to broaden the base:

The Campaign

HOW THE 2020 CANDIDATES REACTED: Biden is not quite there yet, but he moved a lot closer toward endorsing an impeachment inquiry, our colleagues Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. report. As the early leader in the field, the former vice president’s opposition to impeachment has for months stood in stark contrast to nearly every other major 2020 hopeful --- including the nine other candidates who joined him Sept. 12 on the debate stage.

“If he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said in a brief statement from Wilmington, Del. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

The rest of the field mostly reiterated their previous calls for impeachment.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write.

“would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) wrote on Twitter, “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands.”

wrote on Twitter, “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands.” “To my former colleagues in Congress: Finish the job and impeach him,” former congressman Beto O’Rourke wrote on Twitter.

It will be interesting to watch the amount of pressure the group puts on Pelosi and House Democrats going forward. On Friday, Warren reiterated her call for impeachment that she first made in April by saying that Congress’ failure to act had made it “complicit,"" a statement that was widely viewed as a shot at Pelosi’s leadership.

The Policies

HOUSE HOLDS HEARING ON ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN: The Judiciary Committee will meet later this morning to consider the possibility of renewing the federal assault weapons ban, a controversial law passed during the 1990s that banned 19 types of semiautomatic firearms and magazines which held more than 10 rounds. But the law contained a sunset provision and Republicans were perfectly content to let it expire in 2004 --- Democrats also failed to make a serious push to renew it when they had control of Congress early in the Obama administration.

The witnesses: Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, whose city was the site of a mass shooting in August that left nine people dead; Alejandro Rios Tovar, a surgeon at the University Medical Center of El Paso, which experienced its own mass shooting just 24 hours before Dayton that left 20 people dead; and Charlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney. Dianna Muller, a former Tulsa police officer who works with a group focused on encouraging female firearm owners to tell their stories, will testify. As will Amy Swearer, a Heritage Foundation legal policy analyst who has criticized similar efforts to renew the ban.

Who's not appearing: Nobody from the NRA, which fiercely fought such legislation.

Uphill battle: Rep. David Cicilline's bill to renew the ban has 211 Democratic co-sponsors and 1 Republican, Rep. Peter King (N.Y.), supporting it. That is tantalizingly close to the necessary 218, but as CNN's Ronald Brownstein and Aaron Kessler pointed out many of the holdouts come from the majority makers that flipped Republican-leaning districts in 2018. And the GOP-controlled Senate is disinclined to action as long as Trump hasn't put his cards on the table. (The White House has still not released its promised gun-control plan.)

On The Hill

THE POINT OF NO RETURN: Pressure is mounting on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open the formal impeachment inquiry she has so long resisted.

And then there were 146: On Monday night, seven House Democrats with national security and military backgrounds who won competitive House districts in 2018 came out to back launching an impeachment inquiry — bringing the total count of Democrats in favor of opening an inquiry to 146.

In an op-ed in The Post, freshman Democratic Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia write:

“If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of “inherent contempt” and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

They are referring to allegations Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of corruption by Joe Biden and his son. Trump did so while the United States was withholding promised aid from Ukraine.

House Dem just now: “the dam is breaking” on impeachment. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

More than a majority: Pelosi, who has said impeaching Trump is “just not worth it,” is now “sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach President Trump,” multiple Democratic officials told my colleagues Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis.

“Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has asked colleagues whether they believe that Trump’s own admission that he pressured a Ukrainian leader to investigate a political foe is a tipping point,” Rachael and Mike report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night to gauge support in the caucus, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable.”

From a Pelosi ally: Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a close Pelosi ally, also has changed her tune, writing in a statement that an impeachment inquiry “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable.

“Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she tweeted.

On today's docket: Pelosi has summoned House leaders to a 4 p.m. meeting to discuss the matter.

“Mindful that Democrats may have only a brief window to decide their course, [Pelosi] summoned the leaders of six House committees involved in investigations of the president to meet on Tuesday, telling the lawmakers to come without aides. Afterward, she planned to convene a special meeting of the Democratic caucus to discuss impeachment,” the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, Nick Fandos, Michael Crowley and Ken Vogel report. A full meeting of the Democratic caucus will take place afterward.

Rachael and Mike report that House leadership has discussed “the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence” to handle a hypothetical impeachment inquiry.

In the meantime though, Pelosi still faces some political obstacles:

“Voters still overwhelming disapprove of Democrats impeaching the president — though those polls where conducted before last week’s reports about the whistleblower complaint. In the Senate, Republicans have made it clear that they are standing with Trump and are unlikely to convict him if a trial occurs,” per Rachael and Mike.

But Trump seems impervious to the growing political firestorm — indeed, he appeared to be stoking it yesterday with incendiary comments targeting Biden at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York.

“What he’s learned is you can get away with just about anything if you’re willing to gamble and you have zero shame,” Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, told the New York Times's Peter Baker. “He had just outbluffed the old-school way of holding people to account, so what the heck, why not go for it in the phone call to the new, young and vulnerable Ukrainian president?”

“It’s difficult to imagine a purer example, even on the president’s own account of his conduct, of why the Constitution’s framers thought it essential to include the impeachment power,” Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told Baker.

At The White House

THE FACTS ARE COMING OUT: As the White House refuses to release the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky, reporters unearthed important details fueling suspicions Trump may have sought to leverage and withhold congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.

The latest: “President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials,” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig.

“Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had 'concerns' and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.”

Key: “Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an 'interagency process' but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11,” per Karoun, Josh, Ellen and Carol.

'A perfect phone call': That's how Trump has described the July phoner with Ukraine's president. But Zelensky spoke with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) during an early September visit to Ukraine and “'directly' expressed concerns at their meeting that 'the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence' of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens,” per our colleagues.

Trump took his attacks on Biden and the press to a whole new level:

“If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair right now,” Trump told reporters on Monday from a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.

DNC RAISES DEBATE THRESHOLDS: “The Democratic National Committee announced new qualification rules for the November debates,” our colleague Michael Scherer writes of the decision “that could kick more candidates off the stage, as party leaders continue to push to shrink the field in the presidential nomination fight.”

Some of the questions he's answered so far: ""What does he think about growing calls for an impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump?"" Rodriguez writes. ""Did he have a comment on the Republican Party's talking points about the presidential race? How does he assess the current psyche of American voters? What does he miss about home?

In the Media

THIS BOMBSHELL STORY FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHER: A.G. Sulzberger, the Times publisher, spoke at Brown University about the state of journalism. He discussed for the first time a story that shows how much the Trump administration “has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press.” It is simply jaw-dropping.

You can read the full-text of his speech here.

What happened: “Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh,” Sulzberger said. “Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.”

Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.” But this time was different: “We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said.

Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said. Luckily, they figured out another way: “Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help,” Sulzberger said. “Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him. We hate to imagine what would have happened had that brave official not risked their career to alert us to the threat.”

THE BIG IDEA: If President Trump thought releasing the readout of his call with Ukraine’s president would break impeachment fever on Capitol Hill, he miscalculated.

The five-page summary released this morning intensified Democratic demands to see the entire whistleblower complaint. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a member of Democratic leadership, said the president asking for Ukraine’s help to undermine his 2020 challenger is “a textbook abuse of power.” At a news conference, he said “the transcripts become exhibit A.”

According to the rough transcript, Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the conduct of Joe Biden and offered to meet with the new president at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said, according to the transcript, after asking for ""a favor."" (Here are seven additional takeaways, via Aaron Blake.)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged fellow party leaders in a private meeting to keep the impeachment investigation narrowly focused on Trump and his dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart, per Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade.

Several Senate Republicans were stunned and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released the rough transcript, Robert Costa reports. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters after reading the transcript.

-- “Senior Justice Department officials said the director of national intelligence referred the concerns about the call to the Justice Department, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws that ban people from soliciting contributions from foreign sources. The inspector general later also referred the matter to the FBI,” Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report. “Career prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department’s criminal division then reviewed the transcript of the call, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts ‘could not make out and cannot make out’ the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be considered ‘a thing of value’ under the law.”

-- What was released by the White House is a five-page summary of a 30-minute conversation. That means some of what was covered is likely not even in the memo. The document includes a disclaimer on the first page that it is “not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.”

“The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,” it says. “A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.”

-- Richard Nixon released a transcript, too. After the revelation that he recorded Oval Office meetings, the then-president refused to turn over the tapes, claiming executive privilege, and fought subpoenas in court. Eventually, trying to quell a political firestorm, he offered transcripts – which he personally edited – and insisted they exonerated him. “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said in April 1974. Months later, when House investigators listened to some of the audio, it turned out there were significant discrepancies and key phrases missing. Ever since Nixon resigned, the White House has, perhaps understandably, generally avoided recording presidential phone calls. That tradition explains why there’s apparently no recording on the American side of Trump’s July conversation.

-- Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill made clear even before the summary came out that the summary will not be enough to deter them from moving ahead with the impeachment inquiry. They argue that Trump does not need to have explicitly linked U.S. financial assistance to a Biden investigation for the call to represent a clear-cut abuse of power. “There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,” Pelosi said during a live event for the Atlantic. “You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. … I don't think there's a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) says the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown and is entitled to legal protections, wants to speak to members of his committee and has formally sought guidance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire about how he could do so. “We’re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff tweeted. Lawyers for the whistleblower confirmed this.

-- The Senate passed a resolution last night, by unanimous consent and with no Republican objections, calling for the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required by law. The House plans to vote later today on a resolution condemning the administration’s refusal to provide the complaint. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to sit down with the Ukrainian president later today at the U.N. General Assembly. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify in open session tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee and then in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

-- Pelosi personally informed Trump of her decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in a Tuesday morning phone call. “The president, in New York for the U.N. meeting, telephoned the speaker to discuss gun legislation, Pelosi told lawmakers in private meetings,” per Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. “The conversation, however, quickly turned to the president’s conversations with the Ukrainian leader. Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions … Trump told Pelosi that he wasn’t the one blocking the complaint. … She responded that he had the power to fix it and challenged him to turn over the complaint.”

-- The New York Times reports that White House and intelligence officials are trying to hash out a plan to release a redacted version of the whistleblower report in a bid to quell calls for impeachment and sow Democratic divisions on the best path forward: “People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report. “The appearance that they were stonewalling Congress, in their view, could prove more damaging than the whistle-blower’s account. Mr. Trump also believes that the allegations about him are not nearly as damning as they have been portrayed and that disclosing them will undercut the impeachment drive, people close to the president said.”

-- A senior administration official told Politico that the White House is “preparing” to give Congress both the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general’s report by the end of this week. “The administration official stressed the decision and timing could change over the next few days,” Nancy Cook reports. “The format of presentation, or process of viewing the documents, wasn't decided. The president has agreed to the move, the official added.”

-- Even though the whistleblower complaint focused on the Trump call with Zelensky, officials familiar with its contents say that it includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations. “Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official said. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.” That anonymous quote comes from a story that posted last night by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima.

“Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists … to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev,” they report. “The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain. As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with [Zelensky] out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race …

“U.S. officials described an atmosphere of intense pressure inside the NSC and other departments since the existence of the whistleblower complaint became known, with some officials facing suspicion that they had a hand either in the complaint or in relaying damaging information to the whistleblower … One official — speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity — described the climate as verging on ‘bloodletting.’ … Trump has fanned this dynamic with his own denunciations of the whistleblower and thinly veiled suggestions that the person should be outed. … Trump’s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was ordered by Trump to suspend the aid to Ukraine, are also increasingly targets of internal finger-pointing. Mulvaney has agitated for foreign aid to be cut universally but has also stayed away from meetings with Giuliani and Trump …

“Then-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression … But by then his standing with Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Giuliani’s agenda or authority … Giuliani told The Post that one of his calls with a top Ukrainian aide was partially arranged by Kurt Volker, a State Department official, and that he briefed the department afterward. ‘We had the same visibility as anybody else — watching Giuliani on television,’ a former senior official said. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Giuliani was a designated representative.”

-- Giuliani had an outburst on Fox News last night when a fellow panelist was talking over him. “Shut up, moron,” Giuliani shouted on “The Ingraham Angle,” yelling at liberal radio host Christopher Hahn. “Shut up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” (Allyson Chiu)

DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS REMAIN OVER IMPEACHMENT:

-- Pelosi’s declaration left unsettled key questions about how that investigation will unfold. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore some of them: “How sweeping will the probe be? How long will it last? Who will conduct it? And will Pelosi’s unilateral pronouncement — which was delivered with no immediate plans to ratify it with a House vote — do anything to change the course of existing investigations that have hit a stone wall of White House resistance? … The lack of detail about the road ahead, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, reflected both the speed with which once-wavering Democrats unified behind a formal impeachment probe — and the continuing divisions among them on how it should be conducted. …

“[T]he House Judiciary Committee will continue playing the lead role in the proceedings, despite the desire of some Democrats to involve a broader swath of lawmakers and to at least partly sideline Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel’s fervently pro-impeachment chairman. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s announcement, Pelosi explored potentially establishing a special ‘select’ committee, with members handpicked by House leaders, but backed away from that idea after the dispute generated protests from liberals and threatened to divide the caucus along ideological lines. … The past two presidential impeachment processes, involving [Nixon] and Bill Clinton, included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate. There are no plans for such a vote now … That is a question likely to be litigated in the courts. …

“Meanwhile, an even more fundamental dispute lingered — one that may not be resolved any time soon. Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry … and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by [Mueller], episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry. More than 30 Democratic lawmakers announced support for impeachment just this week, many of them Democratic ‘frontliners’ in vulnerable districts who said that the Ukraine allegations prompted them to speak out. … ‘This should be a very distinct procedure relative to this allegation, rather than the whole basket,’ said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a freshman who backed impeachment proceedings Monday after months of resisting pressure to take that step.

“But Pelosi’s involvement of other committees besides the Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence panels with direct jurisdiction over the Ukraine matter suggest the impeachment brief could go much wider. The Financial Services Committee, for instance, is probing Trump’s real estate dealings; the Ways and Means Committee is seeking Trump’s tax returns; and the Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating whether Trump is using the presidency for self-enrichment. ‘I see the most recent issue as one issue among many issues,’ said Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who has pushed for Trump’s impeachment for two years, forcing multiple unsuccessful votes on removing Trump over alleged instances of bigotry.”

-- Our latest whip count: 198 House Democrats now publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry. That includes 22 of the 24 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. Fifty-seven Democrats endorsed proceedings in a period of 24 hours:

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democrats have crossed the Rubicon, and nobody really knows where it will lead. “I can’t tell you what will come from this. I don’t think anybody can,” said Dan Sena, who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. “But it is definitely going to be an X-factor going into the 2020 election.” Michael Scherer talked to several other political professionals:

Democratic strategists hope the fact pattern behind Trump’s communications with Ukraine is far more direct and damning than the complex stories of potential obstruction contained in Bob Mueller's report: “This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened.""

“This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened."" GOP strategists hope impeachment would gin up their voters in 2020: “There is nothing that will do more for Republican turnout than this. And the last couple of presidential elections have all been turnout elections,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster working on the Trump reelection effort.

-- A Quinnipiac poll that was in the field from this past Thursday through Monday found that 57 percent of voters believe Trump should not be impeached. John Wagner reports: “Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”

-- This explains why many moderate Democrats still remain cautious. For example, Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) – who picked up a Republican seat in the Kansas City suburbs last year – expressed support for Pelosi’s pronouncement last night but carefully avoided using the word “impeachment” in her statement. (K.C. Star)

-- Biden is mostly alone in the Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry. Speaking in Delaware, the former vice president called on Congress to begin proceedings if the White House continues stalling lawmakers' investigations. ""Biden, who spoke for several minutes and left without taking questions, said that if Trump doesn’t comply with Congress, it will be forced to begin impeachment hearings,"" Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve Wootson Jr. report:

Bernie Sanders would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment come before the Senate, saying he wants to review evidence before making a decision. He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa.

He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa. Elizabeth Warren said proceedings must begin now.

said proceedings must begin now. Pete Buttigieg , who has been more cautious on the question, said Trump “has made it clear he deserves to be impeached.”

, who has been more cautious on the question, said Trump “has made it clear he deserves to be impeached.” Beto O’Rourke called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.”

called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.” Hillary Clinton also changed her mind, saying she’s now in favor of moving toward impeachment of a president she described as a “corrupt human tornado.” “I did not come to that decision easily or quickly,” she said, “but this is an emergency as I see it.”

-- The impeachment debate will effectively freeze the 2020 campaign, predicts ABC News political director Rick Klein: “It would all play out against an inconvenient political timeline, with hearings in the House and a potential trial in the Senate almost certainly extending well into the winter. That's the precise time that campaigning is most intense, with primary voting beginning in February. For the six senators and two sitting House members running for president, that could make for far more time spent at the day job in Washington than anticipated. Long-developed plans for policy rollouts and potential breakout moments could wind up subsumed by the news.""

-- The Trump reelection campaign immediately tried to turn the impeachment inquiry into a fundraising opportunity. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “Emails, texts, tweets and a video directed his supporters to a new Republican portal designed to capi­tal­ize on Trump’s army of online donors. ‘The Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU, Friend. They want to take YOUR VOTE away,’ read an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon. ‘President Trump wants to know who stood with him when it mattered most.’ … The appeals on Tuesday called on his supporters to join an ‘Official Impeachment Defense Task Force’ made up of ‘only President Trump’s most LOYAL supporters,’ with suggested donations ranging from $5 to the maximum $2,800, or $45 to show support for the 45th president.”

-- In public, Trumpworld is making the impeachment inquiry look like white noise. But in private, White House aides and allies are starting to feel anxious. Politico reports: “Few in the White House or the wider Trump orbit have privately defended Trump’s call … ‘The president’s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,’ said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. … The White House is betting Trump can ride out this ‘outrage du jour,’ as one senior administration official called it, and move on just as he has skated through the … dozens of other threats to his presidency. … But current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego — and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.”

-- The world is reacting warily to the specter of impeachment. Rick Noack and David Crawshaw report: Some experts said it “would have little effect on hot-button issues such as the trade dispute with China or his promises on Brexit, while others predicted that increased domestic pressure would force Trump to seek a quick foreign-policy breakthrough… The developments weighed on financial markets, already hit by concerns about global economic weakness and the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.”

COMMENTARY:

-- “I’m a Republican. Let’s force the question of impeachment with the GOP,” writes veteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy: “In the wake of the president’s actions on Ukraine, the Republican Party and the officials who lead it must be brutally marked to market on the issue of Trump’s fitness for office. This test would create an existential question for every Republican senator and representative: Why am I here? To serve my future or my country?”

-- “This isn’t just another spat. Trump compromised our security for his gain,” writes columnist David Ignatius: “Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country. … Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are.”

-- “If we legitimize Trump’s behavior, it will be open season on our politics,” writes columnist Robert Kagan: “Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents … Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.”

-- “Republicans (who decided perjury about sex was impeachment-worthy, and who thought it an abuse of power to defer deportations of certain illegal immigrants) must now decide whether to accept Trump’s standard as proper for future presidents,” writes columnist Dana Milbank.

-- Conservative columnist Max Boot identifies seven reasons why he thinks Trump should be impeached:

He obstructed the administration of justice.

He failed to defend America from foreign election interference.

He attempted to investigate and prosecute his political opponents.

He failed to produce papers and testimony as duly directed by Congress.

He conspired with Michael Cohen to conceal alleged extramarital relationships.

He misused his emergency powers to spend funds on a border wall.

He retains ownership of a global business empire, which allows him to benefit from dealings with foreign and state governments.

-- But Biden sill could wind up being the principal casualty, Pat Buchanan writes, hopefully, in the New Hampshire Union Leader: “Calls are rising for Biden’s son to be called to testify before congressional committees. ... The charges and the countercharges will become what the campaign is all about.""

-- Democrats are upholding a double standard on Ukraine, chimes in conservative columnist Marc Thiessen.

-- Impeaching Trump could hurt the institution of the presidency, worries John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration: “If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.”

-- We should talk about how Ukrainians feel about this, says Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, in the Times: “Ukraine remains in a precarious position. Crimea is still under Russian control, and the war in the east continues; the fight against corruption at home is also not yet won. In all of these matters, Ukraine is reliant on bipartisan American support, which is why our leadership is desperate to avoid becoming part of the American presidential campaign. Ukraine is now facing the prospect of becoming a double victim: on the one hand, a victim of [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression; on the other, a victim of Mr. Trump’s desire to be re-elected at any price.”

-- The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board calls this the Impeachment Congress: “Mr. Trump’s invitation to Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden, if that’s what it was, showed bad judgment in our view … But bad judgment is not a crime, and voters may demand more to annul an election only months before they have a chance to render their own judgment about Mr. Trump’s behavior.""

-- Pelosi’s patience on impeachment has paid off, so far, CNN’s Michael Warren writes: “Democrats have now created the appearance that impeachment of Trump is a last resort, not a first resort. She divorced the process from the mess of the Mueller findings. And she allowed those moderate freshmen who built her majority, rather than the divisive members on the left, to lead on the issue.”

-- “Pelosi has to hope for the worst case for Trump,"" writes National Review executive editor Rich Lowry, ""because it’s going to be difficult to climb down from impeachment now.""

-- Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume believes Pelosi has handled this cleverly: “It strikes me that the Speaker and the other leaders are under pressure from the left wing of the party and the leftists in their caucus -- who are numerous -- to move ahead here … I think [she’s] thinking that she needs to be responsive to the needs of her caucus -- look at what she did today, it was really quite clever if you think about it.”

Bijan Rafiekian leaves a court hearing last year in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

THERE’S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- A judge overturned a jury's verdict convicting Michael Flynn’s former business partner of illegally lobbying for Turkey, saying the evidence against him was “insufficient.” Rachel Weiner reports: “'The verdict was against the heavy weight of the evidence,’ Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote in a 39-page opinion tossing Bijan Rafiekian’s convictions. The decision is another blow to efforts by the Justice Department to crack down on unregistered lobbying for foreign governments. … Trenga pointed to the fact that Flynn was not charged or implicated by prosecutors until the eve of trial as ‘particularly telling.’”

-- Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic power broker, and Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman, said they were notified on Monday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had closed the inquiry into work they did that benefited Ukrainian interests. It’s another reflection of the challenges facing prosecutors attempting to more aggressively pursue possible violations of foreign lobbying rules, Tom Hamburger and Matt Zapotosky report: “The decision to drop the investigation came weeks after a federal jury in Washington found former White House counsel Gregory B. Craig not guilty of lying to the Justice Department about his media contacts related to his work for the Ukrainian government. …

""Weber and Podesta were among several lobbyists and lawyers that (Paul) Manafort helped bring aboard as part of an effort to improve the image of the Ukrainian government between 2012 and 2014, according to Mueller’s report. Mueller ultimately referred the case involving the two men to federal prosecutors in New York. ... As the investigation proceeded, Podesta closed his iconic lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, in the fall of 2017. Weber left Mercury, a firm he had helped lead since 2011, in August.”

-- A federal judge rejected former Trump confidant Roger Stone’s request to suppress all evidence gathered through 18 search warrants at his November trial. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Attorneys for Stone had argued that prosecutors illegally relied on unproven assumptions about Russia’s involvement and sought to force them to prove in court the role of Russian operatives in hacks on the Democratic National Committee and [Clinton’s] presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone had ‘not come close’ to showing the government misled the magistrates or judges who approved the warrants, that federal agents knowingly or intentionally lied to them or that the warrants were premised on Russia’s role in the hacking.”

Students line up for school lunches at an elementary school in Canton, Miss. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- A new Trump administration proposal to limit the number of people who qualify for food stamps could end free school lunches for about 500,000 American children. Moriah Balingit reports: “The change, proposed over the summer, would cut an estimated 3 million people from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. It is intended to eliminate eligibility for people who get food stamps because they have qualified for other forms of government aid, even though they may have savings or other assets. But the impact of the cuts is anticipated to go further: Children in those households could also lose access to free school lunches, since food stamp eligibility is one way students can qualify for the lunches.”

-- NASA is trying to land on the moon, and its biggest obstacle might be Congress. Christian Davenport reports: NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is seeking “votes in Congress for what could become one of the boldest human exploration endeavors NASA has undertaken in decades — the first return to the moon since the end of the Apollo era. … Bridenstine knows that before NASA builds the rockets, spacecraft and lunar landers needed for the mission, the agency must clear the political roadblocks that are every bit as daunting as the vacuum of space. While members of Congress love to say they support NASA — as they do lowering crime or boosting national security — getting them to increase the agency’s budget is another story. Traditionally, space does not equal votes in elections. And getting Democrats to support a project that, if successful, could be a legacy for the Trump administration is going to be a tough sell.”

-- The administration has granted few waivers to visitors blocked from entering the U.S. by the travel ban Trump imposed days after taking office, with officers arguing that people from five predominantly Muslim countries continue to pose a national security threat. Abigail Haulsohner reports: “Since the initial rollout, in early 2017, of what critics and federal judges have branded a ‘Muslim ban,’ the Trump administration has fielded approximately 72,000 visa applications from the citizens of Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, a U.S. State Department official told members of Congress on Tuesday. Approximately 10 percent of those applicants — 7,679 — have received waivers to enter the United States, according to Edward Ramotowski, deputy assistant secretary for visa services at the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, who testified during a House judiciary and foreign affairs subcommittee hearing.”

-- The chief executive of Juul Labs is stepping down amid outrage over the soaring use of teenage vaping. From the Times: “The executive, Kevin Burns, will be replaced by K.C. Croswaite, an executive from Altria, the major tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in Juul, the San-Francisco-based company. Juul also said it would end one of its campaigns, ‘Make the Switch,’ which the Food and Drug Administration had criticized as an effort to portray its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. The company also said it would not fight the Trump administration’s proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.”

-- Massachusetts will place a four-month ban on all sales of vaping products, the toughest state crackdown on e-cigarettes so far. Hannah Knowles reports: “Bans on sales of flavored vaping products took effect this month in New York and Michigan, and the Trump administration said it plans to enact a similar regulation at the federal level. Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine. But Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that’s expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

-- California health officials called on everyone to stop vaping immediately, per the Los Angeles Times: “‘We are seeing something that we have not seen before,’ said Dr. Charity Dean, California’s acting public health officer, in a statement. ‘There are numerous unknown factors at this time, and due to the uncertainty of the exact cause, it is our recommendation that consumers refrain from vaping until the investigation has concluded.’”

-- House Republicans are seriously considering relaxing term limits for committee chairmen. From Politico: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of changing the GOP’s long-standing rule that allows members to be the top Republican on a committee for only three terms, regardless of whether they serve in the majority or minority. One idea that was suggested, according to multiple Republican sources who attended the meeting, is allowing a lawmaker’s term as ranking member to not count the same as a chairmanship.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- A new United Nations climate report finds that massive change is already here for the world’s oceans and frozen regions. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Wednesday’s report on the world’s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects only foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked. Given current emissions levels, a number of serious impacts are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Extreme floods that have historically struck some coastal cities and small island nations once every 100 years will become an annual occurrence by 2050, according to the IPCC. In addition, if emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century — around 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries. … More than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report...""

-- A glacier on Mont Blanc could collapse. From the BBC: “About 250,000 cubic metres of ice are in danger of breaking away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak ... The mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur said global warming was changing the mountain. … The glacier, in the Glarus Alps, has shrunk to a tiny fraction of its original size. Scientists say it has lost at least 80% of its volume just since 2006, a trend accelerated by rising global temperatures.”

-- The Trump administration declared there’s no “international right to abortion” during the U.N. General Assembly, calling on other countries to join a coalition pushing the elimination of what it calls “ambiguous” terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health, from U.N. documents. Ariana Eunjung Cha reports: “Earlier this year, HHS officials began meeting with representatives from other countries, urging them to join a new international coalition that would focus on the value of the family, and which would not condone harmful sexual risks for young people, or promote abortion as a means of family planning.

“Other countries, civil society and women’s rights groups have expressed alarm at the efforts and accused the United States of aligning with countries like Saudi Arabia and Sudan with poor human rights records and, also, of putting unfair pressure on poor countries that depend on U.S. aid.""

-- Trump condemned globalism during his address to the General Assembly. Anne Gearan and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump read his address in a somber monotone, rarely punctuating words or pausing for emphasis, but his message for the 74th session of the annual gathering of world leaders was clear as he argued that a view of the world as a global commons had ‘exerted a religious pull over past leaders’ at the expense of their own nations. … In his 37-minute address, Trump stressed that all nations must take care of themselves first while adding that the United States would get involved abroad only when its own interests were threatened. He also used his platform Tuesday to take a hard line against Iran...""

-- Trump also heaped praise on Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi during UNGA. At home, Sissi faces mass protests to step down from human rights activists. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “When asked Monday whether he was concerned about the anti-Sissi demonstrations, Trump shrugged the suggestion aside. ‘Demonstrations? No, everybody has demonstrations,’ he told reporters ... ‘Egypt has a great leader. He’s highly respected; he’s brought order. Before he was here, there was very little order. There was chaos. So I’m not worried about that.’ … Trump and Sissi’s meeting Monday came just days after viral videos from a former government contractor alleging Sissi was complicit in a large-scale corruption scandal provoked protests in Egypt.

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the Amazon isn’t on fire, rejecting calls for foreign intervention. Marina Lopes reports: “The Amazon isn’t in flames, he told [UNGA] in New York, but brimming with riches. And Brazil will decide how to develop it. ‘We are open to explore our potential in a sustainable way, through partnerships that add value,’ Bolsonaro said. It was his first address on the world stage since the worst fires in a decade hit the Amazon this year. In a speech peppered with references to God, socialism and patriotism, he said foreign powers with an eye on Brazil’s natural riches ‘have an interest in keeping indigenous people living like cave men.’”

-- Venezuela’s ex-intelligence chief said he told President Nicolás Maduro about Colombian guerrilla camps in Venezuela. Anthony Faiola reports: Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figueroa said he hand-delivered reports including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil. “‘They never took action,’ he said. ‘You could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.’ Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia’s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. … The classified report ... offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro’s personal knowledge of the guerrillas’ presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating. “

-- Hong Kong police are waging a war on facts as protests on the island continue. David Crawshaw and Timothy McLaughlin report: “The ‘yellow object’ lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the video footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of it was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts. As Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, it appeared to squirm. … With Beijing asserting increasing control over the city’s institutions and Hong Kong’s leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, authorities here appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law. Instead, their approach this week was to obfuscate. Asked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an ‘officer kicking a yellow object,’ not a man lying on the ground.”

Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), center, celebrates after being sworn in by Nancy Pelosi in January. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

THE BIG IDEA: Several House Democrats facing tough reelection fights next year in districts that Donald Trump carried in 2016 are expressing openness to impeachment for the first time, a major tipping point that reflects their palpable outrage over the president’s purported conduct toward Ukraine and will intensify pressure on their colleagues who hold safer seats to follow suit.

The latest is freshman Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. She picked up an open seat in the Detroit suburbs last fall that Republicans had held for decades. Trump won the district three years ago by 4.4 percentage points. In a statement sent after 7 a.m., Stevens said she did not get to this point lightly – “but rather out of a sober obligation to stand up for the rule of law and our national security.”

“Over the last several days, I have been deeply alarmed by reports of serious abuse of power by President Trump,” Stevens wrote. “The President is alleged to have used the power of his office to pressure a foreign head of state for his own personal political gain. Furthermore, the Director of National Intelligence continues to illegally withhold information about this matter from Congress. If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Stevens’s announcement follows a new Washington Post report that Trump ordered his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which the president is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden’s son. That’s according to three senior administration officials.

Trump confirmed this morning at the United Nations that he withheld military aid from Ukraine but insisted that he did so because he wanted other European countries to chip in. “But very importantly, Germany, France, other countries should put up money, and that’s been my complaint from the beginning,” the president told reporters at the United Nations.

We’ve been hearing lots of metaphors from plugged-in Democratic strategists we’ve spoken with over the past 24 hours like “the dam is breaking” and “the train is leaving the station.” Or, as Democratic pollster Geoff Garin put it, “The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up.”

Stevens is the third Michigan congresswoman to express support for moving toward an impeachment inquiry in a period of just 12 hours. As of 10 a.m., 148 House Democrats have now publicly expressed support for at least opening an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” (Follow our running whip count here.)

Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who represents a district that Trump carried by 6.7 points in 2016, which stretches from the northern Detroit suburbs to the state capital in Lansing, submitted an op-ed to The Washington Post last night with six other House freshmen who have extensive national security experience. They agreed that, if the allegations against Trump are true, “we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” And they’re calling on their colleagues to use all congressional authorities, including impeachment hearings, to “address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

Slotkin, who toppled Republican incumbent Mike Bishop in the midterms, is a former CIA officer who was personally involved in briefings for both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Fluent in Arabic, she was a Middle East analyst for the agency and deployed to Iraq for three tours over five years. Then she became the director for Iraq policy on the National Security Council, moved to the State Department and finally the Pentagon. (I profiled her in a 2017 Big Idea.)

The other signatories are Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. “We have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country, and throughout our careers, we have sworn oaths to defend the Constitution of the United States many times over. Now, we join as a unified group to uphold that oath as we enter uncharted waters and face unprecedented allegations against President Trump,” the seven wrote. (One of the members, Crow from the Denver suburbs, endorsed impeachment in July. But the others had all previously held off.)

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), the widow of the legendary John Dingell, has her finger on the pulse of the caucus better than all but a handful of her colleagues. She’s been exceedingly cautious on impeachment – arguing that it would “tear the country apart” – until last night. “This country is divided. We cannot be divided on the rule of law. As an elected official my oath is to protect national security and the Constitution,” she tweeted at 10:22 p.m. “After recent revelations, I support an impeachment inquiry because we must follow the facts and hold the President accountable.”

Because of Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from the other side of Michigan who left the GOP on July 4 after endorsing impeachment, Democrats can afford to lose 18 or so votes and still pass any article of impeachment. Republicans who control the Senate would then most likely acquit Trump during an ensuing trial in that body. Nancy Pelosi, though, wants something as close to unanimity in her caucus as possible and she’s been afraid to endanger her front-line members like Stevens.

Many prominent impeachment skeptics in the Democratic caucus have been friends and loyalists of the speaker who hold solidly blue seats but defer to her political judgment. That’s why it’s a huge deal that Pelosi loyalists have moved toward impeachment over the past 24 hours. The most prominent of these is Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.

In a lengthy statement last night, she said Trump’s “reckless abuse of power” is a “turning point.” She explained that her thinking changed and impeachment “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable. “Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she wrote.

Anyone who knows DeLauro knows she doesn’t put that statement out before checking with Pelosi. And another member from Connecticut who is close to Pelosi, Rep. John Larson of the Hartford area, piled on, as well. “The Director of National Intelligence must comply with the law on Thursday,” he tweeted. “If not, the Trump Administration has left Congress with no alternative but for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, which I will support.”

-- Thursday is shaping up to be a huge day on Capitol Hill. Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in open session on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee and in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Pelosi has given the administration until Thursday to turn over the whistleblower’s complaint, which set in motion this firestorm. Under federal law, any matter deemed of “urgent concern” by the inspector general – which this has been – is supposed to be shared with Congress. But the Trump administration is refusing to comply with that legal requirement.

Separately, three House Democratic chairmen threatened to subpoena documents pertaining to Ukraine that the administration has thus far declined to voluntarily hand over if they don’t get answers by Thursday. In a joint statement, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (N.Y.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (Md.) gave Mike Pompeo until then to let their panels know if he intends to comply with a request they sent to the State Department two weeks ago.

-- More on the internal power dynamics: “Pelosi has been quietly sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach,” Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. … [A]n official familiar with her thinking warned that just because she was considering impeachment didn’t mean it would happen right away. …

“Senior Democratic officials cautioned that no steps have been finalized, and there were still questions about timing and how to conduct the proceedings. Some Democrats, for example, want [Schiff] to have a role in whatever impeachment process moves ahead. Democratic leaders are also discussing the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence. …

“In the meantime, House leaders are planning to hold a vote on a resolution to either condemn Trump’s actions or express the sense of the House that the administration turn over the whistleblower complaint, a move liberals are already dismissing as insufficient. The language has not been finalized. … Impeachment dominated a meeting of chiefs of staff for lawmakers in competitive districts on Monday … [T]he session grew heated and angry, pitting those congressional aides who thought it was time to back impeachment against those who worry about the political fallout.”

-- Just as DeLauro and Larson came out in tandem, many other House Democrats have taken the impeachment plunge in pairs. I wrote in July about how both House members from New Hampshire endorsed an impeachment inquiry on the same afternoon. It happened again Monday in Minnesota. Two moderate Democrats from suburban districts in the Twin Cities, who both defeated Republican incumbents last year, issued strongly worded statements: Dean Phillips and Angie Craig.

-- Fresh details continue to trickle out about Trump’s role in freezing the money appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against a revanchist Russia: “Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July,” per Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig. “They explained that the president had ‘concerns’ and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent. Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an ‘interagency process’ but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11. … There was concern within the administration that if they did not spend the money, they would run afoul of the law … Trump on Monday repeated his denial of doing anything improper …

“Trump’s allies have frequently said he has been better about distributing military aid, and specifically lethal aid, to Ukraine than his predecessor. Yet according to Democratic and Republican aides, no administration has withheld funds as long and as mysteriously as the Trump administration did this year since the United States began helping Ukraine fend off Russian-backed separatists in the country’s eastern provinces. …Withholding aid from foreign governments is something the president has frequently requested, such as with Central American countries when he said they were not doing their part to help the United States with immigrants amassing at the southern border. …

“Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted to release the money to Ukraine because he thought it would help the country while curtailing Russian aggression. But Trump has said he was primarily concerned with corruption. … Besides Bolton, several other administration officials said they did not know why the aid was being canceled or why a meeting was not being scheduled.”

MORE ON THE L’AFFAIRE UKRAINE:

-- Senate Republicans mostly dodged and deflected questions about the whistleblower complaint. Felicia Sonmez, DeBonis and Erica Werner report: “So far only one Republican in the Senate, Mitt Romney of Utah, has voiced concern about the president’s alleged actions … As they returned to the Senate on Monday, most Republicans instead dodged questions about the whistleblower complaint or said that it is an issue for the Senate Intelligence Committee to address. Some, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), cast doubt on the allegations against Trump. … Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) disputed the use of the word ‘whistleblower’ to describe the person who revealed Trump’s phone call with (Volodymyr) Zelensky. … Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) mainly kept his focus on Biden, but he also suggested that Trump should release more details about his call with Zelensky. …

“Even Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), co-founder of the bipartisan Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, steered clear of addressing the allegations directly. In a statement, Grassley chided Democrats and the media for ‘rampant speculation’ but made no mention of Trump. … Later, in an exchange with reporters, Grassley declined to say whether he believes it is appropriate that Trump brought up Biden in his phone call with Zelensky.

“Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, said he believes Trump was wrong to have raised Biden in his call with Zelensky. But he dismissed calls for the president’s impeachment and said that so far no evidence has emerged of a quid pro quo offer by Trump of military aid in exchange for investigating Biden. ‘He simply raised the issue of Biden, and I don’t believe he should have done it,’ Rubio said. ‘But that in and of itself is not an impeachable offense, as some people claim. Now, the second thing you raise, [a quid pro quo], he denies, and so do the Ukrainians. If alternative information emerges, we have a different set of circumstances, but that’s not before us right now.’”

-- A counterpoint: “I think this is the most serious charge against the president, far more serious than what Bob Mueller dug or dragged up against him,” said Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano. “If you are the President of the United States and you are making a conversation that you know your intelligence community is listening to, of course you’re not going to articulate a quid pro quo. You’ll just make the quid pro quo happen.” (Daily Beast)

-- Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination next year, accused Trump of committing “treason” with his conduct toward Ukraine. “Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,” Weld said Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “It couldn’t be clearer, and that’s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It’s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty. … The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.” (John Wagner)

-- A taste of the commentary in today’s papers:

Peter Baker in the New York Times: When Trump was accused of collaborating with Russia to influence the 2016 election, he traveled the country chanting “No collusion!” This time, he is basically saying, so what if I did?

The Post’s Editorial Board: “In Ukraine, Trump’s allies are corrupt oligarchs and Russian stooges.”

Post columnist Eugene Robinson says Trump is basically begging for impeachment, so just give it to him already. “Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?”

Trump is basically begging for impeachment, so just give it to him already. “Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?” Conservative Jonah Goldberg writes in the Los Angeles Times: “The most noxious part of Ukraine-Biden whistleblower affair is Team Trump thinks we’re all idiots.”

-- In Trump’s attacks on Biden, Democrats see a worrisome reprise of 2016. Matt Viser and Isaac Stanley-Becker report: “Biden’s campaign released videos last weekend to supporters and memos to reporters attempting to debunk the unsubstantiated claims Trump is promoting about Biden, his son Hunter and Ukraine’s freshly minted celebrity president. … But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, the campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. The skirmish illustrated how ill-equipped Democrats, busy battling one another in the fight for the nomination, are to compete with Trump’s online megaphone, which includes not just his own Twitter feed and that of the Republican National Committee’s leadership, but also a regiment of conservative talking heads and highly active Internet trolls who have closed ranks around the president.”

-- To wit: Trump kept his focus on Biden at the U.N. on Monday. Sitting next to the Polish president, he claimed to reporters that, if Biden was a Republican, the media would have him in “the electric chair by right now.” Anne Gearan, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report: “‘The one who’s got the problem is Biden,’ Trump said. … At the United Nations, visiting diplomats were baffled by the sudden interjection of a complex Trump scandal that they found mystifying. ‘It puts foreign leaders in a difficult if not impossible position,’ said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ‘How do you manage this complicated person who doesn’t play the game by the rules, and how do you somehow protect this important relationship? Everybody’s a bit wary.’”

-- Bernie Sanders proposed a wealth tax plan that’s more ambitious than what Elizabeth Warren calls for. “Billionaires should not exist,” the democratic socialist from Vermont tweeted this morning. “Warren’s plan calls for levying a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million, as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion,” Sean Sullivan and Jeff Stein note. “Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million, and then increases that rate in a series of steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.”

-- The requirements to qualify for the November debate, announced by the Democratic National Committee, will imperil several more presidential campaigns. “Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro, and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer are among those who could fail to qualify for the November debates if they do not improve their polling in the coming weeks,"" Michael Scherer reports. ""Under the new November rules, candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from the October qualification levels. They will also have to meet a new polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the party, or by receiving at least 5 percent in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.”

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Office of the Special Counsel found that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing 737 Max pilots were “underqualified” and that the Federal Aviation Administration misled Congress about the issue. Michael Laris reports: “The findings of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel … have added to questions about the effectiveness and transparency of safety oversight at the FAA, which has come under scrutiny after two new 737 Max jets it had certified as safe crashed in Indonesia and Ethi­o­pia, killing 346 people. … Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner wrote that the ‘FAA’s official responses to Congress appear to have been misleading in their portrayal of FAA employee training and competency.’ … The FAA’s Office of Audit and Evaluation ‘determined’ that safety inspectors for the Max ‘had not met qualification standards. Specifically, these [inspectors] had not received formal classroom training as required by’ two FAA orders, Kerner wrote.”

-- Federal prosecutors in California are conducting a criminal probe of e-cigarette maker Juul, the Wall Street Journal reports: ""The investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office of the Northern District of California is in its early stages ... The Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration and several state attorneys general are investigating its marketing practices. … The San Francisco company has said it never marketed to teens and that its products are intended for adult cigarette smokers who want to switch.""

-- Playing hardball with money already approved by Congress, Trump's appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency are threatening to cut highway funding for California over its alleged “failure” to submit complete reports on its implementation of the Clean Air Act, the Sacramento Bee reports.

-- White House infighting, buoyed by a lack of presidential leadership, is thwarting action to address gun violence. From Politico: “On one side is Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, and Attorney General William Barr. Both are urging the president to back new firearms restrictions — including expanded background checks for gun sales — insisting he can be the leader who succeeds on an intractable issue that has bedeviled his predecessors and that he can win back moderate suburban voters in the process ... On the other side, a group that includes Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son and an avid hunter, and a top aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, is telling Trump he risks losing support from his conservative base if he pushes too aggressively on new gun control legislation ... Then there’s Trump, who has heard all of these arguments privately but publicly hasn’t committed to any plan.”

-- Rural public housing is falling apart under the Department of Agriculture’s watch, an NBC News investigation by Suzy Khimm found: “The residents of the Okeechobee Center in Belle Glade have mold creeping up their walls and ceilings riddled with holes. One mother reported roaches crawling over her infant’s face. Sewage was found leaking onto the ground outside the squat concrete buildings. These broken-down homes were built with money from U.S. taxpayers. The Okeechobee Center is part of the country’s biggest federal housing complex for farmworkers, and is supported by federal subsidies that help cover some poor families’ rent. Though the property is privately owned, it is supposed to be closely overseen by [USDA], which requires that the homes be ‘decent, safe and sanitary.’ But federal safeguards failed to prevent the property from descending into disrepair ... and now, as low-income housing like the Okeechobee Center is falling apart, the Trump administration wants to eliminate federal funding that could help fix it.”

-- The Trump administration will end the “catch and release” immigration policy that allowed immigrants claiming asylum to live in the United States while they waited for a court hearing, acting secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said. From NPR: “In a statement issued by DHS, the agency outlined how it intends to carry out its new policy starting next week. ‘If migrant family units do not claim fear of return, they will be quickly returned to their country of origin, in close collaboration with Central American countries,’ the statement read. ‘If they do claim fear, they will generally be returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).’ … McAleenan said the end of ‘catch and release’ is a reaction, in part, to the record number of 144,000 migrants apprehended or encountered at the southern border in May. He said that 72 percent were unaccompanied children or families.”

-- A team of USA Today reporters spent a week documenting the complex issues along the U.S.-Mexico border: “The week began with the death of a father and daughter. It will end with five more recorded deaths of migrants in the U.S. and untold deaths of others along the way. In that time, a young mother will become disillusioned by life in the U.S. and consider returning home. Federal authorities will release thousands of migrants, who will board buses and planes and scatter to cities across the United States. A shelter director will struggle to keep migrants in his care from being kidnapped or raped. A family in El Salvador will bury their loved ones. And still, each day, more migrants begin their journey north.”

-- A new project by the Guardian and the Marshall Project reveals how the United States built the world’s largest immigrant detention system. From “DETAINED”: “Immigrants, including asylum seekers and legal migrants, wait an average of more than four weeks to be released, though some have been held inside for years or even decades. Up to 2,500 are children and parents fleeing war and violence in their home countries. Thousands have alleged sexual and physical abuse inside the facilities. Forty years ago, this system did not exist. A modest system holding fewer than 3,000 migrants a day at the end of the 1970s, detention has now morphed into a sprawling machinery ensnaring immigrants across the country.”

-- Sen. Dan Sullivan (R), who is seeking reelection in Alaska, plans to once again vote to uphold Trump’s emergency declaration at the border, even though Sullivan's constituents will lose out on $102 million in construction projects as a result. He says he'll try to get Congress to reappropriate the money. “While I do not agree with the decision to defer any military construction in Alaska, it should be noted that the Democrats’ obstruction to fund much needed border security has forced the Trump administration to undertake these measures,"" Sullivan said in a statement to National Journal.

-- A Mexican congressman climbed the U.S. border fence to illustrate why he believes Trump’s wall is “totally absurd.” From ABC News: “Braulio Guerra, a congressman from the state of Queretaro, tweeted photos and a video of himself perched atop a 30-foot tall fence that separates the Mexican border city of Tijuana from the U.S. ‘I was able to scale it, climb it, and sit myself right here,’ Guerra said in the video. ‘It would be simple for me to jump into the United States, which shows that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall.’ He adds, ‘It's easy, and it shows how unnecessary this project, this political rhetoric from Donald Trump, is.’""

­-- The asylum agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador implies that any asylum seeker who is not from El Salvador could be sent back to that country and forced to seek asylum there, per the Intercept: “Although officials have said that the agreements would apply to people who passed through El Salvador or Guatemala en route, the text of the agreements does not explicitly make that clear. ‘This agreement is so potentially sweeping that it could be used to send an asylum-seeker who never transited El Salvador to El Salvador,’ said Eleanor Acer, senior director of refugee protection at the nonprofit organization Human Rights First. … Last week, the Salvadoran newspaper El Faro reported that the country’s agency that reviews asylum claims only has a single officer. Meanwhile, though homicide rates have gone down in recent months — since outsider president Nayib Bukele took office in June — September has already seen an increase in homicides.”

DIVIDED AMERICA:

-- Chilling: An Army private at Fort Riley, Kan., has been arrested on charges of providing instructions on how to make bombs to people he met online, including an undercover FBI agent. Devlin Barrett reports: “Pfc. Jarrett William Smith, 24, was charged with distributing information related to explosives and weapons of mass destruction. In a criminal complaint, FBI officials said Smith provided bombmaking recipes in Facebook conversations. … The FBI was alerted to Smith’s alleged statements on Facebook and used a confidential informant as well as an undercover agent to engage in online discussions with him. Over time, FBI officials said, Smith offered bombmaking formulas to them both.

“Investigators found Smith had talked about joining a far-right Ukrainian paramilitary group in 2016 but ended up joining the U.S. Army a year later. In his group conversation, Smith wrote last month that he was looking for more ‘radicals’ like himself and talked about possibly killing far-left protesters known as ‘antifa,’ or possibly destroying cell towers or a local news station, authorities have alleged. That same month, he also talked about using a vehicle bomb to attack the headquarters of a major news network, according to the criminal complaint, although authorities did not identify the network in court papers. …

“After receiving a number of recipes, the undercover agent wrote to Smith: ‘Got a liberal texas mayor in my sights! Boom with that IED and that dude’s dead.’ FBI officials said Smith replied: ‘There ya go.’ The undercover agent asked, ‘You got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction, and death?’ Smith, according to the complaint, replied: ‘Outside of Beto? I don’t know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died.’ … FBI agents arrested Smith on Saturday, and officials say that after his arrest he made several incriminating statements acknowledging he had shared bombmaking recipes with others.”

-- Facebook removed an “I Love America” page run by Ukrainians and featuring patriotic themes, rippling flags and pro-Trump memes. Craig Timberg reports: “Facebook took action against the page — which had 1.1 million followers — and several affiliated ones after a report in Popular Information, a politically themed online newsletter, detailed the page’s Ukrainian management and remarkable reach. The report said ‘I Love America’ was founded in 2017 but had moved heavily into pro-Trump content and conservative memes in recent weeks, building a huge audience in the process. Data showed the ‘I Love America’ pages collectively generated tens of millions of ‘interactions,’ a metric capturing how many people like, share or comment on a post, on par with several of the largest American news sites. ‘I Love America’ also reposted memes from Russian sources, such as the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg troll farm that faces criminal charges stemming from its efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election.”

-- A West Palm Beach Marine Corps Reserve unit canceled its plans to celebrate the corps' 244th birthday at Mar-a-Lago due to bad optics, per the Palm Beach Post, even though no tax dollars would have been spent at the president’s club.

-- Abortion restrictions are costing states millions of dollars in taxpayer money, and it's going to reproductive rights groups they're trying to destroy. Dan Keating reports: “In the past four years, taxpayers in states trying to restrict abortion access have paid almost $10 million in attorney fees for abortion providers. That price tag is likely to keep growing as more abortion restrictions are challenged, including three in federal courts today. In an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade, these states are passing laws that severely limit or prohibit abortion, hoping that the courts will uphold them. But when, instead, those new laws are thrown out, the state has to pay the legal expenses for the abortion advocates. That puts taxpayers in the position of having to pay for the attorneys on both sides of abortion battles that often last for years.”

-- Daily 202 alumna Joanie Greve, now at the Guardian, reports from Topsham, Maine, on the continuing fallout for Susan Collins of her decisive vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh: “To some Maine voters – and especially Collins’ would-be Democratic opponents – the renewed focus on Kavanaugh has opened up a fresh opportunity to unseat Collins from her crucial Senate seat. … But Republicans are responding to Democratic enthusiasm by powering an even more impressive fundraising operation for Collins, who has not yet officially announced her intention to run for re-election. … Collins’ critics have been keen to point out how much of her money has come from outside Maine, arguing it represents her ideological drift away from the center of the political spectrum.”

-- The Florida police officer who arrested two 6-year-old children at their school was fired. Allyson Chiu reports: “Orlando Police Chief Orlando Rolón said Dennis Turner, who had been suspended after the incidents Thursday at a charter school, did not follow the department’s policy requiring approval from a supervisor for any arrest of a minor younger than 12. … The charges against the children have been dropped and state attorney Aramis D. Ayala said Monday that her office never intended to prosecute. …. Prosecutors said Monday that they intervened before either of the children were taken to a juvenile detention center. But the arrests have renewed scrutiny on policing in schools, which advocates and studies say often unfairly targets students of color and those with disabilities, landing the young people in handcuffs for routine misbehavior.”

-- John Gray, the Republican candidate for chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors in Virginia, deleted offensive tweets from his account, but his political opponent, Democrat Ann Wheeler, found them and shared them. Antonio Olivo reports: “Now, as Gray seeks the highest office in the rapidly diversifying county of 456,000 people, he finds himself doing exactly what he had hoped to avoid: Explaining why, in 2016, he tweeted the falsehood that Islam sanctions domestic abuse; why he wrote ‘a funny tweet’ that same year that said African Americans would stop ‘rioting’ and take a knee if someone played the national anthem; and why, in 2017, he called former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson ‘a moron’ for wishing Indians a happy Diwali. … In July, he posted a suggestion that Muslim hookah-bar owners should be forced to sell alcohol, even though doing so would be against their religion. Gray later said he regretted that tweet, which was intended as a reference to a legal battle involving a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple based on his religious beliefs.""

Anti-Brexit supporters celebrate today outside the Supreme Court in London after the court ruled it was illegal for the prime minister to suspend Parliament. (Frank Augstein/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Britain’s Supreme Court ruled today that Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally. William Booth and Karla Adam report from London: “Opponents of the U.K. leader argued that the five-week suspension, just ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, had the effect of preventing lawmakers from scrutinizing the executive. The case could have major implications for Brexit, as well as for the balance of power in Britain. … The ruling follows a three-day court hearing last week at the highest court, which was hastily convened to weigh contrasting judgments from English and Scottish courts on Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament until mid-October. … Johnson, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, told the Daily Telegraph on Monday that he would not resign if the court ruled against him, insisting that he was correct to suspend Parliament so the government could focus on its domestic agenda. ‘It is absolutely absurd to be totally fixated on Brexit,’ he said.”

-- Johnson is also under growing fire for his relationship with a young woman and alleged misuse of public money. From the Times: “In an article published this weekend, The Sunday Times of London reported that, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, his office directed tens of thousands of pounds in government money to a fledgling entrepreneur and close friend whose apartment he often visited during working hours. The entrepreneur, Jennifer Arcuri, an American and a former model, was 27 when she first crossed paths with Mr. Johnson in 2012. In the ensuing years, she was given coveted spots on trade missions with the mayor to Tel Aviv, New York, Singapore and Malaysia. … On a plane to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Johnson repeatedly refused to answer reporters’ questions about the article, including whether he was in a sexual relationship with Ms. Arcuri at the time.”

-- British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Johnson of an “alleged abuse of power,"" but he's facing down a rebellion in his own ranks. William Booth reports: Corbyn won “enough support from his party members to continue his strategy of strategic ambiguity on whether to leave the European Union. In chaotic show of hands in a packed hall at Labour’s annual conference, delegates rejected a motion calling for the party to immediately declare itself against Brexit, as many grass-roots activists had rallied for. Instead, the party will follow Corbyn’s cautious plan to try to win the next general election and only then decide — by a special party conference — whether it will campaign to remain in or leave the E.U. in a new referendum.”

-- In a must-read op-ed highlighting the growing threat to journalists across the world, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger reveals that a U.S. government official once alerted the newspaper that the Trump administration could be sitting on information regarding the potential arrest of a Times reporter based in Egypt: “The current administration … has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press. Seeing that, other countries are targeting journalists with a growing sense of impunity. … To give you a sense of what this retreat looks like on the ground, let me tell you a story I’ve never shared publicly before. Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials. But this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn.

“We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger. Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help. Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him.”

-- Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, had one question for the global leaders assembled at the United Nations: “How dare you?” Kayla Epstein and Juliet Eilperin report: “Thunberg chastised leaders for praising young activists like herself while failing to deliver on drastic actions needed to avert the worst effects of climate change, and she warned that if the world continued with business as usual, her generation would face an insurmountable catastrophe. … ‘I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,’ said Thunberg, who traveled for two weeks on a solar-powered sailboat to reach the United States this month. … She and 15 other young people filed a legal complaint with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child arguing that major countries — Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey — have known about the risks of climate change for decades but have failed to take sufficient action to curb their emissions. … ‘For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear,’ Thunberg added. ‘How dare you continue to look away and come here and say you’re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight?’”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin summoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival Benny Gantz to work out a deal that would weld their two parties into a unity government. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “ ‘We have taken a significant step forward tonight, and now the first challenge is to establish a channel of direct communication between the sides,’ Rivlin said in a statement after the meeting. The three had agreed not to reveal the nature of the conversation ‘at this time,’ the statement said. The discussions come as the country waits for Rivlin to kick off the next phase of Israel’s protracted political process: to announce which candidate he has chosen to make the first attempt at forming a governing coalition.”

-- U.S. and Afghan forces carried out a deadly raid on al-Qaeda in southern Afghanistan, destroying an apparent weapons cache. Susannah George reports: “Launched late Sunday, the operation was aimed at al-Qaeda targets in the Musa Qala district in Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province. A fierce firefight broke out as U.S. and Afghan ground forces surrounded a compound … The exchange of fire dragged into the early hours of Monday, and when the ground troops were unable to move into the compound, a U.S. airstrike was called in. The U.S. official said it was possible that civilians were inside the compound at the time of the strike. He added that allegations of civilian deaths are under investigation.”

-- The U.N. announced the creation of a Syrian constitutional committee to rewrite the country’s constitution. Sarah Daouch and Asser Khattab report: “In a statement, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said the ‘Syrian-owned and Syrian-led’ constitutional committee will be facilitated by the United Nations in Geneva, and he thanked Russia, Turkey and Iran for their diplomatic efforts. Russia and Iran are allied with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports the opposition in Syria’s civil war.”

-- A coalition of Latin American countries decided to impose sanctions on Nicolás Maduro’s cronies in an attempt to further isolate and oust the Venezuelan president. Carol Morello reports: “Egged on by the United States and the opposition government recognized by more than 50 democracies, the foreign ministers invoked a NATO-like treaty called the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, also known as the Rio Treaty. It is rooted in the principle that a threat to one member threatens all members. … No one was specifically named besides the reviled Maduro, but the diplomats said their vote means they will identify those deemed complicit with Maduro’s government, investigate and prosecute them, and ultimately seize their assets and sentence them to prison.”

AD

The deal was brokered by Jennifer McDonald, a longtime Front Royal resident who directed the Warren County economic development authority. Washington-area developer Truc “Curt” Tran pledged to finance it with $40 million from wealthy immigrant investors and a $140 million federal contract his technology company had secured. As an added bonus, Tran would fund a police training academy overseen by longtime Sheriff Daniel T. McEathron.

AD

But those were lies, documents in Warren County Circuit Court allege.

Tran never had the money to build the data center project on the 30 acres his company bought from McDonald’s agency for $1, a civil lawsuit alleges. And the training academy was one of several hoaxes that, prosecutors and civil lawsuits claim, allowed Tran, McDonald, McEathron and others to siphon away millions in public funds, which they allegedly used to buy properties, pay bills and gambling debts, and enrich relatives and friends.

Now McEathron is dead, Tran is being sued by the economic development authority and there are state and federal investigations underway. McDonald faces 28 state counts of embezzlement, money laundering and obtaining money through false pretenses. She has denied the allegations and did not return interview requests, while Tran declined to comment through his attorney.

The claims against them, industry groups say, reflect the perils of weak oversight in economic development agencies — quasi-public entities that oversee large, complicated transactions, and whose boards often lack the financial savvy and investor scrutiny that protect their corporate counterparts. In Montgomery County, Md., an economic development official pleaded guilty this year to embezzling $6.7 million. The head of economic development in St. Louis pleaded guilty to steering lucrative contracts to the county executive’s political donors. In New Jersey, a grand jury is investigating how $500 million in tax incentives went to firms that, in part, allegedly lied on their applications.

“The lessons here are that there’s a need for better financial accountability,” said Jeff Finkle, head of the nonprofit International Economic Development Council. “People beyond one person who is managing a project where the temptation may be too great.”

On Tuesday, the Virginia State Police announced that 14 current and former local officials — including all five county supervisors — were charged with misdemeanor misfeasance and nonfeasance “based on the individuals’ knowledge of and inaction [regarding] the EDA’s mismanagement of funds.”

AD

AD

The economic development authority is teetering on insolvency. And normally neighborly Front Royal once again feels toxic, as residents wonder where else the corruption may have taken root.

“The story is just getting more complicated,” said longtime resident Melanie Salins, who co-founded a community group that has tracked a growing web of suspicious land and business deals. “For them to be able to steal from us and look us in the face like everything’s fine, it’s offensive.”

A project with 'absolutely everything'

McDonald started as a property manager for the authority in 1999 after graduating from High Point University in North Carolina with a political science degree. She became director in 2008, eventually earning $115,000 a year.

AD

Chatty and self-assured, she excelled at navigating both complex land transactions and the clubby local political landscape. She presided over the powerful Rotary Club, cheekily wore a Dallas Cowboys jersey on football Sundays in a community of die-hard Washington Redskins fans and boasted (falsely, it turned out) about winning $102,000 at the slot machines in nearby Charles Town, W.Va.

AD

As director, she helped lure Walmart, Target and a Lowe’s home improvement store to Front Royal, as well as a $100 million hospital that is under construction, a former board member said. In 2014, she met Tran, who had sought help with the data center idea from the office of then-Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), according to Pete Larkin, who was Goodlatte ’s chief of staff.

A soft-spoken resident of upscale Great Falls, Va., whose website boasts of contracts with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Tran wanted to turn part of the former Avtex Fibers manufacturing campus into a hub for cloud computing, with a three-building, $40 million complex that according to its business plan would include a restaurant, a coffee shop and a music store.

AD

McDonald’s board approved a $10 million, 90-day loan. Tran promised funding from 80 foreign investors enrolled in the federal EB-5 visa program, which offers applicants and their families a path to citizenship in exchange for the jobs their money helps create. Officials and residents gushed over the plan.

AD

“This is our first step into a new era,” then-Mayor Timothy Darr said at a 2015 groundbreaking, as McDonald, Tran and Goodlatte smiled nearby.

The regional Criminal Justice Training Academy was announced the following year. McDonald said an anonymous donor would provide $8 million, and told her board the donor was Tran, the civil lawsuit says. McEathron, a fellow Rotarian, would be in charge.

AD

The broad-shouldered sheriff was a morning fixture at a vinyl-booth diner on Main Street. He had launched a summer camp and amused his deputies by playing faux saxophone as they lip synced to “Love Shack” by the B-52’s. The training academy further raised his profile.

“This is the first time we’ve ever done anything like this,” McDonald said, according to an account in the Northern Virginia Daily.

McEathron boasted: “We can offer absolutely everything at this facility.”

Starting to unravel

It all seemed in­cred­ibly fortunate. Until late 2016, when some town officials and residents looked up Tran’s company online.

AD

They found it hadn’t yet been allowed to solicit investments under the EB-5 program. The $140 million federal contract appeared to be a mirage, with Tran receiving no payments from it. Skeptics asked increasingly pointed questions at public meetings, sparking warnings from Town Council members that the naysayers would blow Front Royal’s big chance.

AD

“They chewed me up and down,” said Bébhinn Egger, a former council member who was among the first to raise alarms. “It only took me about 15 minutes of research to see that there was something fishy going on.”

In an email to McDonald in early 2017, Tran said the questions meant “our ability to raise capital within the EB-5 investor community is now in jeopardy,” court records filed as part of the civil lawsuit show. His company was eventually approved for the program, then later disqualified, a decision Tran is appealing, according to U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which administers the EB-5 program.

The Town Council authorized $1.7 million of infrastructure improvements for the Avtex site, and according to the lawsuit, McDonald allegedly paid Tran at least $1.5 million for construction costs without informing her board.

In 2018, Front Royal’s finance director discovered a bigger red flag: The authority had overbilled Front Royal nearly $300,000 for its portion of debt service related to the Avtex site and a road improvement project. At a meeting about the discrepancy, McDonald nonchalantly said she had mistakenly falsified some invoices, Town Attorney Doug Napier recalled.

AD

AD

“She was not at all contrite,” Napier said. “It just shocked me.”

The revelation prompted a call to state police and an independent review of the authority’s books that uncovered a dizzying array of phony invoices, phantom projects, secret land deals and bank wire transfers to entities controlled by McDonald or her friends, according to a copy of the review completed in May by the Cherry Bekaert accounting firm. The probe was commissioned by the authority and is the basis of the criminal and civil proceedings.

McDonald allegedly billed the authority more than $50,000 to pay for renovating a vacant inn, then used those funds to pay credit card bills, according to the review. She is accused of doctoring invoices to secure $4.6 million for purchasing tax credits, then embezzling that money.

A plumbing company owned by her husband, Sammy North, allegedly collected at least $66,200 in secret payments, the review found. North has also been arrested, as was Donald F. Poe, a family friend accused of conspiring with McDonald to funnel $841,409 to his solar panel installation company for work the board didn’t authorize.

AD

North did not return messages seeking comment. Ryan Huttar, an attorney for Poe’s company, said that his client performed the work it was hired to do and that it reimbursed the authority $335,000 when one job was canceled.

Attorneys in the civil lawsuit say McDonald allegedly convinced the authority to buy land from her aunt and uncle for a workforce housing project without disclosing that they were her relatives, and billed the authority an additional $130,000 in the transaction, most of which went to pay off what appeared to be her mortgage.

“You’d think somebody, somewhere along the line, would have an inkling that something was amiss earlier on,” said Napier, who filed a lawsuit on behalf of Front Royal seeking $15 million in damages from the authority and Warren County.

“This community is sort of like Mayberry,” Napier said. “We’re not used to criminality in government here.”

Allegations, arrests, tragedy

McEathron wasn’t charged. But he may have felt the tide turning against him.

He and McDonald had launched a real estate investment company called DaBoyz LLC in 2016, shortly after they announced the police academy. The firm used $3.5 million in authority funds to buy four properties, the independent review found. McDonald and McEathron also bought a three-bedroom home in Virginia Beach, which they rented to McEathron’s son and daughter-in-law, court records in the civil lawsuit show.

In one curious transaction, which lawyers for the authority say may have been an attempt to launder money, DaBoyz paid Rappawan, a construction company, $1.9 million for a large tract of land and then sold it back a month later for $1.3 million. Rappawan owner William T. Vaught Jr. declined to comment, citing the criminal investigations.

In March, the authority filed its own lawsuit, against McDonald, McEathron, Tran, their companies and two contractors. The following month, the FBI raided the authority’s offices, seizing documents in what signified the launch of a U.S. Justice Department investigation, according to local news reports at the time. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Western District of Virginia declined to discuss the probe, which Warren County officials confirmed was underway.

The sheriff was despondent over his tarnished image, his attorney said. He took early retirement in May. A few weeks later, he testified before a local grand jury, appearing at the county courthouse with his wife, a member of the county School Board.

Then, just before Memorial Day weekend, McDonald was arrested.

The following Tuesday, McEathron killed himself outside his family’s secluded mountainside home. Some of his deputies found his body. The gun was nearby.

“Either knowingly or unknowingly, he allowed himself to become involved in some of the things that apparently happened,” said Ron Llewellyn, a former county supervisor who was a friend of McEathron’s and served on the authority’s board when McDonald was director.

Llewellyn was among those indicted this week. He denies wrongdoing and said the allegations against the sheriff go against his memories of a man he saw as a pleasant, by-the-book law enforcement official.

But, he added, the evidence against McEathron is damning.

“I just can’t believe that he wasn’t aware of some of it,” Llewellyn said.

'Tip of the iceberg'

McDonald was charged this summer with additional counts of money laundering and grand larceny. Her husband was arrested on counts of money laundering and obtaining money by false pretenses. The local grand jury, which was initially set to finish its work this month, requested another six months to investigate.

While out of jail on $75,000 bond, McDonald lost a different court battle, with a judge in a defamation lawsuit ruling that she staged burglaries at her office and home in 2017 to try to deflect suspicions against her. The judge awarded County Supervisor Thomas H. Sayre (R-Shenandoah) $20,000 in damages for being implicated in those phony crimes.

Tuesday’s announcement included charges against Sayre, who denied wrongdoing through his attorney. Several others denied wrongdoing as well, or declined to comment.

Tran’s company has put a small, one-story office building on the Avtex site and is working to repay the $10 million loan from the authority. Tran was able to extend the term to 2045, officials said.

Because of one of the lawsuits, Tran is forbidden to sell the property, valued at $2.2 million. Court levies have also been placed on seven properties McDonald owns, plus six cars and $82,500 she has in the bank.

In hopes of regaining financial stability, the authority is trying to sell several of its properties, including a building on Main Street that Jeff and Ginny Leser leased in 2018 to open a general store. The couple hadn’t known about the brewing scandal. Or that the same building previously housed a store McDonald, her friend William Lambert and her former aide Michelle Henry allegedly used as a vehicle to steal more agency money.

Henry has been charged with embezzlement; Lambert with money laundering and obtaining money by false pretense. Lambert’s attorney, Phillip Griffin, said he has entered a plea of not guilty, adding that his client is “a minor player” in the scandal. Henry did not return phone messages; neither did Ryan Nuzzo , the attorney who represented her at her bond hearing.

The Lesers spent $9,000 to fix a bathroom the authority refused to repair. Last month, they closed their store, frustrated by sluggish sales, a warped ceiling and leaky roof, and the possibility that the building could be sold out from under them.

“I try not to feel like a failure,” Ginny Leser said in an interview. “But I do feel foolish.”

Local activists, who had called for the state and federal investigations to be expanded, rejoiced at Tuesday’s announcement.

“Somebody is finally listening,” said Salins, co-founder of the Warren County Coalition watchdog group. “It’s not every day that your entire government gets arrested. It’s so shameful.”

Residents had been pointing to emails between McDonald and other officials — some of which surfaced in the independent review, and some of which were printed out and dropped anonymously in mailboxes — that appear to demonstrate the government was aware of some suspicious transactions.

And they had been demanding answers from Supervisor Tony Carter (R-Happy Creek), another of the people charged in the recent indictments. Carter works for his mother’s insurance company, Stoneburner-Carter, which holds insurance policies on four properties owned by the authority and has collected about $46,000 in premiums since 2015, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

He didn’t return calls Tuesday, but said earlier that the insurance contract does not pose a conflict because he doesn’t own the company and, therefore, doesn’t directly benefit from the payments.

“If I did have ownership, that would have precluded me from writing those policies,” he said. “I did what was legally correct.”

Kristie Atwood, whose Facebook page One Mad Mother has become a repository of news about the investigations, called the latest indictments “just the tip of the iceberg.”"

For a minute there, it looked like Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 campaign would burst into flames five feet above its launchpad. The senator began her presidential bid by attempting to nullify one of her conspicuous liabilities — only to amplify that liability, amuse conservatives, and alienate indigenous groups. Within months, her finance director had quit, and her top left-wing rival had out fundraised her by an order of magnitude. Then, Joe Biden made his candidacy official, and promptly opened up a 30-point lead over the Massachusetts senator.

Nevertheless, she persisted. And with a little over four months before Iowa gets caucusing, Warren’s prospects have radically changed. As of this writing, betting markets now consider her by far the most likely candidate to win the Democratic nomination. For months now, each wave of new polling has shown her star steadily rising both nationally and in early primary states. And the latest batch of surveys is no exception.

A national Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday finds Warren’s support nationally climbing from 19 percent in August to 27 percent today — a large enough gain to put her ahead of Biden in that survey for the first time ever. Meanwhile, a new UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll of the California primary suggests Warren has gained 11 points in the Golden State since June, giving her a commanding lead over the rest of the field. Meanwhile, the most recent data from the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire comport with this general trend.

But the best news for Warren in these polls may lay beneath the headline data. Here are five quick takeaways from the last week of polling that bode well for Warren’s odds of facing Trump next November:

1) Biden is bending, and just might break.

If you only looked at the national polling averages, Uncle Joe would appear to be in very solid shape. RealClearPolitics’s poll of polls has Biden boasting 29 percent support, which is just a tiny shade beneath where he’s typically been over the past three months; in other words, the national data shows no steep or uniform decline in Biden’s standing.

But in the early voting states — where each campaign’s resources have been concentrated — the picture looks much dimmer for the former vice-president. At the start of July, Biden’s average support in Iowa was 26 percent; today, it’s just 20. Warren now leads the field in the Hawkeye State by nearly three points in RCP’s polling average. And surveys from New Hampshire tell a similar story: As of mid-July, Biden was leading Warren there by an average of 22 points; now, he leads by an average of three. And Monmouth University poll released this week has Warren ahead of him by two.

Meanwhile, the national landscape may be in the process of converging on Iowa and New Hampshire’s: In Quinnipiac’s newly released national poll, Biden’s support is 7 percent lower than it was in the same survey one month ago. Other pollsters have documented declines in the percentage of Biden supporters who are “enthusiastic” about their candidate. Finally, there are some non-empirical reasons to think the former vice president’s standing will continue to erode. Thus far, Biden has benefited from the perception that he would be a uniquely “electable” nominee. But the increasingly conspicuous decline in his verbal skills — combined with the fact that the Democrats’ newly launched impeachment push is sure to call attention to his son Hunter’s influence-peddling (and Trump’s ostensibly, wildly false allegation that Biden corruptly intervened to fire a Ukranian prosecutor who was looking into Hunter’s company) — could erode Biden’s claim to being the Democrats’ “safe” option.

2) Warren’s base of support appears to be diversifying.

For most of the campaign, one of Warren’s apparent weaknesses was her coalition’s demographic homogeneity: She commanded the adoration of college-educated whites, but piddling levels of support among most other parts of the Democratic coalition.

This fact lent itself to two competing interpretations:

1) Something about Warren’s persona or program made her a niche candidate, who was already near her ceiling of support (there being only so many white professionals in blue America) and would thus fade away.

or

2) College-educated whites were more likely than other Democrats to be paying close attention to the primary race. Thus, Warren’s poor showing with nonwhite, and non-college-educated voters merely reflected the fact that her name was not as widely recognized as Joe Biden’s or Bernie Sanders’s. And if this were the case, then her strong support among college-educated whites might actually be a leading indicator of her appeal to the broader Democratic coalition: Once other groups began tuning in to this year’s race, they too would see the same things that had made “Patagonia Democrats” swoon.

While there may be an element of truth to No. 1 (Warren does appear to be especially appealing to Democrats who share her skin tone and academic pedigree), recent polling data has made the second look increasingly plausible. Quinnipiac’s new national poll show’s Warren’s coalition diversifying in both racial and class terms. In fact, the Q-poll has Warren beating Biden among white voters without a college degree by a remarkable 37 to 20 percent margin.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

New Quinnipiac poll this morning shows Warren making inroads among black voters:



July:

Biden 53%

Warren 4%



August:

Biden 47%

Warren 8%



Now:

Biden 40%

Warren 19% — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) September 25, 2019

The Los Angeles Times poll of California tells a similar story. After performing poorly with non-college whites in the same poll back in June, Warren now claims 29 percent of the demographic’s vote, while Sanders and Biden respectively boast 20 and 18 percent. And although Biden still leads the field with 40 percent support among African-American voters, Warren now has 24 percent support among that key demographic in California, putting her in second with that constituency.

But there’s even more direct evidence that Warren’s real base isn’t college-educated white voters, so much as it is voters who are paying attention: In the progressive think-tank Data For Progress’s polling of the 2020 primary, Warren consistently performs best among voters express a high level of interest in the news — including non-college-educated and non-white news junkies.

3) Harris 2020 (almost certainly) isn’t happening.

For a brief period in early July, Kamala Harris led both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in national polls. The California senator also boasted considerable support among professional Democrats and liberal donors. Many observers expected her to emerge as Biden’s main rival. But she’s proven to be the 2020 version of Scott Walker — a candidate with strong Establishment support who makes a lot of sense on paper, but never made much headway with actual voters. Quinnipiac now pegs Harris’s support at a mere 3 percent; her average in national polls is 5 percent. Critically, her numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are almost identical to her national figures. Unless she orchestrates an improbable comeback in one of those early states, Harris could be forced to euthanize her campaign by early March, leaving Warren the only viable option for Democrats who wish to elect a female president.

4) Warren is acceptable to a broader range of Democratic voters than any of her rivals.

Both the Quinnipiac national poll, and Los Angeles Times California survey, show Warren with a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than Biden or Sanders. And the Times finds that nearly 70 percent of California Democrats rank Warren as their first or second choice. Those results are consistent with a Data For Progress/Civiqs national poll released earlier this month, which showed Warren as the most popular second choice among Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris voters. And several other surveys have produced similar findings. This obviously bodes well for Warren if and when the Democratic field narrows, and suggests that a contested convention, she may have a strong claim to being a “unity” figure.

5) Sanders is stagnating.

Bernie Sanders’s campaign is very much alive. The Vermont senator’s has amassed enviable donor and volunteer networks, and has led in multiple recent polls of early primary states. Still, Sanders’s support has been stagnant nationally for months now, while his average share of the vote in Iowa has fallen from 19 percent in July to 12 percent today. Given that the senator is already well-known among Democratic primary voters, it is not clear how much room he has to grow. Sanders has made no secret of the fact that he favors Warren over his other primary rivals. So, it is at least possible to imagine a scenario in which Sanders’s campaign runs out of steam by next April, and then throws its considerable resources behind Warren.

Of course, Warren’s nomination remains far from a sure thing. Biden’s numbers are still formidable. Sanders is still within striking distance. And it’s still early. But at this point, there’s a strong case that Warren is the candidate you’d want to be."

The Gini index measures wealth distribution across a population, with zero representing total equality and 1 representing total inequality, where all wealth is concentrated in a single household. The indicator has been rising steadily for several decades. When the Census Bureau began studying income inequality in 1967, the Gini index was 0.397. In 2018, it climbed to 0.485.

By comparison, no European nation had a score greater than 0.38 last year.

The federal minimum wage has stood at $7.25 for more than a decade. That’s one of the biggest reasons the gap between the rich and poor is widening, said Brielle Bryan, an assistant professor of sociology at Rice University.

“Inequality will go up as long as the people at the top of the tail are seeing their wealth increase,” Bryan said. “A booming economy means that people who have higher income and own capital are able to see continued higher returns on that.”

Recent economic gains by lower-income workers who have found jobs and benefited from minimum-wage increases in many states haven’t made up for the long-running trend of the wealthy seeing far larger income growth than middle- or lower-income earners. The number of families earning $15,000 or less has fallen since 2007, according to the latest census data, while the number of households bringing in $250,000 a year or more has grown more than 15 percent.

The persistent rise in inequality has become a central topic in the 2020 presidential race, with candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren calling for a wealth tax. This week, Sanders unveiled a proposal that would impose a tax as high as 8 percent on the ultrawealthy, raising $4.35 trillion over a decade, according to an analysis by economists who consulted with the Warren and Sanders campaigns.

“There should be no billionaires,” Sanders tweeted when he announced his plan. “We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people.”

Systemic inequality is actually starkest in the top tier of the economic ladder, which is populated primarily by white men, Bryan said. Women in the 95th percentile of earners make around 68 cents on the dollar compared with their male counterparts.

“We don’t have as much sympathy for CEOs,” Bryan said, “but what’s happening at the top end is really symbolic of problems happening throughout the system.”

This is a column about Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and why you should or should not prefer the former over the latter. But before digging into that question, I’d like call your attention to something that is too often ignored in the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate: The American left’s bark is louder than its bite.

In recent years, socialists and their left-liberal fellow travelers have accrued an unprecedented degree of influence over our nation’s political discourse. As the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis undermined mainstream economic orthodoxy — and radicalized a generation of overeducated, underemployed journalists and academics — the technocracy’s center of gravity shifted leftward. In 2019, the Democrats’ Establishment think tank is agitating for industry-wide collective bargaining, the mainstream media has adopted a reflexively sympathetic attitude toward striking public-sector workers, and conscious capitalists are giving TED Talks on the evils of neoliberalism.

Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders’s surprising strength in the 2016 primaries and Hillary Clinton’s devastating weakness in that year’s general election — and the online left’s success in popularizing its interpretations of both phenomena— persuaded many 2020 Democratic hopefuls to stop worrying and learn to love social democracy. At the first three Democratic debates, the middle-ground position on health care was a public option strong enough to jeopardize the viability of private insurance. On higher education, it was free public college for all children from working-class families. On climate, it was “only” $1.7 trillion in green investments, and a mandate for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But the left’s ideological clout far outstrips its material strength. American socialism is heavy on superstructure, light on base. The current trade-union movement is weak by historic standards, representing a piddling 10.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. Independent leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have grown since 2016 but still lack the scale and mass working-class membership that made such entities formidable agents of social change in earlier eras of American history. In the electoral realm, progressive challengers scored a couple notable victories in the 2018 primaries but failed to foment a “tea party of the left.” Outside of low-turnout elections in deep-blue districts, organizations like Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, and DSA gave Democratic incumbents little cause for fearing their wrath. And where left insurgents did win open primaries in purple territory, they failed to affirm their theory of change: Nominating economic populists unencumbered by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s allergy to class-warfare rhetoric and radical reforms like Medicare for All did not fix what’s the matter with Kansas. Sanders-backed ironworker Randy Bryce did worse in Wisconsin’s 1st District last year than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Single-payer supporter Kara Eastman failed to flip Nebraska’s 2nd. The 2018 elections did not prove the electoral necessity of moderation — Warren acolyte Katie Porter pulled out a tough win in a historically Republican California district; Senator Tammy Baldwin’s calls for abolishing private insurance and putting workers on corporate boards proved compatible with winning reelection in a Trump state — but nor did they prove that Sanders-ism an electoral panacea.

Thus far, the 2020 primary has further undermined the notion that Democratic voters will overwhelmingly support radical change if only the left can get the Establishment’s thumbs off the scale. Joe Biden owes his front-runner status less to his party’s high-dollar donors than its high-propensity voters. Few Democratic pooh-bahs went into 2019 favoring Uncle Joe. Many saw Kamala Harris as Hillary’s heiress apparent, while others were so averse to backing Obama’s senescent wingman that they put their chips on the mayor of South Bend instead. But the people (or a plurality of them, anyway) have preferred Biden. The fact that Warren and Sanders are his chief rivals — rather than Harris and Buttigieg — may reflect the radicalization of some segments of the Democratic electorate. But much of the rank and file evinces little interest in their party’s ideological divides. And a significant portion of Democratic-base voters still espouse a preference for ideological moderation (however hazily defined).

Finally, even if the left were to build enthusiastic majoritarian support for a radical break with “Obamaism” among both Democratic-primary voters and the general public, it might still have difficulty enacting its legislative agenda. Both chambers of Congress overrepresent the most conservative elements in American society. And with its six-year terms and immense incumbency advantages, the Senate largely insulates Democrats in even the bluest states from grassroots pressure (see: Feinstein, Dianne).

The left is too weak to enact Sanders’s or Warren’s big plans. Do either of them have a plan for that?

Much of the time, the Democratic left is content to wage its “Bernie vs. Warren” civil war in a parallel universe free of this context. Sanders supporters comb through the Warren campaign’s every utterance on health care for intimations of agnosticism on single-payer, as though the chief obstacle to Medicare for All in 2021 will be the next Democratic president’s lack of backbone rather than the fact that there are currently 14 votes for Bernie’s bill in Chuck Schumer’s caucus (and none of the Democrats who oppose single-payer had any trouble winning renomination in the 2018 primaries). Meanwhile, progressive intellectuals debate the relative merits of Warren’s left-liberalism and Sanders’s “democratic socialism” as though the central question facing the next Democratic administration will be whether to implement the Meidner plan or settle for Denmark’s model of social democracy.

This isn’t to say that there are no areas where Warren’s and Sanders’s disparate worldviews and personal backgrounds could have real substantive implications. The commander-in-chief has immense discretion over foreign policy, and up to now Sanders appears more interested than Warren in radically reforming the Democratic Party’s approach to geopolitics. The president also has considerable power to shape domestic policy through regulatory appointments and creative interpretations of existing statutory authority — forms of “lawfare” to which Warren may be especially well suited.

Given how far the left is from possessing the power it will need to turn its wildest “green dreams” into reality, however, the most worthwhile Bernie-versus-Warren arguments may concern tactics, not policy. Whether Sanders’s approach to expropriating the billionaire class is preferable to Warren’s isn’t a question that’s likely to be of much practical consequence in the medium-term future. But whether his approach to winning elections — and using his power to build up the left’s — is more viable than Warren’s absolutely is.

In recent days, the staunchly pro-Sanders publication Jacobin has made the latter case, arguing that Sanders’s theory of change is both radically distinct from and superior to Warren’s. Refreshingly, the socialist magazine premises its argument on a frank acknowledgement of the left’s sorry state. In its account, Warren may have been a suitable agent of structural change three decades ago, when the grassroots left was still strong enough to arrange “a tense but functional relationship between a reformist administration in the White House and a strong and organized working class that could at least challenge capital’s imperatives.” But in the current context, the left doesn’t command enough divisions to make use of Warren’s technocratic gifts. It needs foot soldiers, not plans. And Bernie Sanders is uniquely capable of reassembling the left’s army because of his deeper commitment to radical, bottom-up change, his greater appeal to blue-collar constituencies, and his more unabashedly adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party.

I find this unconvincing. But Jacobin’s case merits examination, as it’s focused on the right questions: How do we get from where we are to a polity in which our plans actually matter? And is Warren or Sanders more likely to get us there?

The differences between Sanders and Warren may be smaller than they appear (in Jacobin articles, anyway).

One obstacle to a productive debate over whether Warren or Sanders is a more viable agent of change is the temptation to exaggerate the distinctions between their respective modes of operation. In “Elizabeth Warren’s Strategy Within the Democratic Party Is All Wrong,” Jacobin’s (typically incisive) Branko Marcetic falls prey to that impulse. In his column, Marcetic argues that the Massachusetts senator’s reported outreach to the Democratic Establishment betrays her commitment to an “inside strategy” that is bound to fail. The problem with his argument is that its central premise — that Warren’s decision to court power players in the Democratic Party sharply distinguishes her campaign from Sanders’s — appears to be false.

Marcetic’s essay is based on a New York Times story from last month that reported that, in an apparent bid to ingratiate herself with superdelegates, Warren had told influential Democratic brokers that she wanted to build power within the party and wouldn’t be assembling her own independent grassroots army. Sanders’s supporters responded to this news with (gleeful) indignation, as it appeared to heighten the contradictions between his and her theories of change. And yet, the most significant difference ostensibly established by the Times article — that Warren was forswearing the kind of independent organizing that Sanders champions — wasn’t actually any distinction at all. Oddly, Marcetic concedes this point in a parenthetical but declines to address its implications for his broader argument:

On August 26, the New York Times reported that Warren has been aggressively courting Democratic officials behind the scenes, assuring them, in the paper’s telling, that she is a loyal Democrat and does not plan to create her own political or organizing infrastructure outside the party. (The next day, the Association of State Democratic Committees announced that Sanders and a number of other candidates have, like Warren, pledged not to create “any organizing or messaging infrastructure that is parallel or duplicative” to the DNC or state parties.)

Marcetic proceeds to suggest that, even if Warren’s pledge is not as distinctive as it first appeared, her courting of superdelegates is:

Besides trying to convince Democrats that her progressive ideas won’t make her “unelectable,” Warren’s private assurances that she simply wants to breathe new life into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and help the party recapture Congress, the Times notes, also have a politically strategic element. Thanks to a rule change last year, if no single candidate wins an outright majority of delegates in the primaries — a plausible scenario in this crowded field — the superdelegates will once again have a large role in choosing the nominee, this time on the second ballot. And, should it come down to a second ballot, Warren wants their votes.

It’s unclear how easily these overtures to the DNC will sit with Warren’s plans for major structural change in the United States.

This distinction, too, is nonexistent: In May, a Sanders-campaign aide told BuzzFeed News, “We’re taking superdelegates and superdelegates strategy seriously, hence having a team dedicated to delegates who can prepare for multiple convention scenarios. We will be reaching out to them over the course of the campaign. When the senator wins the nomination, he’s eager to work with them to support and unite all the party in the general and beyond.”

There is nothing especially telling about a candidate’s seeking the approval of powerful figures in the party whose nomination he or she is trying to win. To neglect such “inside” tactics would be political malpractice, as the Sanders campaign readily acknowledges.

Nevertheless, differences between each candidate’s relationship with the Democratic Party persist.

All this said, it is true that, as a general matter, Sanders has a more adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party than Warren. He has, of course, refused to join the party for the duration of his congressional career, and he has used that formal independence to criticize the Democratic Establishment with a (generally righteous) fury that Warren has reserved for financial executives. He has also made some efforts to build an independent political infrastructure capable of challenging incumbent Democrats that refuse to get with his program (though he has apparently promised to suspend those efforts upon winning the nomination).

Given these facts, it isn’t wholly implausible to view the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate as a proxy for a broader dispute over the left’s relationship to the Democratic Party. Namely: Should progressives and socialists seek to co-opt the Democratic brand, build power within its institutions, and seek accommodation with its leadership, out of a recognition that the left is strong enough (and, for now, ideologically fashionable enough) to exert influence as one interest group within the Democrats’ big tent but far too weak to establish an independent political identity capable of capturing the loyalties of the Democratic base? Or is the Democratic brand too toxic with the working class — and its leadership too entrenched and aligned with capital — to be worth co-opting? Which is to say: Is popularizing a socialist identity that can bridge America’s partisan divide and mobilize its nonvoters — while building an independent party-like entity capable of disciplining its candidates and putting the fear of obsolescence into the Democratic leadership — the only path to radical reform?

It is not clear to me that Sanders is personally committed to the latter theory of change (given his aforementioned pledge, and decades of productive cooperation with the Democratic leadership, it seems possible that becoming blue America’s standard-bearer would dispel his reservations about working within the two-party system). But many of his most enthusiastic, socialist supporters are; Jacobin’s editors, and many members of the DSA, proselytize an electoral strategy of building an independent socialist party that competes on the Democratic ballot line when necessary. And even if a President Sanders does not directly participate in that project, the election of a self-avowed socialist would surely abet such efforts more than that of a staunchly pro-market progressive Democrat.

So, for the sake of argument, let’s stipulate that Bernie plans to violate his pledges and brook no compromise with the Democrats’ old regime. What is the evidence for the premise that forswearing all accommodation with the Democratic Party would maximize the left’s gains?

Toward the end of his column, Marcetic gestures at one answer:

An insurgent movement like the Tea Party made heavy use of confrontational tactics and primary challenges to wrench the Republican Party toward its end of the political spectrum. Donald Trump’s antagonistic relationship with a GOP establishment that largely opposed him didn’t stop him from both winning the Republican primary and the general election, and today’s GOP has been refashioned in Trump’s image, with even his fiercest Republican critics now fully signing on to his agenda. Trump did this not by convincing members of the GOP establishment that he was correct, but by rallying voters and making it virtually impossible for Republicans to both keep their jobs and oppose him. If the next Democratic president fails to achieve something similar, they won’t just face an obstructionist Republican bloc, but a host of conservative Democrats who will stand as a barrier to their agenda, just as Obama did in 2009…Only a direct challenge to the power of those elites will enable a progressive president to overcome it.

There are several problems with this analogy. First, it is not clear why pursuing diplomacy with Establishment factions — while seeking control of a party’s apparatus — is incompatible with abetting some primary challenges (Warren’s staff has significant ties to the organization Justice Democrats, which exists to orchestrate such campaigns). Second, Donald Trump absolutely sought reconciliation with the GOP Establishment upon winning his party’s nomination in 2016, noticeably adjusted his platform to suit its wishes, and owed his victory largely to the strength of the RNC’s infrastructure (his own campaign being a ramshackle mess). Third, Trump’s fiercest critics have not actually “fully” signed on to his agenda. In fact, Republican senators have repeatedly rebuffed the president on his signature issue, voting down Trump’s proposed reductions in legal immigration by wide margins. One might therefore interpret Trump as a testament to the limitations of the inside game. But then does anyone really believe that America’s nativists would be exercising more power in our politics had they begrudged Trump his accommodations with the GOP’s corporate wing or attempted to popularize an independent political identity, instead of seeking to claim the Republican Party as their own? And can anyone argue that Trump has been too soft on his intraparty critics?

The lesson of Trump’s failure to rally Republican senators behind his immigration agenda is that it is extremely hard to force a U.S. senator to vote for something he or she strongly opposes — whether through direct challenges or backroom cajoling. Six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and, in many cases, the ability to obstruct all of a president’s other priorities make it very hard for a White House to hold any senator’s feet to the fire. Putting the fear of a credible primary challenge into all 33 of the Democratic senators who’ve withheld their support for Bernie’s health-care bill looks implausible on its face. And given the left’s showing in House races in 2018 (not to mention its sorry efforts at Senate challenges), the task appears even more implausible upon closer examination.

The left’s weakness makes it trivially easy to demonstrate how someone else’s approach to creating radical change will prove inadequate. It is much harder to make a persuasive case for one’s own. Sanders supporters are right that nothing less than a political revolution can make Medicare for All and a Green New Deal realities. But the evidence that Bernie is capable of fomenting such a revolution is limited. On the one hand, Sanders has assembled impressive small-dollar donor armies and volunteer networks. His ascent has undoubtedly abetted DSA’s growth. And he has used his vast email list to recruit reinforcements for various labor actions and protests, thereby demonstrating his commitment to social movements and to non-electoral forms of political contestation.

On the other hand, Sanders has had a national platform for three years now. He has built up an independent organization and traveled the country proselytizing for class struggle. And none of it has been sufficient for his acolytes to dominate Democratic primaries, or to win him a broader base of support for his 2020 run than he had in 2016, or even to keep his approval rating from slipping underwater. Although one can point to some polls showing Sanders with an enviable favorability rating, RealClearPolitics’ polling average shows the public disapproving of the socialist senator by a margin of 46.3 to 43.1 percent. It is possible that Sanders’s popularity and influence will balloon once he attains power. But it’s worth noting that even Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s historic popularity — and the existence of strong labor, socialist, and communist movements — were insufficient to render FDR’s attempted “purge” of anti–New Deal Democrats in the 1938 primaries successful.

In light of these facts, is it not conceivable that a president more closely aligned with the Democratic Party — and less openly hostile to its key power centers — would actually be able to get senators like Jon Tester and Kyrsten Sinema to swallow marginally more progressive legislation in 2021 than a president with an independent political identity who projected contempt for their wing of the party? Put differently, would such senators feel more inclined to perform their independence from a socialist president who’d deliberately stoked the enmity of centrist Democrats, or a “capitalist to her bones” progressive president who’d nursed Third Wayers’ threatened egos?

I do not want to live in a republic where maximizing the number of Americans with quality health insurance requires buttering up Joe Manchin in back rooms. But are we sure that that isn’t the republic we’ll be living in for the foreseeable future?

To be sure, many of Sanders’s socialist supporters see their project as a generational one. And the incremental benefits of maximizing the left’s clout in the Democratic Party today (with all the distasteful, coalition-solidifying compromises that ostensibly requires) may pale next to the radical possibilities that militancy could open up tomorrow. After all, even if righteous intransigence does not immediately inspire a mobilization capable of cowing centrist Democrats, the struggle could facilitate the recruitment of progressives into the independent, mass-membership socialist party, a development sought by Jacobin. And yet, even if the goal is to maximize the left’s power in 2030, it’s not obvious why building a party-like structure outside of the Democratic tent is a more promising strategy than competing for authority within it.

As Jacobin’s Seth Ackerman has ably explained, American election law treats the two major parties as state institutions and uses discriminatory ballot-access rules to stymie third parties. For this reason, he insists that socialists make peace with competing on the Democratic ballot line, even as they build a “a membership-run organization with its own name, its own logo, its own identity and therefore its own platform, and its own ideology.” And yet the institutionalization of the two major parties, combined with partisan polarization, makes the task of popularizing an alternative, left-wing political identity enormously difficult. The American left will achieve nothing without the backing of the black working class. And while not all African-Americans proudly identify as Democrats, a very hefty percentage of them feel a profound loyalty to the party of civil rights and Barack Obama. And the same is true for many of the left’s other key constituencies. At present, the Democratic Party is an institution that manages to put Latinx housekeepers in Las Vegas in coalition with white industrial laborers in Dearborn, black church ladies in Charleston, and long-winded politics bloggers in Manhattan. The party’s infrastructure is relatively porous on the local level, where even the most formidable Democratic “machines” have proved unable to fend off challenges from charismatic bartenders. And while the party’s base voters have strong partisan identities, many are open to a wide range of definitions of what it means to be a true Democrat in ideological terms; some recent surveys suggest Bernie Sanders is the most popular second choice among Joe Biden backers.

Given these conditions, why isn’t commandeering the Democratic Party’s infrastructure, platform, and considerable social base not a simpler, faster, and more viable path to power than attempting to build an entirely new party and political identity and then hijacking the Democrats’ ballot line — in the ostensible hope that voters who affirmatively choose to register as Democrats will look more favorably on leftist primary challengers who disparage their party than on candidates who claim membership in it?

Proletarians prefer L.L. Bean?

In “Elizabeth Warren Is Thirty Years Too Late,” Connor Kilpatrick and Bhaskar Sunkara do not address this question directly. But their analysis suggests that the existing Democratic coalition is too heavily reliant on affluent voters for the party to serve as an effective vehicle of radical change, and that Bernie’s relative distance from the taint of the Democratic brand and greater affinity for class politics and bottom-up organizing make him uniquely capable of winning back the legions of working-class voters whom Third Way Democrats lost to right-wing populism or political apathy.

Like Marcetic’s piece, Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s draws strong conclusions from limited evidence. The authors observe that Sanders’s support among Democratic-primary voters is markedly less white and more working-class than Warren’s. In fact, many surveys have suggested that Warren owes her viability to overwhelming support among professional-class white liberals — or, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara describe them, “Patagonia Democrats.” This distinction between the class composition of the two progressive candidates’ nascent coalitions has become a popular talking point among Sanders supporters. And it may have some validity. In Vermont, Sanders has regularly outperformed other Democrats with white, non-college-educated voters. It’s plausible that his brand of politics may play better with a critical mass of secular, rural, white swing voters in Wisconsin, and therefore that he would be a stronger general-election candidate than Warren.

But Kilpatrick and Sunkara use this polling data to make a far more sweeping claim. Sanders’s greater appeal with blue-collar Democratic-primary voters doesn’t merely suggest he can improve on Clinton’s margins in Kenosha County, but that he can reorient the polarization of U.S. politics along class lines. In their telling, Warren’s coalition is potentially broad “enough to keep Republicans from the White House but not Congress or state legislatures. It would be yet another coalition that could win but never govern.” Bernie’s working-class coalition, by contrast, would have the numbers and self-interest necessary to force radical change through political institutions that were designed to thwart it.

That America’s low- and middle-income workers do not share a class consciousness or partisan coalition is a genuine constraint on radical economic reform. Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s commitment to overcoming that constraint is commendable. But the fact that Sanders commands the loyalties of a disproportionately working-class 16 percent of the Democratic-primary electorate scarcely qualifies as evidence that his appeal with non-college-educated voters is so powerful it can radically realign American politics. After all, Biden boasts even stronger support among nonwhite and working-class Democrats. Does that mean that nominating Uncle Joe would reassemble the New Deal coalition? Sanders supporters might dismiss the racial and socioeconomic diversity of Biden’s support as a product of mere name recognition. But Warren backers can play that card against Sanders too: In the last week, multiple polls have shown her not only gaining more non-college-educated and non-white support as her campaign rolls on, but actually outperforming Sanders with such voters.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

Regardless, the evidence that no Democratic candidate can drastically change the party’s class composition in the near term is considerable. The movement of non-college-educated white voters to the right — and college-educated white ones to the left — is not an exceptionally American phenomenon. Rather, it has been happening for decades across much of Western Europe. The left attributes this development to center-left parties’ myriad betrayals of their working-class constituencies in the neoliberal era. And that is certainly part of the story. But it is also the case that non-college-educated white voters in the West have, in the aggregate, long evinced a preference for restricted immigration in opinion polls. It’s conceivable that, irrespective of economic policy, the demographic shifts of the past three decades were bound to increase the salience of immigration in partisan politics and thus drive a significant portion of the white working class away from center-left parties with bases in diverse urban centers.

But whatever the origins of this development, there is little evidence that left-wing parties can rapidly reverse it by embracing more robustly class-conscious rhetoric and ambitiously redistributionist economic policies. When Britain’s Labour Party elected a democratic socialist as its leader and campaigned on its most radical manifesto in a generation, it gained a historic number of seats in the 2017 general election — by, among other things, flipping Tory-held districts in the wealthiest parts of London. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, the bulk of Sanders-aligned, working-class House candidates in 2018 did not have much more success at winning non-college-educated white voters than did centrist Democrats running in similar districts (Richard Ojeda notwithstanding). None of this means that the left must give up on uniting the bulk of America’s multiethnic working class into a single party. But it does suggest that such a project may require years of patient organizing (and demographic replacement), rather than the nomination of any particular presidential candidate.

If Kilpatrick and Sunkara overestimate Sanders’s capacity to realign American politics, they understate how much the Democratic Party can accomplish with its existing coalition. The U.S. economy does not currently serve the average college-educated voter very well. And most of the marquee items on Sanders’s agenda are in the objective self-interest of virtually all affluent suburbanites. Charles Koch may have little use for free public college, universal health care, more generous Social Security benefits, or child-care subsidies. But the typical upper-middle-class family does. Meanwhile, the indebted and underemployed millennial sons and daughters of the professional middle class are one of the most reliably left-wing constituencies in the country and make up no small percentage of Jacobin’s subscriber base and DSA’s membership. There are limitations on what this coalition can achieve. But in California, the existing Democratic coalition just secured subsidized health care for undocumented immigrants and employment rights for exploited “gig economy” workers, over the furious objections of multibillion-dollar companies. Under Barack Obama, meanwhile, it extended Medicaid to millions of people, likely saving nearly 20,000 working-class Americans from premature deaths. The lamentable shortcomings of Obama’s tenure do not nullify that achievement.

Sunkara and Kilpatrick are right to find no contentment in such marginal gains. But by projecting contempt for one of the voting blocs that made those gains possible — and asserting that the existing Democratic Party can “never govern” — they risk projecting an air of indifference toward such reforms and the working-class people who’ve benefited from them (an indifference that I know neither writer actually feels). Socialists must always guard against the impression that they are more invested in chasing an ideological abstraction than delivering concrete benefits to the exploited classes they claim to champion. As a wise (and/or violently racist and jingoistic) man once said, “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” For many Democratic-primary voters, expressions of contempt for the organization that represents their best line of defense against racist, reactionary rule can be deeply alienating. Which points to the most immediate strategic upside of Warren’s “inside strategy”: Polls have repeatedly found that Sanders attracts a relatively high level of disapproval or discomfort among Democratic-primary voters, while Warren boasts an aberrantly low one. This reality, combined with the intensity of elite Democratic opposition to Sanders, invites the question of whether Warren is the only progressive with sufficient breadth of appeal (among Democratic voters and power brokers) to prevent Biden from securing the nomination — in which case Sanders’s theoretical superiority as a general-election candidate or president would be moot. The answer to that question is far from clear, in my view. But it’s hard to see how Sanders can negate its premise without stepping up his “inside game.”

All this may read as an elaborate endorsement of Warren. But I do not intend it as such. That Sanders evinces more interest in radically revising American foreign policy is no small thing. Further, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara note, in a context where the left is materially weak, the personal ideological commitments of elected leaders take on a heightened importance. And there is no question that Bernie Sanders has a more deeply rooted ideological commitment to radical politics than does Elizabeth Warren.

But too many prominent arguments for Sanders’s superiority consist of easily debunked distinctions between the two left-wing candidates or blithely unsubstantiated assertions that Bernie is uniquely capable of fomenting a political revolution and thus of bending the Democratic Establishment and U.S. Senate to his will. The first mode of argument risks alienating undecided liberals and obscuring Sanders’s genuinely distinctive merits. The second threatens to replace rigorous reflection on the obstacles to radical change in the United States with magical thinking — and a much-needed debate over how to overcome those impediments with the recitation of rival dogmas.

Which would be unfortunate. In this country, optimism of the intellect is a luxury that no “Champagne socialist” nor “Patagonia progressive” can afford."

In the remarkable events of the last few days that have suddenly brought House Democrats together in determination to impeach the president, a name keeps coming up nearly as often as that of Trump. It’s “Biden,” as in presidential candidate Joe and his globetrotting son, Hunter.

Yes, the case for impeaching the 45th president is broad and deep. But for the moment, impeachment fever and the MAGA counter-fever it will inspire are dwelling on the story of Trump’s efforts to sink Biden by securing an investigation of Hunter by a foreign government. Trump failed to get the Ukrainian government to lower the boom on Hunter Biden. But his ultimate objective, ironically, could be nearly as well served by controversy over his likely illegal actions, which will keep the “Biden corruption” story in the news. It’s kind of a like a hurricane stalled on the coast, pounding unlucky residents who are suddenly the primary object of nature’s wrath.

No one, so far, has made a credible case that Joe Biden did anything directly to help his son in his career as a lawyer-lobbyist, a procurer of appropriations earmarks, and an international man of mystery — much less anything inappropriate. But clearly, Hunter benefited from his last name, and aside from questions about his business dealings in Ukraine and China, his personal problems will be catnip for hostile and even friendly media alike. Hunter Biden’s history of substance abuse, the allegations made against him by his ex-wife during an ugly divorce, and his relationship with the widow of his brother, Beau, have all been out there in the public record. But they will get fresh exposure so long as he is a figure, however peripheral, in the impeachment case against the man his father is trying to defeat. Obviously enough, Team Trump wants it to stay that way, which is precisely why Trump and his goon, Rudy Giuliani, were trying to drop a dime on Hunter Biden and smear Joe in the bargain.

Should Team Biden be worried about this problem, absent any real evidence of wrongdoing? It’s hard to say. His presidential candidacy has overcome more immediate blows, mostly concerning his friendliness toward bigots, his long Senate record with its questionable policy positions, and his tendency now and then to sound like an old man who has lost a few steps. His perceived “electability” is a powerful asset. And it won’t be that easy over time for Trump fans to hammer away at Biden for his son’s alleged missteps given the president’s own sketchy relationship with sketchy family members (not that fear of looking hypocritical is a major inhibition for most of them).

The main reason Hurricane Hunter could be a problem for Biden is the timing. The 2020 Democratic nomination contest is at a delicate point, with Biden very slowly but steadily losing ground as Elizabeth Warren’s candidacy takes off like a rocket. As recently as August 7, Biden had a 15-point national lead over then-second-place Bernie Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling averages. Now he has a lead half that size over Warren. More alarmingly, Warren now leads Biden in the polling averages for Iowa, and has nearly caught him in New Hampshire (where the most recent high-quality poll, from Monmouth, gave Warren an actual lead). If Biden loses in both these initial states, history says his candidacy should fail (Bill Clinton didn’t win in Iowa or New Hampshire either in 1992, but that’s partially because he did not contest the former state, locked down by favorite son Tom Harkin). There’s even trouble down the road in California (which is voting just a few days after South Carolina), where a new Berkeley IGS poll shows Warren leading Biden by nine points.

In this period when voting intentions are beginning to form, it’s not a good thing for Joe Biden that his last name is hourly in the news in connection with a corruption claim associated with the biggest story in politics: impeachment. Perhaps Democratic voters will actually gain sympathy for the former veep as the victim of a notorious Trump smear. But voters obsessed with electability could see this as a preview of Trump’s signature ability to drag his opponents right down into the moral morass that is his natural habitat.

AMITE CITY, La.— The float carrying Gov. John Bel Edwards passed by quickly, and the tossed beads and campaign cups — “Putting Louisiana First” — landed a few feet short of Randy Foulks.

Foulks, the 68-year-old owner of an air conditioning company, likes Edwards. But he wasn't exactly jumping for campaign swag.

“I'm disappointed that he raised taxes when he said he wouldn't,” Foulks said. “I know he's got a big heart for this state. He took the bull by the horns when that storm came through here. But it's the taxes, man. Something's got to be done.”

Edwards, who was elected governor four years ago in a rout, is seeking a second term in a state that has largely moved away from Democrats. He has stayed far away from the party's presidential race, angered local and national Democrats by signing a strict abortion limitation law and expanded Medicaid. But he's in a tight battle for reelection against two Republicans running as allies of President Trump and enemies of a 2016 sales tax hike.

""[People] may not agree with everything that we've done,” Edwards said in an interview. “But you cannot, with any justification, say that Louisiana's not better off. We are running surpluses now, not deficits. We have an uninsured rate that's lower than the national average. Now, who would have thought that would ever be possible in the state of Louisiana?”

Louisiana's Oct. 12 election will test whether a socially conservative Democrat can still get elected in the South — whether it's still possible to excite liberal voters, mollify conservative voters and hold onto a job. With abortion practically off the table, Republicans have attacked Edwards's support for LGBT nondiscrimination laws. With unemployment falling under 5 percent, they credit the president's tax cuts and ask why Edwards can't govern more like Trump.

“We're the only state in the nation that lost jobs in the last 12 months,” said Rep. Ralph Abraham, the leading Republican candidate, in an interview from the sidelines of a Louisiana Tech football game. “He's got to own this stuff.” The congressman, who like Edwards is a military veteran, was there for one of the game's multiple salutes to the troops.

Republicans, who dominate Louisiana's state legislature, always saw Edwards as an accidental governor. He won 56 percent of the vote against Sen. David Vitter; one year later, Hillary Clinton won just 39 percent of the vote in the state. In 2015, Edwards benefited from two factors that disappeared right after the election: the unpopularity of two-term Gov. Bobby Jindal and the candidacy of Vitter. The senator, who had won reelection after admitting to paying for prostitutes (“a serious sin in my past”), was particularly vulnerable to Edwards's character-first campaign.

“The choice for governor couldn't be clearer,” one of Edwards's TV ads declared. “John Bel Edwards, who answered our country's call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute's call, minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers.”

Edwards's two opponents this year, Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, have no such problems. Abraham's campaign has emphasized his work as a family doctor; Republicans call him “Doc” more than they call him “Ralph.”

The wealthy Rispone is running as an outsider, the closest thing state Republicans can get to their own Trump. Rispone has spent millions on ads attacking Edwards over “sanctuary cities” and even a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill; he's also gone after Abraham, dredging up an accusation that he used his salary to buy a plane instead of donating the income to charity. (The attack, previously used by Democrats, ignores that Abraham did give his salary to charity until congressional ethics prevented him from taking income from his medical practice.)

“I'm the grandson of legal immigrants, who worked hard and played by the rules” Rispone says in one of his omnipresent TV spots, drawling the word “legal” for emphasis.

If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff. Edwards has consistently polled north of 40 percent, with his rivals in the 20s. But Republicans like their chances with either Abraham or Rispone, who have tag-teamed Edwards as a tax hiker who can't be trusted on social issues. The strategy is twofold: hoping that Democrats are less enthused to support an antiabortion governor and firing up the Republican vote by warning of “sanctuary cites,” crime waves and a breakdown of gender norms in the state's schools.

“As a doctor,” Abraham says in one TV spot, “I can assure you there are only two genders.”

Edwards has responded by constantly reminding voters of why their taxes went up at all — Jindal had blown up the state's deficit and Republicans got on board with the tax hike.

“We had already cut higher education deeper than any other state in the nation,” he said. “We'd already raised tuition more than any other state in the nation. People know that. The economy wasn't working.” Edwards has stood behind a gas tax increase that's supported by a plurality of voters but stalled in the legislature. In the first debate, he made a lonely promise not to cut taxes “until we know that we won’t go back into a structural budget deficit.”

Medicaid expansion, which Edwards brought to the state by executive action, hasn't reshaped the race. Republicans have not said outright that they'd reverse it, even as they support a lawsuit led by Republican attorneys general that would rip up the Affordable Care Act. (Louisiana's attorney general, Jeff Landry, is simultaneously suing to kill the ACA and promising to protect its most popular components.)

Republicans are not running against Medicaid expansion per se, focusing instead on troubles with how it was implemented and on the theory that it's better to get insurance through private employers than the government.

“Look, I'm a family doctor,” Abraham said. “There are those that need that safety net. We will take care of those people. My beef is that we've got over a hundred million dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse, and we've got over 1,600 people on the Medicaid rolls who are making over $100,000.” Abraham and other Republicans have attacked the implementation of expansion while navigating around the implications: that they would knock Louisianans off the Medicaid rolls.

A bill banning most abortions, which won't go into effect unless courts uphold a similar one in Mississippi, took a toll on the governor's Democratic support. Karen Carter Peterson, the state party chair and a member of the Democrats' legislative minority, even singled him out for criticism. But it also deprived Republicans of an issue, and they've spent the final weeks of the race with a different message to conservatives: Edwards is too lenient on LGBT rights.

Abraham described Edwards as two-faced on abortion — “he has a Planned Parenthood operative as his secretary of health” — but had even more to say about the state conducting a school survey that asked children about their sexual orientation.

“We need to let teachers teach and let the parents be the parents,” Abraham said. “If they want to have that discussion with their children, that's their business. The state should have no role in that agenda of social experimentation.”

Edwards has defended his support for gay rights, arguing that opposition will backfire on his opponents. “Discrimination and prejudice are not Louisiana values,” he said, when asked to respond to Abraham. “I think you have a candidate whose campaign is failing, and he's desperate, and he's trying to go back to some of those social wedge issues that have been used successfully in the past. That is not Louisiana today.”

On Saturday, as Edwards walked around the annual Fried Chicken Festival in New Orleans, his coalition came into view. Chrishelle DuPree, 46, rushed over to get a photo with her governor, even though she'd hated the abortion law.

“Abortion should be a woman's right,” Dupree said. “I totally don't agree with the governor on that. But I won't vote against him because of the abortion law. I was really pissed at first, but he's Catholic, so I understand it, and I can't let get a Republican in office. The hell with that!”

Moments later, the governor took a selfie with Steve Beatty, 64, who'd voted for Edwards in 2015 and then for Trump in 2016.

“I'm a Christian, and I believe every life needs a chance, like the governor,” Beatty explained. “I heard Franklin Graham say the night before the Trump election: You're not voting for Trump, you're voting for conservative values. I feel that way about the governor.”

But Edwards never supported Trump; in the final stretch, Republicans hope for that to make the difference, and point out that no incumbent governor who was forced into a runoff has won it. While Abraham has been massively outspent, his plan to win the runoff was for national attention to swing to Louisiana, and for the president to throw in behind him. Asked about the revelation that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president for dirt on Joe Biden's son, Abraham called it “the liberal media grasping at straws,” something that would not play in Louisiana.

“I want him down here,” Abraham said. “I want him to come down to Louisiana and have one of those MAGA rallies. He's welcome to come as many times as he wants.”

No national Democratic figure would be so welcome in Louisiana. Edwards had cheerfully ignored the party's race for president. Asked about the debate the 2020 candidates were having about Medicare-for-all, he emphasized that the current system was working for Louisiana. Asked about the president, he said he had worked with him plenty.

“I already got more than I can say grace over on my plate,” he said. “He typically doesn't go in the states where he's not going to win, and so I think he would be reluctant to come here. I would remind you that Democrats last year nationwide picked up seven new governorships. And I think the president went to just about all of those states.”

ON THE TRAIL

On Wednesday, the president defended his decision to ask Ukraine's new president for dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter.

Joe Biden has responded in two ways: calling all of this ridiculous and trying to return the focus to health care. Apart from an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show and some tart statements, the former vice president has stuck to his previous campaign plan, attacking the administration for undermining the Affordable Care Act.

“Many Republican legislatures and governors are dodging their duties to their constituents by rejecting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion opportunity,” he said in a Thursday morning statement. When he has talked about the Republican attempts to investigate Hunter Biden, it has been to talk about how the president's party is afraid of him.

“The reason I’m being attacked is most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,” Biden told donors via speakerphone Tuesday night. “So I’m not at all surprised I’ve become the object of his affection and attention. The attacks on me, they’re going to come and they’re going to go and they’ll soon be forgotten.”

The willingness of Republicans to attack Biden, and justify the president's approach, is raising one of the most important political questions of the primary: Have Democrats figured out what to do when Trump attacks?

Up to now, the president has been less relevant in primary politics than expected. Liberal activists — from the Sunrise Movement to Moms Demand Action to labor leaders — have been driving the policy conversation; the president has made cameos by attacking “socialism” or amplifying stories that ran in conservative media, rarely reaching Democrats, who tend to tune him out.

But the Ukraine story is taking Democrats to territory that to them feels both terrifyingly familiar and worryingly uncertain. Some in the party wonder whether angry voters will rally behind Biden, seeing the attacks as evidence that Trump doesn't want to run against him. Some worry that Republicans could weaponize Hunter Biden the way that they once weaponized Hillary Clinton's private email server.

“There are some Democrats who have 2016 PTSD,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, one of Biden's first supporters in Congress. “There were legitimate questions with the way that Hillary Clinton handled her email server. But in this case, come on: We're talking about something completely manufactured by a president who just committed the crime of extortion.”

The fight between Trump and Biden is asymmetrical; the president is almost unanimously supported in his party, while Biden's lead in the Democratic primary was slipping even before the Ukraine story. Of the 275 congressional Democrats who are not running for president, just 21 have endorsed Biden.

That's more than have endorsed any other candidate, but it's a fraction of the support Clinton had at this time in the race; by the time news broke about her use of a private email server, a majority of congressional Democrats had already endorsed her. It was in their interest to defend Clinton, whom they always saw as the likely nominee. They are not as sure what will happen to Biden. Even though they believe him, and not Trump, they have seen the president make stuff up and get away with it.

So far, most congressional Democrats and several of Biden's primary rivals have condemned Trump and defended the former vice president. At an appearance in California, Julián Castro directly compared what Trump was doing to the endless negativity of 2016: “Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.” Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, said no candidate should amplify what the president was saying about Biden.

“All Democratic candidates need to stand in solidarity against President Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Vice President Biden,” Khanna said. “Trump will smear whoever the Democratic nominee is, and Democrats must be united in rejecting his tawdry politics of hate, lies and personal attacks.”

“I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,” Sanders said in Iowa on Tuesday when asked whether he had concerns about Hunter Biden. Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment. You guys write very perceptive articles on these things and I’ll let you make that judgment.” One day later, asked whether her own ethics plan would allow the children of vice presidents to take lucrative foreign jobs, Warren said “no,” then admitted that she had to check the plan again. Neither statement had much solidarity with Biden.

Democratic voters, meanwhile, don't seem to be moving. At a meeting this week of Story County, Iowa, Democrats, opinion of the accusations against Biden — not the substance, but the risk — dovetailed with voters' own candidate preferences. Lisa Heddens, a 55-year-old supervisor, said it was deeply sad to see Biden’s family come under attack. She’d gotten to know the former vice president years earlier, when he got to know her son, who had an intellectual disability.

“He called my son when he was in the hospital. He invited us to the inauguration,” said Heddens, a longtime state legislator. “It is going to be a nasty, nasty election. But I think most of the electorate, most of the people, are tired of this stuff. And I think Joe, in particular, is in a good position to push back against it.”

But other Democrats, with fresh and painful memories of 2016, were more worried. Janet Wahl, 74, said at the same gathering that one reason she was supporting Warren over Biden was that she wanted “new blood” and hated to see Biden dragged into the fray.

“I feel it's horrible to do to anybody, and it’s horrible to do to him in particular,” Wahl said. “But Joe knew what he was getting into. He stepped up to do this again, and he knew how dirty politics could be.”

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, “Your Choice.” The Indiana Democrat's third Iowa spot conceals a negative message inside a positive one. “If you’re happy with the private insurance you’ve got, my plan would let you stick with it — if you want,” he says. “Now, others say it’s Medicare-for-all, or nothing.” This is the third ad Iowans will have seen from a presidential candidate warning them against Medicare-for-all. A spot from Joe Biden cryptically referred to politicians who want to “scrap” the Affordable Care Act, and one from Michael Bennet warned that ending private insurance “makes no sense.”

Tom Steyer, “Village.” The investor-turned-politico's latest ad emphasizes the need for Democrats to flip the Senate, name-checking two Republicans on the ballot next year (Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham) and one who isn't (Chuck Grassley). “It takes an entire village of politicians to rig the system,” Steyer says. “That’s why we need term limits; to make Washington work for you.” Term limits are part of Steyer's government change agenda, alongside national ballot measures that would let voters decide major issues; they have not recently been popular with Democratic voters.

California Democratic primary (Berkeley IGS, 2,272 likely voters)

Of several recent polls that have shown Elizabeth Warren battling Joe Biden for the lead in their primary, this might be the one with the most Warren-friendly news. The reason: California is the first racially diverse primary state where she has shown strength and where neither of her closest competitors has a dominating lead with nonwhite voters.

Here, Warren leads the field by 18 points among white non-Hispanic voters and by 14 points among Asian Americans. Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent. (Harris, whose mother immigrated to the United States from India, polls at only 5 percent with Asian Americans.)





Would you be excited if this candidate became the Democratic nominee? (Quinnipiac, 561 Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 70%

Joe Biden — 56%

Bernie Sanders — 55%

Kamala Harris — 49%

Pete Buttigieg — 46%

Warren's strength over the past month has shaken up some of the story lines about her support and which voters she could or could not appeal to within a Democratic primary. Recent Quinnipiac polls had asked about who voters saw as electable or who had better policy ideas; the excitement question comes at that a different way and, for the moment, finds Warren doing well with Democrats she hadn't appealed to previously.

Among white voters without college degrees and voters making less than $50,000, the percentage of “excited” voters is, respectively, 69 percent and 67 percent; for Sanders, it's 52 percent and 62 percent. By a 60-point margin, white voters with college degrees are excited about a Warren nomination, which clicks with stories about her appeal to white, suburban liberals. The “excitement” margin among those voters for Biden is just seven points; by a 12-point margin, those voters say they would not be excited about a Sanders nomination.

2020

Bernie Sanders. He joined the UAW's picket line in Detroit on Wednesday, two days after Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden had rallied with striking workers, and ahead of a planned visit to a Reno picket line by Pete Buttigieg.

Joe Biden. He has continued to campaign against the Trump administration’s waivers that allow conservative states to limit access to Medicaid, in between attacks from the president about Ukraine; he also announced a wave of endorsements from Iowa teachers as part of “Educators for Biden.”

Kamala Harris. She’s opening a campaign office in Oakland on Sunday, after a wave of polls have showed her falling behind in her home state and even in the Bay Area.

Julián Castro. He’s turning a weekend in Austin, where the Texas Tribune Festival is being held, into a major homecoming: an appearance at a Latino turnout rally, a stop at a voter turnout bus tour, and a “women for Castro” brunch.

Michael Bennet. He’s also speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, interviewed by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.

Amy Klobuchar. She’ll be in Austin over the weekend for the Texas Tribune Festival and the Voto Latino turnout event.

Beto O’Rouke. He’ll round out the Texas Tribune lineup, sitting for a Saturday interview with MSNBC’s Garrett Haake.

John Delaney. He’s making another trip to Iowa, with six weekend stops in six counties in the central part of the state.

Marianne Williamson. She’s spending Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas, joined at one stop by Richard Dreyfuss, who will “offer remarks about the power of civics in American public education.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) after speaking to a UAW strike in Detroit on Sunday. (Anthony Lanzilote/Bloomberg News)

The race for labor's endorsement. Four years ago, as nearly every major union either endorsed Hillary Clinton's nomination or stayed neutral in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders got a lot of help from California. The Oakland-based National Nurses United got behind Sanders early and spent millions of dollars to support him; the smaller National Union of Health Care Workers, also based there, endorsed him handily.

This year, NNU hasn't made its pick yet, and the NUHW just finished an interactive endorsement process that ended with a split decision: Warren and Sanders. Candidates gave video interviews, then the union's 15,000 members voted online, with ballot space for three choices. Warren appeared on 61 percent ballots to 50 percent for Sanders, 34 percent for Kamala Harris, 32 percent for Joe Biden, 21 percent for Pete Buttigieg, and 12 percent for a true dark horse: Trump.

The split endorsement was mostly an embarrassment for Harris, who had won the union's support in her California races. It's also a good look at how the momentum of the race is affecting the endorsement process that most unions have only just begun. No candidate looks like a sure thing for the nomination, as Clinton did four years ago. Sanders, a dream candidate for labor in 2015, has lost ground against his rivals, one of whom (Warren) is equally appealing to some labor organizers. Sanders has made solidarity with workers a key component of his campaign, even using his voter contact list to drive support and attention toward strikes.

Still to be determined: whether unions with more conservative membership, such as the building trades, will follow more left-wing unions, or will find Biden's campaign more compelling.

Much has been made about Warren’s growing popularity with young voters — she stood in line for four hours earlier this month taking selfies with people who attended her speech near New York University. And while she is not polling as well with black voters as Biden or Sanders, she has growing support with the demographic, according to other polls.

As another friend and respected colleague comes out in favor of Warren, I recognize the black folk they keep polling who support Biden. But I don’t see them polling anyone who doesn’t.

But the lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said: “Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren’s rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes — even if it means things are harder along the way.”

AD

Seven out of 10 Democrats said they would be excited if Warren became the Democratic nominee for president in 2020. Fewer — 56 percent — said they would feel the same about Biden winning the nomination.

And the excitement is rooted in Warren’s left-of-center ideas — she has released dozens of plans on an array of topics, including universal child care and getting rid of the electoral college. Because of her left-leaning politics, some assumed that Sanders would be most at risk of losing his support to Warren. But this poll suggests that Warren may mostly be taking support from Biden — and that could continue.

AD

Warren is less well known than Biden. Only 9 percent of those surveyed haven’t heard of Biden, who served in Congress for three decades before becoming the vice president to America’s first black president. Nearly 20 percent haven’t heard of Warren.

This means there’s a good chance for an uptick in support for Warren. As more people become aware of who she is, there’s a chance of more people liking what she is saying — and keeping her at the top of the polls.

The revelation reflects the extraordinary tensions between the White House and the nation’s highest-ranking intelligence official over a matter that has triggered impeachment proceedings against President Trump.

The officials said that Joseph Maguire, who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday.

Of the 11 education secretaries (not including those who served in an acting capacity), three were K-12 teachers: John B. King Jr. under President Barack Obama; Terrel Bell under President Ronald Reagan, and Roderick Paige under President George W. Bush. The rest, nope. Several of them, however, did have experience teaching in higher education, and one, Lauro F. Cavazos, who served under Reagan and President George H.W. Bush, was president of a university.

But DeVos’s attitude about traditional public schools — she once called them a “dead end” — and her poor performance at her confirmation hearing in Congress, rallied Democrats against her, and she became the first Cabinet member in U.S. history to be confirmed when the vice president broke a tie.

Warren, a former teacher, went directly after DeVos in that same May email, saying: “I’ll just be blunt: Betsy DeVos is the worst secretary of education we’ve seen.”

AD

Her promise to hire a teacher as DeVos’s successor was met with support — and prompted several other Democratic candidates to say the same thing if they were to win.

So is hiring an educator as secretary an automatic slam dunk? This is the question that veteran educator Peter Greene explores in the post below. It first appeared in Forbes, and Greene gave me permission to republish it.

AD

By Peter Greene

One up-and-coming education policy idea that was first proposed by Elizabeth Warren, but has now garnered wider candidate support, is the notion that a teacher should be the next secretary of education. At last count, four major candidates were supporting some version of the idea. It’s an arresting and appealing idea.

AD

Betsy DeVos is widely seen as a controversial opponent of public education, and in many education circles, predecessors such as Arne Duncan (who served President Obama) were not much loved, either. Many teachers feel that the folks in Washington just don’t get it, so the idea of someone from the trenches who would, presumably, get it — well, it’s an attractive idea.

But is it a good idea?

The devil, as always, is in the details. The idea has been expressed variously as appointing an educator, a public school teacher, or “someone who comes from public schools.” That may seem pretty straightforward. It isn't.

AD

“Educator” is a loose umbrella term to cover anyone who has held an education-adjacent job: teacher, administrator, education advocacy group member, school bus driver, education-specializing lawyer, or real estate salesman who once opened a charter school.

AD

“Public school” is not a clear term, because charter advocates assert that charter schools (privately owned and operated schools fed with public tax dollars) are public schools.

Even “teacher” has become a fuzzy term. Teach For America has created a small army of “former teachers” who have only two years of actual classroom experience. Critics have directed lots of attention at TFA’s program that claims to prepare college grads for a classroom in just five weeks. Less attention has been paid to how TFA produces “education policy experts” who have only two years of classroom experience.

AD

Those TFA grads have moved into a variety of powerful positions, from leaders of large city school systems to heads of entire state public education systems to founders and heads of their own charter schools. And while some TFA grads have emerged from the program as solid career supporters of public education, some remain aligned with the kind of corporate education reform that is unsupportive of public education.

AD

In short, the candidates could appoint someone like controversial former D.C. Chancellor Michelle Rhee and honor the letter of their pledge. But it would not much alter the trajectory set for the department by past secretaries.

So assuming that the newly appointed secretary was an actual working public school classroom teacher, would that be a good idea?

A classroom teacher would face some significant hurdles. DeVos lacks experience in running a large, complicated organization, nor has she shown a great deal of aptitude in dealing with members of Congress. A teacher secretary would face similar challenges.

AD

Field expertise is not enough; anyone in that job will need either prior understanding or a crash course in how to actually get things done in D.C. Wags will suggest that herding a room of unruly children through math lessons involves a similar skill set, and there’s some merit to that. Teachers manage, organize and lead every day.

AD

But it also seems a legitimate concern that a classroom teacher transplanted to D.C. bureaucracy would have a great deal to learn about effectively navigating the halls of power. But similar transitions have been made. Jerry Oleksiak is a 32-year classroom veteran who is now serving as Pennsylvania’s secretary of labor and industry. We often assume that lawyers and businessmen can, of course, “do government.” Why not teachers?

What most appeals about the idea is the notion of someone in the nation’s capital positioned to say, “Here’s how that policy looks in a real classroom, and here’s why it’s a lousy idea.”

AD

It’s not just that a teacher would have power, but that a teacher would actually be listened to. But that, too, is a devilish detail. A cabinet office does not come with a guarantee of access to a Presidential ear.

AD

Selecting a classroom teacher does not guarantee a particular point of view. Among the millions of classroom veterans, one finds a variety of viewpoints (one in three National Education Association members voted for Donald Trump).

It’s worth remembering that although previous secretaries include a school administrator and a college professor, the one secretary who taught in a public high school was Rod Paige, who presided over the “Texas Miracle” that turned out to be a mirage, and who once called the National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country, a “terrorist” organization (but apologized for it later the same day).

AD

Coming from a public school background is no guarantee that someone is a public school supporter.

AD

What could be the best feature of a teacher secretary would be a willingness to listen to other teachers. What has been consistently frustrating about education reform policies coming out of Washington has been how little policymakers have consulted with actual experts who work in the field. Even when teachers have been involved, they have been carefully vetted and selected to be in tune with administration ideas.

The best the next secretary could do, regardless of where she comes from, would be to assemble a broad-based panel of actual public school teachers, consult them regularly, and listen to them. In a world in which real live teachers had better access to those in power than lobbyists do, we could spend less time worrying about what the secretary of education used to do for a living."

The retailer’s chief financial officer had just informed the board of directors that Overstock could not renew its insurance policy as long as Byrne was in charge. The CEO’s incessant broadcasting of his involvement in a “deep state” investigation had irreparably linked his personal life with the public company. On Overstock letterhead the week before, he claimed that he had romanced a Russian agent at the urging of the “Men in Black” — his term for federal agents — and effectively inserted himself into an international political scandal.

AD

AD

Now Overstock’s insurance provider had concerns about the company’s ability to “manage the CEO’s personality and public comments,” according to internal emails obtained by The Washington Post.

In his Aug. 22 resignation letter, dated two days after the anniversary party, Byrne said he’d become ensnared in “certain government matters” and that his “rabbi,” Warren Buffett, had advised him to come clean to the American people. Later that day, Byrne appeared on Fox Business wearing a “Make America Grateful Again” hat and claimed a federal agent had offered him $1 billion to keep quiet.

But he was obligated to come forward because, he told Fox, “This country’s gone nuts.""

AD

Byrne’s resignation capped an unconventional and controversial two-decade run at Overstock.com, a billion-dollar retailer best known for moderately priced home goods. But the company that revolutionized furniture-buying to become one of the biggest successes in e-commerce was now reeling from a series of missteps and diversions, leaving it with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses. The company’s flagship site had become an afterthought for Byrne, 56, who wanted desperately to sell it to focus on his cryptocurrency businesses.

AD

But perhaps the biggest bombshell was Byrne’s claims of entanglement with the FBI. In a corporate news release last month, Byrne said he had been assisting federal agents in their investigation of Russian election interference through his three-year relationship with Maria Butina, the accused Russian agent.

Overstock shares fell 36 percent within days of the news release as anxious investors absorbed Byrne’s accounts of political intrigue, espionage and, in his words, a “handful of trysts” with Butina. The board was losing patience, and its chair, Allison Abraham, had begun forwarding hate mail to him, he said. Abraham did not respond to a request for comment.

AD

Soon Overstock’s insurance carrier was expressing reservations about renewing its liability plan for directors and officers, a scenario that corporate insurance experts say is highly unusual.

AD

“I’ve heard of companies that are too toxic to touch, but for one individual to be a liability risk for the whole company? That’s pretty extraordinary,” said Dan Bailey, an Ohio-based lawyer who has been drafting such policies for more than 30 years. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before.”

Internally, executives explored whether they could get a policy that covered all directors and officers except Byrne. When it became clear they couldn’t, Byrne says, he knew it was time to walk away.

AD

“I figured that when one is having to parse finely what ‘impossible’ means when it comes to getting insurance, it was time to leave,” said Byrne, who spoke to The Post by phone and through more than 80 emails over three weeks.

***

Overstock was designed to keep its shoppers guessing.

The site began as an online flea market where wholesalers could offload just about anything, including exercise machines, bedsheets and Star Wars figurines.

AD

The company got its start in 1999, at the height of the dot-com boom, when Byrne took a $7 million stake in D2: Discounts Direct, an online outlet for excess inventory and relaunched it under the new banner. It grew rapidly: Annual revenue catapulted from $1.8 million in 1999 to $25.5 million in 2000. By 2002, the company saw $92 million in revenue and turned its first quarterly profit.

AD

“In many ways, Overstock revolutionized e-commerce,” said Stormy Simon, who started working for the company in 2001 and was its president from 2013 to 2016. “We were the first to ship couches and huge rugs across the country. There wasn’t a lot of competition — it was just us, Amazon and eBay.""

Many of the company’s early practices have become standard in online shopping. Overstock was a pioneer in “drop shipping,” in which companies cut out the middleman by allowing third-party vendors to ship directly to customers. Meanwhile, its Club O membership program — introduced in 2004, a year before Amazon Prime — allowed shoppers to pay a flat fee for a year’s worth of free shipping. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Post.)

AD

By the mid-2000s, though, new competitors emerged. Overstock moved to improve efficiency and invested heavily in updating its computer systems. But it ended 2005 with $25 million in the red. A year later, losses widened to $97 million.

AD

Its stock also was in free fall, shedding about 80 percent of its value from 2005 to 2007. Byrne attributed that decline to systematic problems on Wall Street, including naked short-selling, in which investors bet against a company’s stock without having borrowed shares. It was all part of a wide-ranging Wall Street scheme, he told investors in a 2005 conference call, that involved “miscreant” hedge funds, high-profile journalists and the SEC. He claimed someone called “the Easter Bunny” had clued him in on the conspiracy, and that it was being overseen by a “Sith Lord,” a reference to a Star Wars villain. (In later interviews, he compared the network of “miscreants” to al-Qaeda.) Although the comments raised eyebrows, the company’s board made no public effort to rein him in.

“I listened to that conference call with my jaw on the floor,” said a former executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal affairs. “But of course nobody pushed back. Everyone was working for Patrick. It was his company, and that was it.”

AD

Byrne became more outspoken over time and sought a bigger platform. He started a website, DeepCapture.com, where he laid out his views and frequently took aim at former colleagues, journalists and hedge fund managers. (In a recent high-profile libel suit, a Canadian judge ordered Byrne and his site to pay nearly $1 million to a Vancouver businessman after DeepCapture accused him of being an arms dealer and terrorist.)

AD

But the campaign also drove his multimillionaire father, John Byrne, to resign from Overstock’s board. The man widely credited with rescuing Geico from bankruptcy in the 1970s said at the time that he disagreed with his son’s “jihad” against Wall Street. (He rejoined the board four years later, saying his son had been “right all along.”)

“It became all about, ‘I’m going to take down Wall Street,' and that became more important than the business,” said Simon, the former president. “Patrick just didn’t love retail after that.""

AD

In 2007, Byrne sued nearly a dozen major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, for $3.5 billion, alleging that a “massive, illegal stock market manipulation scheme” had driven down Overstock’s share price. Several of the banks settled out of court in 2010, for a collective $4.4 million. Merrill Lynch’s case extended into 2016, when it agreed to a $20 million settlement. (He also collected a $5 million settlement from Rocker Partners, a hedge fund he claimed was manipulating the company’s stock.)

AD

“The lawsuits ended successfully,” a spokesman for Overstock said. “And the regulatory changes advocated by Overstock lessened the debilitating consequences of the 2008 financial crisis to some of the largest banks in this county.” That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned “abusive naked short selling.”

Byrne said he personally bankrolled the $30 million for his “mitzvah with Wall Street,” which former employees say began taking priority over the company. “The oligarchy picked a fight; I clubbed them like a little baby seal,” he said in an email. “It was an honor to be able to put that wealth to such good purpose.”

Byrne’s deep distrust of Wall Street lingered. Until a few years ago, the company kept $10 million in gold and silver coins, along with enough food to feed its employees for three months (the stockpile is now down to a few weeks). “Why? To make our firm robust in the face of a number of social ills that could beset our nation,” Byrne said in an email to The Post.

The company also invested heavily in blockchain, the technology behind digital cryptocurrencies. It began accepting bitcoin in 2014, making it the first mainstream retailer to do so, and has continued to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Medici Ventures, its blockchain investment business, and tZero, its trading platform for digital coins. (That part of the business has been the subject of a years-long investigation by the SEC, though executives have said there has been no indication the agency plans to pursue legal action. The SEC declined to comment.)

Byrne has long confounded those around him. He has a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University and a black belt in taekwondo. Much of his world view, he has said, was shaped by three bouts with cancer, starting with a diagnosis of testicular cancer in his early 20s.

Internally, Byrne was known for having grandiose plans and a short attention span, according to interviews with former employees and executives, and one former board member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the company candidly. Byrne relied heavily on an insular group of executives who referred to themselves as “coyotes” and rarely challenged his views, several of them said.

Byrne left his mark on every part of the company: Its newest headquarters was designed to look like a peace sign from above, and like a “corporate version” of the Roman Colosseum from ground level, according to a company release. He also helped create an internal voting system that allowed employees to weigh in on company decisions, such as whether Snoop Dogg should perform at the office or who should be fired.

In recent years, Byrne had been trying to sell Overstock’s retail business, setting up meetings with Walmart, Target, Home Depot and the furniture rental company Aaron’s, according to a person involved in the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were not public. Representatives for the four retailers declined to comment, as did Overstock.

Byrne said he had hoped to sell the retail business in an auction scheduled for March 8, 2018. But days earlier, the company disclosed that the SEC was investigating its blockchain business. Almost immediately, “everybody backed out,” Byrne said, and the company was forced to put its plans on hold. Overstock has yet to find a buyer.

Meanwhile, Byrne doubled down on bitcoin, pouring his ambitions and money into blockchain technology and start-ups — which is what led him to Maria Butina.

***

Their story began at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.

It was 2015, and Byrne had just given a speech about cryptocurrency at FreedomFest, an annual meeting of libertarians that attracted such speakers as Donald Trump, Steve Forbes and Peter Thiel. He said he quickly noticed a “striking redheaded young woman” waiting to speak with him.

Butina introduced herself as the president of a gun rights group in Russia and handed him her business card, Byrne wrote on DeepCapture.com. The next day, she approached him again, with a different card. This one identified her as a special assistant to the vice chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. “Dr. Byrne, please allow me to tell you why I am really here,” she said, according to Byrne. “I have been sent here to make contact with you.""

Butina’s attorney, Robert Driscoll, disputes Byrne’s version of events: “She wasn’t sent to the U.S. by anybody, and she certainly wasn’t sent to the U.S. to make contact with Patrick,” he said, though he confirmed that the two had a romantic relationship.

Byrne invited Butina to his hotel suite for a lunch meeting. Butina told him she was being groomed to become the next president of Russia, Byrne said, and invited him to Moscow to speak about bitcoin at the Russian Central Bank.

Byrne said he then contacted federal authorities and asked whether it would be okay to accept Butina’s invitation to Russia. It took weeks, he said, to get an answer but eventually he received a “green light” telling him to move forward. He had no expectation that their relationship would turn romantic, but Butina “swept me and my liberalism off my feet,” he wrote on Deep Capture. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment.

He said they spent a weekend together in New York, then met up every so often in different parts of the country. It reminded him of “Lost in Translation,” he said, referring to the 2003 film in which an aging actor played by Bill Murray and a recent college graduate played by Scarlett Johansson have a series of intimate meetings.

“We had a handful of trysts like that,” he told The Post in an email, “spread across time, in the background of the normal narrative arc of her life.”

In late 2015, he said, Butina told him she’d been given orders to make contact with the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. (Driscoll disputes this.) Byrne said he reported this to “the Men in Black.”

Two former FBI special agents deemed the claims improbable. It’s unlikely, they said, that a highly trained foreign agent would have revealed her targets — in this case, as Byrne says, the four political campaigns — or that the FBI would have approved a romantic relationship as a means to collect intelligence.

They also dismissed Byrne’s claims that his 2015 phone calls helped spearhead the massive investigation into Russian election interference that culminated in a sprawling, $32 million inquiry by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Byrne said he was never contacted by Mueller’s team.

“There are a lot of steps it seems he’s not aware of,” said John Iannarelli, a retired FBI special agent, who called Byrne’s claims “ridiculous.” “Nothing he has said indicates that he understands how procedures operate.”

When asked why Butina might have revealed her alleged orders, Byrne said she did so while she was “heavily ‘under the influence’” of “large quantities” of serotonin, oxytocin and dopamine — the brain chemicals that spark feelings of love and attraction.

Byrne claims his history with the FBI dates back to 2002, when his friend and former NBA player Bison Dele disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. Byrne wrote on Deep Capture that he had a “minor involvement in helping the authorities sort it out.” (Dele has never been found; authorities believe he and two others were killed by his brother.)

As for Butina, Byrne said that he was under the impression he was receiving orders from top FBI officials. Six months into the relationship, Byrne said, the bureau asked him to break up with her. And he did — by text.

Soon though, Byrne says, the “Men in Black” returned with another request: “They wanted to ask me to rekindle a romantic relationship with Maria Butina,” he wrote on DeepCapture. “Russia was trying to subvert our election, and I was to get to the bottom of Maria Butina. ‘Gloves off.’”

Byrne says he obliged, setting off a chain of events that led to his departure.

***

Byrne is out — but the turmoil at Overstock remains.

On Monday, the company revised down its earnings forecast for the year — in part because of “significantly” higher insurance costs for directors and officers — and announced that its chief financial officer had resigned. Its share price has tumbled about 20 percent this week.

Former employees say Overstock’s retail site has become overly dependent on sweeping discounts and antiquated ideas. They expressed doubts that the new CEO, Jonathan Johnson, a company veteran who most recently led Overstock’s blockchain arm, would be able to steer the business in a new direction.

“I’ve been shoulder-to-shoulder with Patrick for 17 years,” Johnson, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Utah as a Republican in 2016, said in an interview. “If Patrick’s the architect, I’m the builder.”

In practical terms, Johnson says, that means Overstock.com — synonymous for many with bed frames and bath towels — could soon become solely a blockchain company. “If the right fit comes along at the right price, well, we could find another home for retail,” he said.

The company’s e-commerce business has faced mounting competition in recent years, not just from rival websites, but also more traditional retailers like Walmart and Target that are doubling down on home goods and furniture. Overstock’s largest competitor — and the one that seemed to most vex its executives — was Wayfair, a company that regularly posts hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses but has attracted large-scale venture capital funding and has eclipsed Overstock in revenue and market share. Last year, Wayfair posted a loss of $504 million, more than double Overstock’s $218 million loss.

Wayfair’s growing market share, former executives said, was a frequent source of tension within Overstock. And although Byrne’s departure may have helped the e-commerce giant insure its executives in the short term, they say they’re still worried about the company’s long-term prospects.

“You look at it now, and the retail business just isn’t loved anymore,” Simon said. “If you’re not going to feed the baby, you should at least give it up for adoption.”

***

Byrne is now on an island in Asia, he says, waiting for the whole thing to blow over. He says he has a duty to distance himself — both physically and financially — from the company he started 20 years ago.

He has gold and silver reserves in Switzerland, though he is becoming worried about “the deteriorating world situation.” Last week he sold his entire stake in Overstock — worth $90 million — and is reinvesting some of it in gold, silver and two types of cryptocurrencies, to shield his fortune from “acts of retaliation from the Deep State.”

“That is important because, in fact, I am now going to shellac them,” he wrote on his blog. “Actually, ‘shellac’ is too weak a word for what I intend to do to the Deep State. Sit back and enjoy the show.”"

The evidence of his abuse of government power and his willingness to betray the American democratic process is so obvious that Democrats need not fear they will be framed as “overreaching.”

This new political reality creates all sorts of challenges for Republicans. However, it also introduces a wild card into the Democratic race. I do not mean that this could adversely hurt former vice president Joe Biden. Trump’s wrongdoing is so egregious and Biden’s innocence is so widely accepted that the “flip the script” tactic cannot work in this case. (Indeed, candidates seen to be taking advantage, or suggesting there is something “there"" there, are likely to get bashed.)

Rather, the prospect of a Trump nomination on life support, or even a non-Trump nominee, should force us to reexamine the entire “electability” issue. The premise for the electability question is that Democrats need someone who matches up favorably against Trump. By the time we navigate through impeachment, virtually any of the current candidates (well, maybe not Tulsi Gabbard) could stack up favorably against a president willing to sell out American democracy. The entire definition of “electable” changes if there is no Trump or a badly battered Trump.

For one thing, the obsession that, with Trump, the Republicans have the secret sauce for winning the Upper Midwest will finally die, I would hope. I have made the case that an old white guy to compete against Trump to get other old, cranky white guys in Wisconsin is a ridiculous theory of electability. It makes just as much if not more sense to find a candidate that can excite African Americans, suburbanites and the college-educated. (It is also just as logical to find a candidate with the capacity to win in the Sun Belt.) If Trump literally isn’t there, or if a shadow of the old Trump runs, then Democrats can greatly expand the map and look for candidates who might even win states such as Texas.

Moreover, to the extent candidates have made their campaign about beating Trump, the absence or diminution of Trump poses a real dilemma. Here, Biden does have a challenge. He has told us that the deciding factor for his run was Charlottesville. He is running for the “soul” of the country, to prevent another four years of Trump. Would he have decided to run at all had Trump not been president? Not according to the narrative he is currently using. If he wants to stay in the race without the Trump target, he might need to shift his rationale somewhat. (He can still argue that Trump has made such a mess that the country needs an experienced hand to clean it up.)

On one hand, a diminished or absent Trump might boost Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Hey, we can take a bigger risk with her as the nominee! On the other hand, without a fully-charged Trump, perhaps her prairie populism is not needed, and could simply scare off winnable moderates.

The candidates best positioned for a weakened Trump or a non-Trump nominee likely are those Democrats who have explicitly said that America’s problems did not start with Trump and that the campaign must not be all about Trump. The obvious contender in this category would be South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who says he wants to turn the channel and make the campaign about generational change.

At any rate, Democrats should plan for either eventuality — a run against Trump (even a damaged one) or a run against a more garden-variety Republican. It is way too soon to count Trump out, but it’s not too soon to start planning for the possibility he might not be the nominee.

Medical-related debt is the top reason Americans file for bankruptcy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to erase much of that debt in his latest ambitious plan to reshape the country’s health-care system.

But the way he’s proposing to do so may be logistically unworkable — and wouldn’t necessarily benefit the people who need help the most, experts say.

Over the weekend, Sanders pledged that as president he would wipe out $81 billion in past-due medical bills reported to credit agencies such as Equifax. He’s also proposing to replace private credit agencies with a government-run one that ensures medical debt never hurts people’s credit scores.

“The very concept of medical debt should not exist,” Sanders said in a statement. “In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, one illness or disease should not ruin a family’s financial life and future.”

Top Sanders aide Warren Gunnels:

The U.S is the only major country on earth where you can lose your house, car or have your wages garnished because you can't afford to pay a medical bill. That's unconscionable & unacceptable. When Bernie is president we're going to #EliminateMedicalDebt. https://t.co/1KbhvAcufZ — Warren Gunnels (@GunnelsWarren) September 21, 2019

Nick Coltrain, politics reporter for the Des Moines Register:

Sen. @BernieSanders recounts hearing from a veteran in Carson City, Nev., who was suicidal over $100K medical debt. Calls medical debt unconscionable.

""This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. If we were a poor country, I'd be telling you something else."" — Nick Coltrain (@NColtrain) September 22, 2019

Sanders is right about this: Medical debt is a massive problem for Americans. That was true before the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and it remains a huge problem now.

Medical expenses are a contributing factor in two-thirds of individual bankruptcy filings. In a 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, more than a quarter of U.S. adults ages 18 to 64 said they or someone in their household had problems paying medical bills in the past year.

So it's not surprising many people hailed Sanders's proposal as a well-intentioned goal. The president of the American Federation of Teachers:

Medical debt is a huge problem. That's why nurses, including @minurses have fought to lower debt and have paid off the debt of patients. Glad to see @BernieSanders talking about medical debt as a part of his campaign. #AFTvotes https://t.co/tr6QSue7Y5 — Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) September 22, 2019

The proposal from Senator Sanders to eliminate medical debt illustrates that health policy is as much about financial security as it is about access to care. — Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) September 23, 2019

Vox editor-at-large Ezra Klein:

Of the various kinds of debt you can eliminate, I think the case is strongest for medical debt. That's not a voluntary investment people are making in their future. It's, usually, a catastrophic interaction of bad luck and bad (or no) health insurance. https://t.co/dalUu9ZgNq — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) September 23, 2019

Erasing $81 billion in medical debt would certainly be good for those who owe it. But it's a lot trickier than it sounds for the government to find it, the founder of a charity that buys and sells medical debt told me. And it wouldn’t wipe out the problem — not even close.

Craig Antico leads a charity called RIP Medical Debt, which negotiates with hospitals to buy medical debt. Because so many medical bills go unpaid — and the problem has only gotten worse as insurance plans have required increasingly high deductibles from patients — he’s typically able to buy debt for just pennies on the dollar.

That’s good news for Sanders’s ambitious plan. Antico estimates that buying $81 billion in medical debt might cost as little as $500 million for the federal government.

But to buy up that debt, the government would have to figure out which hospitals are owed the $81 billion reported to credit agencies. And that information is protected by strict privacy rules credit agencies must adhere to.

“It’s definitely a worthy goal to abolish this debt,” Antico said. “It’s how do you find it?”

Antico provided an example: If the government wanted to abolish medical debt for everyone who lives in, say, New York state, it would have to go to every hospital and doctor's group that might have cared for a state resident and engage in a separate negotiation with each of them. So finding who holds the debt reported to credit agencies is harder than it sounds.

""If Bernie Sanders came to us and said 'I need you guys to abolish $81 billion in debt,' he couldn't direct it to that particular group,"" Antico said.

Plus, only a small fraction of total medical debt — less than 10 percent, according to Antico's estimates — is actually reported to credit agencies. So even if the government succeeded in erasing the $81 billion estimate, hundreds of billions more would remain. That debt would continue hurting those who owe it, as they would be less likely to visit hospitals even in dire need.

And there’s this: Targeting only medical debt reported to credit agencies carries an inherent bias toward patients who have more financial means. Patients who are poorer and could benefit more from having medical debt erased tend to have less or no credit history. Antico's charity focuses on patients who need help the most by going to hospitals and asking to buy the debt of those who might have qualified for financial assistance and didn't receive it, or those who are in bankruptcy.

Sanders didn’t go into detail about how he would approach these questions in a web page detailing his proposal. He also consistently overstates the number of people who go bankrupt every year because they can’t pay their medical bills (my Washington Post colleague Salvador Rizzo awarded Sanders three “Pinocchios” for this claim).

(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)

But Sanders’s proposal does make more sense when you consider it in light of his other health-insurance ideas. Under his Medicare-for-all plan, Americans would no longer incur medical debt because everyone would be covered under a universal plan requiring almost no out-of-pocket payments upon getting medical care.

Sanders's vision is to erase outstanding medical debt so the slate could essentially be wiped clean under a new single-payer system, said David Himmelstein, a professor at CUNY’s Hunter College. Sanders has relied on research conducted by Himmelstein, who has worked on the topic with Sanders’s Democratic rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).

“If you’re saying that we’re gonna stop having financial ruin from medical bills in the future, it makes sense to say ‘let’s go back when the cost is relatively small and not let people be ruined by their medical debts from their past,” Himmelstein told me.

Yet, like Medicare-for-all, the proposal would undoubtedly meet with strong resistance from the behemoth health-care industry. Industry lobbyists argue that erasing medical debt would discourage Americans from purchasing health insurance, because they would be sheltered from it no matter what.

“Paying off everybody’s debts is great campaign rhetoric. As soon as you get into the details, a lot of things fall apart,” one industry lobbyist told me.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

A woman smokes on the street next to a wholesale vape shop in downtown Los Angeles. (Richard Vogel/AP)

AHH: Black-market vaping products may be behind the mysterious lung illnesses that have sickened at least 530 people in 38 states and killed nine, our Washington Post colleagues Lena H. Sun and Rob Kuznia report.

“Many sick patients said they bought vape products containing THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, on the black market, officials and clinicians said,” they write. “The biggest legal marijuana market in the world is California — and the black market there is three times as big, said David Abernathy, an executive with Arcview Market Research, a cannabis investment and market research firm.”

Recent changes to the ingredients in popular marijuana vaping devices could be the culprit, according to interviews with more than a dozen people working in the legal and illegal cannabis markets. California has tightened restrictions, making the product even scarcer on the black market. So illegal operators are using a thickening agent to dilute THC oil and stretch their supplies. One such agent — vitamin E acetate — has been the focus of investigations around the mysterious illnesses.

“No one product or substance, including vitamin E acetate, has been conclusively identified as the cause of the lung injuries. But vitamin E acetate has been found in THC products taken from sickened patients and tested by state labs and the FDA’s forensic lab, officials said,” Lena and Rob add.

— Meanwhile, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told lawmakers there have been “hundreds” of new cases of the vaping-related disease reported to the agency in the past week.

CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told lawmakers on a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee that more than 100 people are working on the investigation and that the “identification of the cause or causes for the outbreak may take substantial time and continuing effort,” as CNBC’s Angelica LaVito writes.

She also suggsted people may want to avoid vaping products until more is known about what’s causing the illness.

“At this point I think caution in all products is recommended. It may not even be the THC or the nicotine. It may be the additives or substances that may be common. It may be the material is not labeled appropriately,” Schuchat said.

OOF: Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) announced the state will ban all vaping product sales for four months, the toughest state crackdown issued in response to the vaping-related illnesses.

New York and Michigan have already announced bans of flavored products, and the Trump administration said its moving to set its own regulations to “clear the market” of flavored products. Massachusetts would go a step further by also temporarily halting sales of tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes, as our Post colleague Hannah Knowles reports.

“The purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,” Baker said in a statement.

OUCH: An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found a doctor-friendly approach to tackling surprise medical billing would deepen the deficit by “double digit billions,” the Hill’s Peter Sullivan reports. The analysis specifically examined the approach from Reps. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), that calls for an arbitration system in which insurers and providers would propose payment amounts and an independent third party would determine the ""fairer"" payment option.

In an email to a congressional office, Peter writes, the CBO said under Ruiz and Roe’s approach that if “payments to providers increased by 5 percent as the result of the policy, that change alone would result in a $15 billion increase in the deficit over 10 years.”

Meanwhile, the CBO has found the bipartisan bills that advanced out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee that use a benchmarking approach would save more than $20 billion over a decade.

— The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are set to drop 14 percent in 2020 compared with 2019 and 23 percent compared with 2018. The $23 estimated average monthly premium for the plans for next year will be the lowest average monthly premium for Medicare Advantage plans since 2007, according to the agency.

The average monthly premiums for these plans have decreased by almost 30 percent since 2017. For next year, the average number of plans per county is set to increase from about 33 to 39 plans.

The agency noted more than a third of the approximately 60 million Medicare enrollees are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan and that the number of people in the program is set to increase to a record 24.4 million, up from the current 22.2 million.

In a statement, CMS Administrator Seema Verma sought to contrast the success of Medicare Advantage plans with Medicare-for-all proposals — “proposals for a total government takeover of healthcare, which would destroy options such as Medicare Advantage that seniors increasingly choose,” Verma said.

— Pharmaceutical companies are upping their lobbying efforts and spending millions on ads to try to stop drug pricing bills they worry will dull their pricing power and markedly reduce sales, the Wall Street Journal’s Peter Loftus reports.

Industry players are hoping to at least stop any proposals -- such as the effort to peg U.S. drug prices to prices paid by other countries -- from passing this year, assuming lawmakers will be less likely to advance any plans in an election year.

But the challenge for these drugmakers is their diminishing political capital as concerns about high drug prices extend across party lines.

""Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans,” Peter writes. “They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the top trade group representing the drug industry, has spent $16.3 million on lobbying in the first six months of the year, compared to $28 million for all of last year.

President Trump's congressional agenda -- and specifically, the adminstration's top economic priorities -- may be the first casualty of the impeachment inquiry House Democrats just launched.

Specifically, a reworked North American trade pact — officially the United States-Mexico-Canada deal (USMCA), the administration’s top legislative priority — and a measure to impose new price controls on prescription drugs now face even longer odds this year. And the impeachment showdown raises the stakes for a potential government shutdown in late November, when stopgap funding Trump is expected to sign this week runs out.

The confrontation between the president and the House majority promises to be consuming, leaving little bandwidth or appetite for cooperation on other matters. “Not that there’s a ton now, but there’s going to be less,” says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research for Cornerstone Macro. “It’s hard to walk and chew gum when impeachment is one of those things. I don’t think they can multitask impeachment and a legislative agenda.”

Investors drew a similar conclusion. The S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day drop in a month, sliding 0.8 percent, as did the Nasdaq. And the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.5 percent after recovering some earlier losses. It was one of the most volatile trading day in weeks, as investors reacted to gyrations on the impeachment front while also absorbing gloomy news about consumer confidence and the U.S.-China trade war.

“Investors like gridlock, but they don’t like dysfunctional paralysis,” Stephen Myrow of Beacon Policy Advisors tells me. And impeachment “is raising the specter of dysfunctional paralysis,” a dynamic that could doom the USMCA, for example, while presenting new risks, “particularly in the event of a crisis.”

House Democrats haven’t foreclosed on continuing their everyday work while the impeachment inquiry gets underway. Via the Financial Times’s James Politi:

A spokesperson for Richard Neal, House Ways and Means committee chair, says he is ""absolutely committed to continuing"" the USMCA talks, ""regardless of any other congressional activity"" — James Politi (@JamesPoliti) September 24, 2019

But White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham signaled the administration will no longer work with House Democrats on matters of common interest. “In a far departure from all of the work and results of this President, House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks,” she said in a statement.

Trump sent a similar message in a tweet:

The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

Washington analysts who help decode political developments for Wall Street investors reported a heavy volume of calls as clients attempted to make sense of the latest turmoil. Analysts said even amid rapidly moving and highly uncertain circumstances, the implications for a corporate priority such as the USMCA al are clear enough.

“From a purely market perspective, I think the impeachment conversation is being viewed as just another dynamic that will weigh on market sentiment until there is clarity on both the resolution and the longer-term implications,” Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky said in an email.

Negotiations over the trade deal had showed signs of progress in recent days. Robert Lighthizer, Trump’s trade chief, was in talks with a working group of House Democratic lawmakers appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). They were trying to forge a compromise on Democratic demands for stronger labor, environmental and enforcement provisions — changes Pelosi demanded before agreeing to put the measure to a floor vote. “Before this weekend, USMCA was looking good,” one top House Democratic aide tells me.

But revelations about Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart — and pressure the president applied for him to probe former vice president Joe Biden— reset the fall agenda. In a sign of how dramatically circumstances have shifted, some freshmen Democrats from swing districts who had been agitating for a USMCA vote in part to have a bipartisan accomplishment to tout at home became the driving force for an impeachment inquiry. Public calls from that cohort to zero in on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine dissolved Pelosi’s months-long resistance to taking the next step against the president.

""Perhaps Pelosi will schedule a vote on USMCA this year, but that strikes us as a political bridge too far,"" Cowen Washington Research Group's Chris Krueger wrote in a note. ""Ratify Trump's signature trade achievement while calling for his impeachment?""

MARKET MOVERS

— Consumer confidence falls amid trade fears: “U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in September as an escalation in trade tensions fanned concerns about business and labor market conditions, a potentially worrying signal for consumer spending, which has been driving the economy,” Reuters’s Lucia Mutikani reports.

“The relatively downbeat survey from the Conference Board ... mirrors other confidence surveys and could renew financial market fears of a recession that had been assuaged somewhat by strong August retail sales, industrial production and housing data.”

""The overall measure remains elevated,"" Bloomberg's William Edwards notes. But the drop represented the biggest slip since the beginning of the year. And it was steeper than economists expected.

— Kashkari: The Fed is partially responsible for the slowdown. The Post's Heather Long: ""Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari says two factors are holding the U.S. economy back right now: President Trump’s trade war and high interest rates. The current U.S. interest rate is a bit below 2 percent after the Fed lowered it slightly last week. Kashkari would like to see the rate cut to under 1.5 percent to stimulate the economy.

""'I’m concerned that we’ve needlessly raised interest rates over the past three years and put the economy into a more dangerous position that makes it more vulnerable to shocks that could hit us,' Kashkari told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday. 'Why are we trying to contract the economy?'""

— Boris Johnson defiant after court ruling. Bloomberg's Tim Ross and Kitty Donaldson: ""A defiant Boris Johnson hit back at the U.K.’s top judges and vowed to take the country out of the European Union next month, despite suffering an unprecedented legal defeat over his Brexit strategy in the highest court in the land. In a sweeping rebuke to the prime minister, Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson broke the law when he decided to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the EU.""

What's next: ""The ruling marks an extraordinary constitutional moment and an unprecedented political crisis for the U.K. It blows a hole in Johnson’s political authority and calls into question his ability to remain in office as the Queen’s principal adviser. Senior politicians, including the former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, demanded that he apologize to Parliament. While the opposition was quick to call for his resignation, Johnson’s aides say he won’t go.""

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— Trump laces into China in U.N. speech. USA Today's John Fritze: ""Trump accused China of 'gaming' the global trade system as he defended tariffs that his critics say have put the U.S. economy at risk of a recession. He repeated long-held criticism that the World Trade Organization is giving preferential treatment to China.

""Chinese delegates sat stone-faced as Trump also briefly praised protesters in Hong Kong this year who are opposing Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. 'We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal,' Trump said. Trump said that while he wants a trade deal with China, he would 'not accept a bad deal for the American people.'""

Chinese foreign minister: ""Endless troubles"" if the countries delink. WSJ's Tyler Blint-Welsh: ""Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the so-called decoupling of the world’s two largest economies would have disastrous results and that China and the U.S. need to work cooperatively through their disagreements. Mr. Wang’s comments came as the U.S. and China remain at an impasse in a more than yearlong trade war, one that some analysts say could lead to a widening chasm between the two countries.

""'Decoupling from China’s economy would be to decouple from opportunities, and the future,' said Mr. Wang, who in the past has called the U.S.’s and China’s interests 'inseparable.'""

— Google, Starbucks fight E.U.: “Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Starbucks Corp. scored legal victories against European Union regulators,"" the Wall Street Journal’s Valentina Pop and Sam Schechner report, ""in court rulings that restrict the reach of the bloc’s privacy orders and deal a blow to its competition czar as she prepares to expand her regulatory powers.""

“The European Court of Justice ruled that Google doesn’t generally have to apply the EU’s ‘right to be forgotten’ to versions of its search engine accessed outside the bloc’s borders, though judges left the door open for European regulators to order it to do so in specific cases.”

POCKET CHANGE

— More workers to qualify for OT: “Workers making less than $35,500 are now entitled to mandatory overtime pay from their employers, under new rules announced by the Department of Labor. The new rules will take effect at the beginning of 2020,” my colleague Eli Rosenberg reports.

“The rules raise the salary threshold for workers for whom overtime pay — 1.5 times a worker’s typical hourly rate — is required from $23,600, a standard set in 2004 during the George W. Bush presidency. The Department of Labor under President Obama tried to raise the threshold to $47,000, a shift that would have given overtime pay to four million additional workers. But that proposal was met with strong opposition from business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republicans.”

— Saudis consider doubling history’s largest IPO: “After attacks on its oil infrastructure, Saudi Arabia is moving forward with the much-anticipated initial public offering of its state-owned oil company and considering a proposal to offer investors a much bigger stake in the company than previously planned, people familiar with the matter said,” the WSJ’s Summer Said and Julie Steinberg report.

“The Saudi Royal Court and its advisers have been debating an eventual float of as much as 10% of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, doubling the country’s longstanding public intention to list just 5%, according to these people. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ’s plan to expand what has already been billed as the world’s largest IPO suggests his often outsize ambitions are undeterred, even as the country’s oil giant attempts a full recovery from recent attacks on its largest facilities and faces risks to its valuation from subdued oil prices.”

— Pharma companies are ramping up their lobbying efforts: “Worried drugmakers are stepping up efforts to blunt proposals in Washington that they view as some of the most serious threats to their pricing power in recent years,” the WSJ’s Peter Loftus reports.

“Pharmaceutical industry trade organizations and outside groups are spending millions of dollars on advertisements attacking the proposals, which would peg drug prices in the U.S. to prices paid overseas and force companies to pay rebates if a drug’s price increases by more than the rate of inflation … Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans. They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

This quote: “We’re facing the stiffest political headwinds in the history of the industry,” James Greenwood, president of the trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, told the WSJ. BIO’s member companies include Amgen Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc.

— WeWork’s CEO is out: WeWork co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann ""was forced to step down and cede control of the shared-office startup after its much-anticipated initial public offering was derailed, capping a swift fall from grace for the leader of one of the country’s most valuable startups,” the WSJ’s Eliot Brown, Dana Cimilluca, David Benoit and Maureen Farrell report.

“Mr. Neumann will also cede majority control of the company, with his voting shares reduced to 3-to-1 from 10-to-1, the people said. The company earlier this month had reversed a recent enhancement to Mr. Neumann’s voting power that allotted him 20 votes for each share he held.”

The situation: “Mr. Neumann’s position at the company became tenuous after We postponed an IPO earlier this month amid concerns from prospective investors about its governance and ability to reverse big losses. That skepticism has placed a major dent in the company’s expected valuation, which has plummeted from $47 billion earlier this year to as low as $15 billion.”

— Hedge fun runs into Trump’s vaping ban: “Jason Mudrick has been enjoying a run this year that most other hedge fund managers only dream of,” Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan and Josh Saul report. “His flagship fund at Mudrick Capital Management is up 32% on soaring valuations for one of the largest players in the U.S. vaping market. Now, that same bet could pose a headache for the maverick investor.”

“About $800 million, or almost 30% of the assets overseen by his firm, are tied to E-cigarette maker NJOY Holdings Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mudrick’s controlling stake in the vaping venture has powered pretty much all of the gains in his flagship fund this year at a time when many other managers are posting tepid returns.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt..). (Nati Harnik/AP)

— Sanders calls for 8% wealth tax: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ""unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes,” the New York Times’s Thomas Kaplan reports.

The details: “Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan.”

His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan.” How it compares to Warren: “... While Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.”

“... While Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.” What the money would pay for: “Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for 'Medicare for all.' ”

“Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for 'Medicare for all.' ” But Sanders made clear the effort is also meant to be punitive: ""I don’t think that billionaires should exist,” he said. “This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that’s exactly what we should be doing.”

The chief of Better Markets, which advocates for strict regulations on the finance industry, wrote with some thoughts on yesterday's note detailing the rising alarm among Wall Streeters over Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) rise in the 2020 Democratic field. He zeroed in on an CNBC report explaining how hyper-rich married couples could dodge Warren's wealth tax proposal by getting divorced: ""The Wall Street-CNBC echo chamber is dangerously out of touch,"" Kelleher wrote in an email. ""After decades of redistribution from everyone else up to the .01%, the handful of unimaginably super-wealthy Americans with $2 BILLION are going to get divorced to save $10 million in taxes! Because they are going to have a hard time making ends meet on $1,990,000,000?""

On The Hill

WHY PELOSI CHANGED HER MIND: The speaker of the House “crossed the Rubicon,” in her words, when she announced late yesterday afternoon that Democrats would officially embrace an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

It was a defining moment for Nancy Pelosi and for the Trump presidency, one which was far from guaranteed. Just a week ago, Pelosi was cautioning restive members of her caucus to hold their fire on wielding impeachment, a blunt political tool brandished only four times in American history. But the speaker relented following allegations Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.

“The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said. “Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”

Pelosi said. What this means: “Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report.

“Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report. “Unlike any other caucus meeting, there was broad consensus — I did not hear one word of dissent, and that’s the first time that I recall that’s occurred in a discussion of the president,” House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) told reporters upon exiting a caucus meeting to discuss the historic move.

The speaker's change of heart was long in coming and fed by an array of new factors:

Groundswell from Democrats in swing seats: Over 20 Democrats — many of whom sit in competitive districts won by Trump in 2016 — changed their minds and came out in support of impeachment over the last 48 hours.

An overwhelming majority: As of this morning, 198 House Democrats have called for an impeachment inquiry, according to my colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips, and Kevin Schaul.

'Most understandable': Pelosi pointed out in an interview yesterday with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg that the new allegations — unlike, perhaps, the web of complicated charges in Robert S. Mueller III's report — could be clearer to the American public, which is so far not behind impeachment.

She said: “This is about the Constitution of the United States and we have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offense in terms of the Constitution, we would say … but this one is the most understandable by the public. And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained.

And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained. The bottom line: “We don't ask foreign governments to help us in our elections,” Pelosi concluded.

The Trump factor: Unlike other controversies plaguing the Trump White House, the president himself has suggested he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden multiple times.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Sunday morning. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

“NO quid pro quo”: In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.” Key: “The president of the United States admitted that he spoke to the president of a foreign country — that would be Ukraine — about something that would assist him in his election, Pelosi told reporters, according to Politico's Kyle Cheney, Heather Caygle, and John Bresnahan. “So that has changed everything.”

Behind the scenes: Rachael, Mike and Karoun report that Pelosi and Trump spoke on Tuesday morning in a conversation in which Pelosi informed Trump of her decision to launch an impeachment inquiry.

“Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions, according to individuals familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe the conversation,” per Rachael, Mike, and Karoun.

Pelosi replied that Trump had the power to turn over the complaint and challenged him to do so: “I said, ‘Well, then undo it.’ Undo it. Because you are asking the DNI to break the law. I mean, it’s just outrageous.”

Public polling?: Voters, to this point haven't been behind an impeachment inquiry. But the impact of the fast-moving Ukraine developments haven't yet been tested, said one Democratic pollster.

Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told Power Up in an email that while he doesn't have any new numbers “they wouldn’t mean all that much now anyway — this is a quickly moving target.”

Adopted by Unanimous Consent: S.Res.325 - Transmission of Whistleblower Complaint:

Expressing the sense of the Senate that the whistleblower complaint received on 8/12/19, by the IG of the Intelligence Community should be transmitted immediately to Intelligence Committee — Senate Cloakroom (@SenateCloakroom) September 24, 2019

NEXT STEPS: “White House and intelligence officials were working out a plan on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the whistle-blower complaint that helped ignite the impeachment drive against President Trump and to allow the whistle-blower to speak with congressional investigators, people briefed on the matter said,"" the New York Times's Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report.

“People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Schmidt, Barnes and Haberman report of the complain that was filed on Aug. 12.

Even the GOP-controlled Senate — in a rare bipartisan moment — voted unanimously for the whistleblower complaint to be turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

— in a rare bipartisan moment — voted unanimously for the whistleblower complaint to be turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The lawyers for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, released a letter to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on moving forward “to contact the congressional intelligence committees directly” to provide testimony.

“House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff said Tuesday that the lawyers had contacted the panel and testimony could be 'as soon as this week,'"" per the Associated Press.

Reminder: One very important person hasn't changed his mind. The Senate would ultimately have to try Trump if he is impeached by the House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was ""dismissive,"" saying “Speaker Pelosi’s much-publicized efforts to restrain her far-left conference have finally crumbled.""

At The White House

RUDY'S SHADOW UKRAINE AGENDA: “President Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists — including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani — to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said,” my colleagues Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima report.

“The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.”

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain.”

“Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official told my colleagues. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.”

one U.S. official told my colleagues. Read the full story here.

From the mayor: Giuliani responded to the story in a memorable appearance on Fox News last night where he claims that the State Department directed him to contact Ukrainian officials about Biden.

“I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it. And then I reported every conversation back to them. Laura, I’m a pretty good lawyer, just a country lawyer, but it’s all right here, right here. The first call from the State Department,” Giuliani told host Laura Ingraham, brandishing his cellphone to say he had proof of the contact.

How it all unfolded: Support for impeachment was not inevitable.

As our colleagues documented, the push began with the lonely Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) in 2017. Trump's actions, Mueller's Russia investigation and, finally, the whistleblower brought along successive waves of converts and increasingly a broader swath of the Democratic caucus.

Not even two years after Green's first efforts, they are now almost 200 strong.

Prior to Mueller's report being released, supporters were from some of the most liberal districts:

The redacted report's release in mid-April, Mueller's initial statement in late May and, finally, his testimony in late July began to broaden the base:

The Campaign

HOW THE 2020 CANDIDATES REACTED: Biden is not quite there yet, but he moved a lot closer toward endorsing an impeachment inquiry, our colleagues Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. report. As the early leader in the field, the former vice president’s opposition to impeachment has for months stood in stark contrast to nearly every other major 2020 hopeful --- including the nine other candidates who joined him Sept. 12 on the debate stage.

“If he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said in a brief statement from Wilmington, Del. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

The rest of the field mostly reiterated their previous calls for impeachment.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write.

“would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) wrote on Twitter, “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands.”

wrote on Twitter, “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands.” “To my former colleagues in Congress: Finish the job and impeach him,” former congressman Beto O’Rourke wrote on Twitter.

It will be interesting to watch the amount of pressure the group puts on Pelosi and House Democrats going forward. On Friday, Warren reiterated her call for impeachment that she first made in April by saying that Congress’ failure to act had made it “complicit,"" a statement that was widely viewed as a shot at Pelosi’s leadership.

The Policies

HOUSE HOLDS HEARING ON ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN: The Judiciary Committee will meet later this morning to consider the possibility of renewing the federal assault weapons ban, a controversial law passed during the 1990s that banned 19 types of semiautomatic firearms and magazines which held more than 10 rounds. But the law contained a sunset provision and Republicans were perfectly content to let it expire in 2004 --- Democrats also failed to make a serious push to renew it when they had control of Congress early in the Obama administration.

The witnesses: Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, whose city was the site of a mass shooting in August that left nine people dead; Alejandro Rios Tovar, a surgeon at the University Medical Center of El Paso, which experienced its own mass shooting just 24 hours before Dayton that left 20 people dead; and Charlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney. Dianna Muller, a former Tulsa police officer who works with a group focused on encouraging female firearm owners to tell their stories, will testify. As will Amy Swearer, a Heritage Foundation legal policy analyst who has criticized similar efforts to renew the ban.

That is tantalizingly close to the necessary 218, but as CNN's Ronald Brownstein and Aaron Kessler pointed out many of the holdouts come from the majority makers that flipped Republican-leaning districts in 2018. And the GOP-controlled Senate is disinclined to action as long as Trump hasn't put his cards on the table. (The White House has still not released its promised gun-control plan.)

The Investigations

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE: Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before Congress starting at 9 a.m. this morning (in open and closed hearings) about the explosive whistleblower complaint that has triggered a historic impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

The nation's top intelligence official will be grilled about his handling of the complaint concerning Trump's interactions with Ukraine and his asking its president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Democrats are expected to press Maguire to cough up details about why the complaint was withheld until yesterday from lawmakers and instead channeled to the Justice Department, where officials determined there was nothing to see there.

What DOJ did: Steven A. Engel, the head of DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, argued in a memo “that it was lawful for [Maguire] to refuse to turn the whistleblower complaint over to Congress — a stance that the Trump administration began to back off of as Democrats stepped up talk of potentially impeaching the president,” reported the New York Times's Charlie Savage, Michael Schmidt, and Julian Barnes report.

Per senior Justice officials, Maguire "" … made a criminal referral [to DOJ], passing to the department the inspector general’s concern that campaign finance laws might have been violated,” per The Post's Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett.

Last week : "" … the Justice Department decided there was not enough evidence to proceed with a campaign finance investigation. The decision, senior [DOJ] officials said, was made by Brian Benczkowski, who heads the Justice Department’s criminal division. They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision,” per Matt and Devlin.

New line of inquiry: “The intelligence officer who filed a whistleblower complaint about President Trump’s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint,” Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes report.

“The intelligence officer who filed a whistleblower complaint about President Trump’s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint,” Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes report. And: ""The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored,"" report my colleagues Matt, Devlin, Carol D. Leonnig and Shane Harris.

The anti-Corey Lewandowski: Maguire, his peers told Power Up, is expected to be the antithesis of Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager who last week turned in a mocking and brash performance on the Hill.

Despite his “acting” title, it's unlikely the acting DNI head will treat the high-stakes appearance as an audition for an audience of one:

“I can't imagine anyone who cares less about that — if he were acting, nominated, or confirmed, he will be the exact same straightforward guy, providing the answers the best he can,” Michael Leitner, the former head of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center director, told Power Up. “It's just an observation having worked with the guy.”

Democrats are expected to hone in on who exactly instructed Maguire to withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress against the urging of intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who determined the complaint was of “urgent concern.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) accused Maguire of not responding to the complaint in an appropriate or timely manner. But yesterday evening, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees received the complaint in full.

Maguire denied any wrongdoing in a statement released Tuesday:

“In light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,” Maguire said.

“I am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately,” Maguire added. “I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.”

The intelligence community, under attack from a president who has consistently politicized it, will also be watching closely:

“How do you square the talking points distributed from this White House with the reality of what the DNI and the intelligence community has said behind closed doors?,"" a Democratic House source asked Power Up. “Will Maguire note the massive contradiction or protect a president who has pitted the intelligence community against each other?”

“Everyone has seen the talking points from the White House and it's literally lies,” the source added of the talking points the White House accidentally distributed yesterday to Hill Democrats.

“The way Maguire has handled this situation has not endeared him to the people he's working with,” a former intelligence official told us.

Maguire was not Trump's first choice for the position: Trump initially nominated Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) to replace Dan Coats after denying then-deputy director Sue Gordon the job. Trump withdrew Ratcliffe's name, however, after concerns he was too political. Maguire's background mirrors what former peers described as a duty to protect the intelligence community:

“A former Navy SEAL, Maguire retired from the U.S. Navy in 2010 after serving 36 years. He was director of the National Counterterrorism Center before his role in the Trump administration,” CNN's Chandeleis Duster reports.

“… Maguire was viewed as a steady hand by Democrats and Republicans alike when he was named by Mr. Trump in August to be acting director of national intelligence after the president pushed his Senate-confirmed predecessor, Daniel Coats, to step down. The president also pushed out Sue Gordon, a career intelligence official who served as Mr. Coats’s deputy,” the Wall Street Journal's Warren Strobel and Dustin Volz report.

But the extent of the tension between the White House and Maguire over the whistleblower's complaint came to light yesterday: our colleagues Greg Miller, Shane Harris and Karoun Demirjian report that the acting director “threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.”

“The officials said that [Maguire], who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday.”

Maguire and the White House denied the story. However, “other officials said that Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it was going to assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July.”

Bottom line — or not: “How this surfaced and how it is now in the public is really a sideshow,” a source who worked with Maguire previously said. “This is about the president and the constitution now.”

At The White House

NOTABLE DEVELOPMENT: The whistleblower's ""identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint, the people said — adding that the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,"" the Times's Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes first reported.

The whistle-blower ""heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had 'abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,'"" according to a Justice Department memo ""which referred only to a single phone call between Mr. Trump and an unnamed foreign leader.""

On The Hill

🚨 218 MEMBERS: A majority of the House now supports opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to our colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips and Kevin Schaul's definitive list.

The numbers: 217 of the 235 House Democrats support an opening an inquiry along with one independent (Rep. Justin Amash, who was formerly a Republican).

217 of the 235 House Democrats support an opening an inquiry along with one independent (Rep. Justin Amash, who was formerly a Republican). Watch this: 25 of those members would go as far as voting today to impeach Trump. Remember, it takes a simple majority (218) to vote on articles and formally impeach the president but we are still a ways out from that step, if it does occur. The Senate would then have to vote to convict the president in order to oust him and we're still a ways from that, too.

RED WALL?: “Several Senate Republicans were privately stunned,” our colleague Bob Costa reports, as they “questioned the White House’s judgment after it released a rough transcript of [Trump’s] call with the Ukraine president that showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate [Biden].”

Not a good idea: “Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions with The Washington Post that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats,” our colleague writes.

Most Republicans, for now, however are not publicly questioning Trump's actions. But Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) publicly vented their frustrations.

“It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Romney said about the transcript.

Sasse speaks: “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no 'there' there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sasse told reporters after reviewing the complaint. “ … Democrats ought not be using words like ‘impeach’ before they knew anything about the actual substance.”

The Nebraska senator is an interesting case: He is up for reelection next year and faces a primary challenger. But after making waves early in Trump's presidency, Sasse was endorsed by Trump just last week.

The ones to watch: The trio of Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Susan Collins (Maine) are the GOP's most vulnerable incumbents next November, making them among the group of Republicans to watch for potential breaks with the White House. So far though, they and their colleagues are nowhere near that point.

McSally scoffed at the notion of impeachment: She deemed it a “kamikaze mission,” Politico's Burgess Everett reports.

She deemed it a “kamikaze mission,” Politico's Burgess Everett reports.

“I should make clear that if there are articles of impeachment I would be a juror, and as a juror I think it’s inappropriate for me to reach conclusions about evidence or to comment on the proceedings in the House,” she told reporters. And Gardner largely avoided commenting on the topic: “Gardner said Trump's conversations with the president of Ukraine about Joe Biden and his family as well as a whistleblower complaint about the president's conversations with a world leader are a 'serious issue,'"" Everett writes. “Asked if he still supported Trump’s reelection, Gardner declined to address the question: 'Let’s find out what’s happening. Let’s get to the bottom of this.'”

WHY UBER MAY NOT PRIORITIZE YOUR SAFETY FIRST: Investigators say Uber has a three-strike policy for drivers facing complaints, but that executives have overruled their own employees to keep high-performing drivers on the road. In some instances, that has meant overlooking allegations of sexual misconduct. Even when a driver is banned from the app, Uber does not report the behavior to police, its competitors or background check firms, our colleague Greg Bensinger reports in a bombshell story.

A former investigator says what it's really like: “Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Our job is to keep the tone of our conversations with customers and drivers so that Uber is not held liable.”

“Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Uber disputes its policies put the company first, but the story contains a number troubling episodes. ""For instance, a New York-area driver allegedly made three separate sexual advances on riders, said an investigator assigned to the case. After an executive overruled the investigator, the driver was allowed to continue working until a fourth incident, when a rider claimed he raped her,"" our colleague writes. Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police.

Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police. Lyft, in case you were wondering, has faced similar allegations: ""Interviews with Lyft employees indicate that the company also seeks to limit its liability for driver and passenger behavior, in part by deactivating drivers or riders. Earlier this month, 14 women filed suit against Lyft saying they had been sexually assaulted by drivers over the past two years,"" our colleague writes. A spokesman for Lyft said safety is ""fundamental"" to and that it works closely with regulators.

Here's why this matters: ""Many companies go to great lengths to limit their liability,"" our colleague writes. ""But gig economy companies fall in a new category where the question of their liability is still up in the air. There is a different standard of accountability than for the taxi industry, where cab companies generally maintain direct control over the condition and quality of rides and can therefore bear full responsibility for what happens during a fare, according to fleet managers.""

What happened: ""President Reuven Rivlin chose him to try to cobble together a coalition, opening the door to a continued shift to the right for Israel and offering a potential political lifeline to Mr. Netanyahu, who faces a looming indictment for corruption.""

He has pledged to include ultra-Orthodox Jewish factions, and that probably will deter potential secular partners,"" our colleagues Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report. ""He also has endorsed sharing power with Blue and White, but Gantz promised during the campaign never to join forces with Likud unless Netanyahu stepped down.""

A California lawmaker wants to hold ride-hailing companies accountable after a Washington Post investigation exposed that Uber went to great lengths to avoid liability for passengers' reports of sexual assault and harassment.

Lorena Gonzalez, a Democratic state assemblywoman representing San Diego, tells me in an interview that she’s now drafting legislation that would ensure Uber and Lyft properly investigate claims of sexual assault and harassment.

Gonzalez is considering mandatory reporting requirements for allegations of sexual assault after my colleague Greg Bensinger found Uber's internal investigators are forbidden to share them with law enforcement or other ride-hailing companies.

If a customer reports a crime, Gonzalez told me, it must be properly investigated. “There does need to be a responsibility to truly investigate,” Gonzalez told me. “That's clearly not happening.”

Gonzalez's plan to introduce legislation, likely in December, is just the latest sign that lawmakers are growing fed up with technology companies' excuse that they're just digital platforms -- and not responsible for the real-world problems that arise when people abuse their services.

Uber and Lyft have perfected this defense: They frequently argue that they don't employ the drivers -- but serve simply as the tech provider that connects them with rides -- so they can't be held accountable for their actions.

But Gonzalez says that if the companies want to take credit for creating a new way for consumers to travel, they also have to take the blame if people's safety is at risk.

“They're trying to have it both ways,” she said. “They're trying to suggest that they're creating this safe easy way for people to get around, but they want no liability when it comes to anything, whether it's work or pay or the dangers they're putting workers in or the dangers they're putting customers in.” Gonzalez is also considering requiring background checks of drivers to include finger prints.

Uber announced this morning it was rolling out a suite of new safety features amid the increased public scrutiny, including a new feature in its app which would allow customers to report uncomfortable situations like erratic driving and invasive questioning, my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports.

“The core principle for us here is, underreporting is a big issue in every industry and we want to be able to help with that,” Sachin Kansal, Uber’s head of safety products, said in an interview. “If a user has a bad experience, we want to hear about that.”

Though Greg's investigation primarily focused on Uber customers who reported sexual assault and harassment at the hands of their drivers, Gonzalez says she's also talked to drivers who have experienced sexual harassment while working for the companies. Any legislation she introduces will include protections for both drivers and customers.

Uber told Greg that it doesn't report its findings with background check firms, law enforcement, or other ride-sharing businesses because it wants to be “survivor-centric.” One executive told Greg that a survivor should be able to decide if they want to report their story to law enforcement.

“At the end of the day, we’re not the judge and jury to determine whether a crime has occurred,” Tracey Breeden, Uber’s global head of women’s safety, told Greg. “We’re here to gather information, make a business decision. We’re not law enforcement.”

Gonzalez, who has been leading the charge in California to require gig economy companies to make drivers their employees, says that change would give Uber and Lyft far greater liability for crimes that occur during rides. A bill she introduced requiring companies to reclassify workers essential to their business as employees — known as AB5 — was signed into law earlier this month.

However, Uber and Lyft are planning to fight the law. Uber has said it will not automatically reclassify its drivers as employees when the law takes effect next year because they are not essential to its business.

Given this broader dispute, Gonzalez says that California needs an additional law on the books specifically addressing sexual harassment and assault at ride-hailing companies to ensure riders and drivers are protected.

The concerns about the companies' handling of sexual harassment have also extended to Washington, where Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) is stepping up his oversight of the companies. He sent letters to both Uber and Lyft yesterday requesting information about their driver review policies. Blumenthal specifically said he was concerned about sexual harassment and assault, Greg reports.

Blumenthal told Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that he was “alarmed by Uber’s public statements about this issue, which indicate a brazenly careless attitude about your responsibility to your customers.”

BITS, NIBBLES AND BYTES

BITS: The release of the rough transcript of President Trump's call with his Ukranian counterpart has revived a conspiracy theory focused on the California cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which exposed Russian breaches of the Democratic Party's computers in 2016, my colleagues Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima write.

Right-wing corners of the Internet celebrated Trump's mention of the company in the July call. “CROWDSTRIKE IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS,” said one message on the Reddit's “the_donald,” a pro-Trump message board. In another Reddit thread, a person wrote, “Trump just put ‘Ukrainian CrowdStrike’ into the consciousness and conversation of every normie that is following this story.”

The vilification of Crowdstrike reflects how misinformation evolves in a complex media environment, ""mixing fact with innuendo before ultimately reaching the president — owner of the world’s loudest megaphone,"" my colleagues write.

“This is insane,” Robert Johnston, CEO of Adlumin and a former CrowdStrike investigator who worked on the probe into the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, told my colleagues. “This is absolute babbling to the president of Ukraine. It’s hard to finger exactly which conspiracy theory he’s subscribing to. But none of them have any grounding in reality.”

Trump has come to think the DNC server hacked by Russian intelligence agents in 2016 may have been hidden in Ukraine, people familiar with the president’s thinking told my colleagues. It isn't the first time Trump has embraced a conspiracy theory, but it wasn’t immediately clear how he reached that conclusion about the DNC server or how that would even have been physically possible, my colleagues note.

NIBBLES: The Justice Department plans to launch its own antitrust investigation into Facebook’s business practices, David McLaughlin at Bloomberg News reports. The new investigation will run parallel to one already launched by the Federal Trade Commission, signaling a growing turf war between the two agencies tasked with overseeing antitrust law in the United States.

Originally the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide antitrust investigations, with the Justice Department taking Apple and Google and the FTC looking into Amazon and Facebook. But Attorney General William P. Barr pushed to retain some oversight of Facebook and may make a similar play for Amazon, David reports.

While sources say the Justice Department will focus on different aspects of Facebook’s business from the FTC, the power grab hasn’t been well received. FTC Chairman Joe Simons wrote a letter to the Justice Department about the issues, sources tell David. Simons acknowledged potential disagreements between the two agencies in a Senate hearing last week. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

BYTES: Amazon is adding Alexa to everything from a ring to glasses, my colleagues Heather Kelly and Jay Greene report. The new devices will test whether customers are ready to trust Amazon with their privacy.

Amazon senior vice president for devices Dave Limp spent the first 10 minutes of his presentation at Amazon's fall product event describing the company's privacy features — signaling how the issue is increasingly top of mind for tech companies.

Amazon will now allow users to delete recordings on a rolling basis in addition to a recently introduced tool that allows users to activate deletion through voice commands. Users will also be able to ask Alexa what the device heard and why it took specific actions, Heather and Jay report.

Amazon has also improved the accuracy of detecting when users say “Alexa” to wake the device to hear commands by 50 percent, reducing the number of recordings captured by Alexa, Limp said.

Users will have to opt in for the new privacy feature, however, which has drawn some criticism.

My colleague Geoffrey Fowler said:

Amazon still doesn’t get it on privacy.



Alexa ‘auto-delete’ is not what we need to protect our privacy.

Amazon's continued push into products for children could also raise alarm among privacy advocates. The company announced it would introduce a messaging app for kids, my colleagues report. Consumer groups accused Amazon of violating federal privacy protections for children by collecting voice recordings on the Echo Dot Kids Edition earlier this year.

The changes follow a number of privacy gaffes for the company, including a Bloomberg News report earlier that year that Amazon gave contractors access to the Alexa recordings — some of which held personal information — without users' knowledge. Amazon also retains transcripts of Alexa requests after audio files are deleted, the company admitted to Congress in July.

RANT AND RAVE

Twitter greeted the announcement of Amazon's new Echo Loop, an Alexa-enabled ring, with a mix of confusion and curiosity.

-- The Federal Trade Commission is suing one of the nation’s biggest online dating sites for playing with the heartstrings — and purse strings — of users. The FTC sued Match.com, whose parent company also owns Tinder and OkCupid, for allegedly duping users into upgrading to paid subscriptions to access messages from matches that the company knew were from scammers.

Between June 2016 to May 2018, Match.com reported that nearly half a million customers subscribed to its paid services after receiving an advertisement touting a match with a fraudulent profile, which make up as much as 30 percent of its users, the FTC claims. The FTC is also alleging the company used deceptive marketing practices by promising users a free six-month subscription and by not disclosing all the requirements for redeeming the subscription.

“Online dating services obviously shouldn’t be using romance scammers as a way to fatten their bottom line,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.

Match Group said on its website that the lawsuit is based on “completely meritless allegations supported by consciously misleading figures.” The company reports that it catches and neutralizes 96 percent of improper accounts within a day. The FTC initially offered to resolve its claims with a consent order mandating certain changes in the company's business practices, as well as a payment in the amount of $60 million, but no resolution was reached.

-- Today a coalition of 39 organizations and individuals sent an open letter to Congress encouraging lawmakers to create “appropriate safeguards” for police use of facial recognition technology instead of banning its use.

“Facial recognition technology performs significantly better than people tasked with the same responsibilities,” Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Vice President Daniel Castro said in a statement. “Bans on facial recognition technology put improvements in community safety in a standstill, blocking advancements that would improve both public security and law enforcement oversight.”

In addition to ITIF, other signatories included the National Police Foundation and the tech lobbying group Computing Technology Industry Association.

We apologize for the delay.

THE BIG IDEA: If President Trump thought releasing the readout of his call with Ukraine’s president would break impeachment fever on Capitol Hill, he miscalculated.

The five-page summary released this morning intensified Democratic demands to see the entire whistleblower complaint. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a member of Democratic leadership, said the president asking for Ukraine’s help to undermine his 2020 challenger is “a textbook abuse of power.” At a news conference, he said “the transcripts become exhibit A.”

According to the rough transcript, Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the conduct of Joe Biden and offered to meet with the new president at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said, according to the transcript, after asking for ""a favor."" (Here are seven additional takeaways, via Aaron Blake.)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged fellow party leaders in a private meeting to keep the impeachment investigation narrowly focused on Trump and his dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart, per Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade.

Several Senate Republicans were stunned and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released the rough transcript, Robert Costa reports. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters after reading the transcript.

-- “Senior Justice Department officials said the director of national intelligence referred the concerns about the call to the Justice Department, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws that ban people from soliciting contributions from foreign sources. The inspector general later also referred the matter to the FBI,” Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report. “Career prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department’s criminal division then reviewed the transcript of the call, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts ‘could not make out and cannot make out’ the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be considered ‘a thing of value’ under the law.”

-- What was released by the White House is a five-page summary of a 30-minute conversation. That means some of what was covered is likely not even in the memo. The document includes a disclaimer on the first page that it is “not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.”

“The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,” it says. “A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.”

-- Richard Nixon released a transcript, too. After the revelation that he recorded Oval Office meetings, the then-president refused to turn over the tapes, claiming executive privilege, and fought subpoenas in court. Eventually, trying to quell a political firestorm, he offered transcripts – which he personally edited – and insisted they exonerated him. “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said in April 1974. Months later, when House investigators listened to some of the audio, it turned out there were significant discrepancies and key phrases missing. Ever since Nixon resigned, the White House has, perhaps understandably, generally avoided recording presidential phone calls. That tradition explains why there’s apparently no recording on the American side of Trump’s July conversation.

-- Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill made clear even before the summary came out that the summary will not be enough to deter them from moving ahead with the impeachment inquiry. They argue that Trump does not need to have explicitly linked U.S. financial assistance to a Biden investigation for the call to represent a clear-cut abuse of power. “There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,” Pelosi said during a live event for the Atlantic. “You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. … I don't think there's a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) says the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown and is entitled to legal protections, wants to speak to members of his committee and has formally sought guidance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire about how he could do so. “We’re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff tweeted. Lawyers for the whistleblower confirmed this.

-- The Senate passed a resolution last night, by unanimous consent and with no Republican objections, calling for the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required by law. The House plans to vote later today on a resolution condemning the administration’s refusal to provide the complaint. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to sit down with the Ukrainian president later today at the U.N. General Assembly. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify in open session tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee and then in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

-- Pelosi personally informed Trump of her decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in a Tuesday morning phone call. “The president, in New York for the U.N. meeting, telephoned the speaker to discuss gun legislation, Pelosi told lawmakers in private meetings,” per Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. “The conversation, however, quickly turned to the president’s conversations with the Ukrainian leader. Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions … Trump told Pelosi that he wasn’t the one blocking the complaint. … She responded that he had the power to fix it and challenged him to turn over the complaint.”

-- The New York Times reports that White House and intelligence officials are trying to hash out a plan to release a redacted version of the whistleblower report in a bid to quell calls for impeachment and sow Democratic divisions on the best path forward: “People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report. “The appearance that they were stonewalling Congress, in their view, could prove more damaging than the whistle-blower’s account. Mr. Trump also believes that the allegations about him are not nearly as damning as they have been portrayed and that disclosing them will undercut the impeachment drive, people close to the president said.”

-- A senior administration official told Politico that the White House is “preparing” to give Congress both the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general’s report by the end of this week. “The administration official stressed the decision and timing could change over the next few days,” Nancy Cook reports. “The format of presentation, or process of viewing the documents, wasn't decided. The president has agreed to the move, the official added.”

-- Even though the whistleblower complaint focused on the Trump call with Zelensky, officials familiar with its contents say that it includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations. “Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official said. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.” That anonymous quote comes from a story that posted last night by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima.

“Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists … to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev,” they report. “The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain. As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with [Zelensky] out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race …

“U.S. officials described an atmosphere of intense pressure inside the NSC and other departments since the existence of the whistleblower complaint became known, with some officials facing suspicion that they had a hand either in the complaint or in relaying damaging information to the whistleblower … One official — speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity — described the climate as verging on ‘bloodletting.’ … Trump has fanned this dynamic with his own denunciations of the whistleblower and thinly veiled suggestions that the person should be outed. … Trump’s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was ordered by Trump to suspend the aid to Ukraine, are also increasingly targets of internal finger-pointing. Mulvaney has agitated for foreign aid to be cut universally but has also stayed away from meetings with Giuliani and Trump …

“Then-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression … But by then his standing with Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Giuliani’s agenda or authority … Giuliani told The Post that one of his calls with a top Ukrainian aide was partially arranged by Kurt Volker, a State Department official, and that he briefed the department afterward. ‘We had the same visibility as anybody else — watching Giuliani on television,’ a former senior official said. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Giuliani was a designated representative.”

-- Giuliani had an outburst on Fox News last night when a fellow panelist was talking over him. “Shut up, moron,” Giuliani shouted on “The Ingraham Angle,” yelling at liberal radio host Christopher Hahn. “Shut up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” (Allyson Chiu)

DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS REMAIN OVER IMPEACHMENT:

-- Pelosi’s declaration left unsettled key questions about how that investigation will unfold. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore some of them: “How sweeping will the probe be? How long will it last? Who will conduct it? And will Pelosi’s unilateral pronouncement — which was delivered with no immediate plans to ratify it with a House vote — do anything to change the course of existing investigations that have hit a stone wall of White House resistance? … The lack of detail about the road ahead, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, reflected both the speed with which once-wavering Democrats unified behind a formal impeachment probe — and the continuing divisions among them on how it should be conducted. …

“[T]he House Judiciary Committee will continue playing the lead role in the proceedings, despite the desire of some Democrats to involve a broader swath of lawmakers and to at least partly sideline Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel’s fervently pro-impeachment chairman. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s announcement, Pelosi explored potentially establishing a special ‘select’ committee, with members handpicked by House leaders, but backed away from that idea after the dispute generated protests from liberals and threatened to divide the caucus along ideological lines. … The past two presidential impeachment processes, involving [Nixon] and Bill Clinton, included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate. There are no plans for such a vote now … That is a question likely to be litigated in the courts. …

“Meanwhile, an even more fundamental dispute lingered — one that may not be resolved any time soon. Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry … and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by [Mueller], episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry. More than 30 Democratic lawmakers announced support for impeachment just this week, many of them Democratic ‘frontliners’ in vulnerable districts who said that the Ukraine allegations prompted them to speak out. … ‘This should be a very distinct procedure relative to this allegation, rather than the whole basket,’ said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a freshman who backed impeachment proceedings Monday after months of resisting pressure to take that step.

“But Pelosi’s involvement of other committees besides the Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence panels with direct jurisdiction over the Ukraine matter suggest the impeachment brief could go much wider. The Financial Services Committee, for instance, is probing Trump’s real estate dealings; the Ways and Means Committee is seeking Trump’s tax returns; and the Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating whether Trump is using the presidency for self-enrichment. ‘I see the most recent issue as one issue among many issues,’ said Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who has pushed for Trump’s impeachment for two years, forcing multiple unsuccessful votes on removing Trump over alleged instances of bigotry.”

-- Our latest whip count: 198 House Democrats now publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry. That includes 22 of the 24 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. Fifty-seven Democrats endorsed proceedings in a period of 24 hours:

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democrats have crossed the Rubicon, and nobody really knows where it will lead. “I can’t tell you what will come from this. I don’t think anybody can,” said Dan Sena, who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. “But it is definitely going to be an X-factor going into the 2020 election.” Michael Scherer talked to several other political professionals:

Democratic strategists hope the fact pattern behind Trump’s communications with Ukraine is far more direct and damning than the complex stories of potential obstruction contained in Bob Mueller's report: “This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened.""

“This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened."" GOP strategists hope impeachment would gin up their voters in 2020: “There is nothing that will do more for Republican turnout than this. And the last couple of presidential elections have all been turnout elections,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster working on the Trump reelection effort.

-- A Quinnipiac poll that was in the field from this past Thursday through Monday found that 57 percent of voters believe Trump should not be impeached. John Wagner reports: “Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”

-- This explains why many moderate Democrats still remain cautious. For example, Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) – who picked up a Republican seat in the Kansas City suburbs last year – expressed support for Pelosi’s pronouncement last night but carefully avoided using the word “impeachment” in her statement. (K.C. Star)

-- Biden is mostly alone in the Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry. Speaking in Delaware, the former vice president called on Congress to begin proceedings if the White House continues stalling lawmakers' investigations. ""Biden, who spoke for several minutes and left without taking questions, said that if Trump doesn’t comply with Congress, it will be forced to begin impeachment hearings,"" Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve Wootson Jr. report:

Bernie Sanders would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment come before the Senate, saying he wants to review evidence before making a decision. He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa.

He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa. Elizabeth Warren said proceedings must begin now.

, who has been more cautious on the question, said Trump “has made it clear he deserves to be impeached.” Beto O’Rourke called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.”

called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.” Hillary Clinton also changed her mind, saying she’s now in favor of moving toward impeachment of a president she described as a “corrupt human tornado.” “I did not come to that decision easily or quickly,” she said, “but this is an emergency as I see it.”

-- The impeachment debate will effectively freeze the 2020 campaign, predicts ABC News political director Rick Klein: “It would all play out against an inconvenient political timeline, with hearings in the House and a potential trial in the Senate almost certainly extending well into the winter. That's the precise time that campaigning is most intense, with primary voting beginning in February. For the six senators and two sitting House members running for president, that could make for far more time spent at the day job in Washington than anticipated. Long-developed plans for policy rollouts and potential breakout moments could wind up subsumed by the news.""

-- The Trump reelection campaign immediately tried to turn the impeachment inquiry into a fundraising opportunity. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “Emails, texts, tweets and a video directed his supporters to a new Republican portal designed to capi­tal­ize on Trump’s army of online donors. ‘The Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU, Friend. They want to take YOUR VOTE away,’ read an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon. ‘President Trump wants to know who stood with him when it mattered most.’ … The appeals on Tuesday called on his supporters to join an ‘Official Impeachment Defense Task Force’ made up of ‘only President Trump’s most LOYAL supporters,’ with suggested donations ranging from $5 to the maximum $2,800, or $45 to show support for the 45th president.”

-- In public, Trumpworld is making the impeachment inquiry look like white noise. But in private, White House aides and allies are starting to feel anxious. Politico reports: “Few in the White House or the wider Trump orbit have privately defended Trump’s call … ‘The president’s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,’ said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. … The White House is betting Trump can ride out this ‘outrage du jour,’ as one senior administration official called it, and move on just as he has skated through the … dozens of other threats to his presidency. … But current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego — and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.”

-- The world is reacting warily to the specter of impeachment. Rick Noack and David Crawshaw report: Some experts said it “would have little effect on hot-button issues such as the trade dispute with China or his promises on Brexit, while others predicted that increased domestic pressure would force Trump to seek a quick foreign-policy breakthrough… The developments weighed on financial markets, already hit by concerns about global economic weakness and the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.”

COMMENTARY:

-- “I’m a Republican. Let’s force the question of impeachment with the GOP,” writes veteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy: “In the wake of the president’s actions on Ukraine, the Republican Party and the officials who lead it must be brutally marked to market on the issue of Trump’s fitness for office. This test would create an existential question for every Republican senator and representative: Why am I here? To serve my future or my country?”

-- “This isn’t just another spat. Trump compromised our security for his gain,” writes columnist David Ignatius: “Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country. … Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are.”

-- “If we legitimize Trump’s behavior, it will be open season on our politics,” writes columnist Robert Kagan: “Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents … Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.”

-- “Republicans (who decided perjury about sex was impeachment-worthy, and who thought it an abuse of power to defer deportations of certain illegal immigrants) must now decide whether to accept Trump’s standard as proper for future presidents,” writes columnist Dana Milbank.

-- Conservative columnist Max Boot identifies seven reasons why he thinks Trump should be impeached:

He obstructed the administration of justice.

He failed to defend America from foreign election interference.

He attempted to investigate and prosecute his political opponents.

He failed to produce papers and testimony as duly directed by Congress.

He conspired with Michael Cohen to conceal alleged extramarital relationships.

He misused his emergency powers to spend funds on a border wall.

He retains ownership of a global business empire, which allows him to benefit from dealings with foreign and state governments.

-- But Biden sill could wind up being the principal casualty, Pat Buchanan writes, hopefully, in the New Hampshire Union Leader: “Calls are rising for Biden’s son to be called to testify before congressional committees. ... The charges and the countercharges will become what the campaign is all about.""

-- Democrats are upholding a double standard on Ukraine, chimes in conservative columnist Marc Thiessen.

-- Impeaching Trump could hurt the institution of the presidency, worries John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration: “If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.”

-- We should talk about how Ukrainians feel about this, says Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, in the Times: “Ukraine remains in a precarious position. Crimea is still under Russian control, and the war in the east continues; the fight against corruption at home is also not yet won. In all of these matters, Ukraine is reliant on bipartisan American support, which is why our leadership is desperate to avoid becoming part of the American presidential campaign. Ukraine is now facing the prospect of becoming a double victim: on the one hand, a victim of [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression; on the other, a victim of Mr. Trump’s desire to be re-elected at any price.”

-- The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board calls this the Impeachment Congress: “Mr. Trump’s invitation to Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden, if that’s what it was, showed bad judgment in our view … But bad judgment is not a crime, and voters may demand more to annul an election only months before they have a chance to render their own judgment about Mr. Trump’s behavior.""

-- Pelosi’s patience on impeachment has paid off, so far, CNN’s Michael Warren writes: “Democrats have now created the appearance that impeachment of Trump is a last resort, not a first resort. She divorced the process from the mess of the Mueller findings. And she allowed those moderate freshmen who built her majority, rather than the divisive members on the left, to lead on the issue.”

-- “Pelosi has to hope for the worst case for Trump,"" writes National Review executive editor Rich Lowry, ""because it’s going to be difficult to climb down from impeachment now.""

-- Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume believes Pelosi has handled this cleverly: “It strikes me that the Speaker and the other leaders are under pressure from the left wing of the party and the leftists in their caucus -- who are numerous -- to move ahead here … I think [she’s] thinking that she needs to be responsive to the needs of her caucus -- look at what she did today, it was really quite clever if you think about it.”

Bijan Rafiekian leaves a court hearing last year in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

THERE’S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- A judge overturned a jury's verdict convicting Michael Flynn’s former business partner of illegally lobbying for Turkey, saying the evidence against him was “insufficient.” Rachel Weiner reports: “'The verdict was against the heavy weight of the evidence,’ Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote in a 39-page opinion tossing Bijan Rafiekian’s convictions. The decision is another blow to efforts by the Justice Department to crack down on unregistered lobbying for foreign governments. … Trenga pointed to the fact that Flynn was not charged or implicated by prosecutors until the eve of trial as ‘particularly telling.’”

-- Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic power broker, and Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman, said they were notified on Monday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had closed the inquiry into work they did that benefited Ukrainian interests. It’s another reflection of the challenges facing prosecutors attempting to more aggressively pursue possible violations of foreign lobbying rules, Tom Hamburger and Matt Zapotosky report: “The decision to drop the investigation came weeks after a federal jury in Washington found former White House counsel Gregory B. Craig not guilty of lying to the Justice Department about his media contacts related to his work for the Ukrainian government. …

""Weber and Podesta were among several lobbyists and lawyers that (Paul) Manafort helped bring aboard as part of an effort to improve the image of the Ukrainian government between 2012 and 2014, according to Mueller’s report. Mueller ultimately referred the case involving the two men to federal prosecutors in New York. ... As the investigation proceeded, Podesta closed his iconic lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, in the fall of 2017. Weber left Mercury, a firm he had helped lead since 2011, in August.”

-- A federal judge rejected former Trump confidant Roger Stone’s request to suppress all evidence gathered through 18 search warrants at his November trial. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Attorneys for Stone had argued that prosecutors illegally relied on unproven assumptions about Russia’s involvement and sought to force them to prove in court the role of Russian operatives in hacks on the Democratic National Committee and [Clinton’s] presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone had ‘not come close’ to showing the government misled the magistrates or judges who approved the warrants, that federal agents knowingly or intentionally lied to them or that the warrants were premised on Russia’s role in the hacking.”

Students line up for school lunches at an elementary school in Canton, Miss. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- A new Trump administration proposal to limit the number of people who qualify for food stamps could end free school lunches for about 500,000 American children. Moriah Balingit reports: “The change, proposed over the summer, would cut an estimated 3 million people from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. It is intended to eliminate eligibility for people who get food stamps because they have qualified for other forms of government aid, even though they may have savings or other assets. But the impact of the cuts is anticipated to go further: Children in those households could also lose access to free school lunches, since food stamp eligibility is one way students can qualify for the lunches.”

-- NASA is trying to land on the moon, and its biggest obstacle might be Congress. Christian Davenport reports: NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is seeking “votes in Congress for what could become one of the boldest human exploration endeavors NASA has undertaken in decades — the first return to the moon since the end of the Apollo era. … Bridenstine knows that before NASA builds the rockets, spacecraft and lunar landers needed for the mission, the agency must clear the political roadblocks that are every bit as daunting as the vacuum of space. While members of Congress love to say they support NASA — as they do lowering crime or boosting national security — getting them to increase the agency’s budget is another story. Traditionally, space does not equal votes in elections. And getting Democrats to support a project that, if successful, could be a legacy for the Trump administration is going to be a tough sell.”

-- The administration has granted few waivers to visitors blocked from entering the U.S. by the travel ban Trump imposed days after taking office, with officers arguing that people from five predominantly Muslim countries continue to pose a national security threat. Abigail Haulsohner reports: “Since the initial rollout, in early 2017, of what critics and federal judges have branded a ‘Muslim ban,’ the Trump administration has fielded approximately 72,000 visa applications from the citizens of Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, a U.S. State Department official told members of Congress on Tuesday. Approximately 10 percent of those applicants — 7,679 — have received waivers to enter the United States, according to Edward Ramotowski, deputy assistant secretary for visa services at the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, who testified during a House judiciary and foreign affairs subcommittee hearing.”

-- The chief executive of Juul Labs is stepping down amid outrage over the soaring use of teenage vaping. From the Times: “The executive, Kevin Burns, will be replaced by K.C. Croswaite, an executive from Altria, the major tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in Juul, the San-Francisco-based company. Juul also said it would end one of its campaigns, ‘Make the Switch,’ which the Food and Drug Administration had criticized as an effort to portray its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. The company also said it would not fight the Trump administration’s proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.”

-- Massachusetts will place a four-month ban on all sales of vaping products, the toughest state crackdown on e-cigarettes so far. Hannah Knowles reports: “Bans on sales of flavored vaping products took effect this month in New York and Michigan, and the Trump administration said it plans to enact a similar regulation at the federal level. Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine. But Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that’s expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

-- California health officials called on everyone to stop vaping immediately, per the Los Angeles Times: “‘We are seeing something that we have not seen before,’ said Dr. Charity Dean, California’s acting public health officer, in a statement. ‘There are numerous unknown factors at this time, and due to the uncertainty of the exact cause, it is our recommendation that consumers refrain from vaping until the investigation has concluded.’”

-- House Republicans are seriously considering relaxing term limits for committee chairmen. From Politico: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of changing the GOP’s long-standing rule that allows members to be the top Republican on a committee for only three terms, regardless of whether they serve in the majority or minority. One idea that was suggested, according to multiple Republican sources who attended the meeting, is allowing a lawmaker’s term as ranking member to not count the same as a chairmanship.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- A new United Nations climate report finds that massive change is already here for the world’s oceans and frozen regions. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Wednesday’s report on the world’s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects only foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked. Given current emissions levels, a number of serious impacts are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Extreme floods that have historically struck some coastal cities and small island nations once every 100 years will become an annual occurrence by 2050, according to the IPCC. In addition, if emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century — around 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries. … More than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report...""

-- A glacier on Mont Blanc could collapse. From the BBC: “About 250,000 cubic metres of ice are in danger of breaking away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak ... The mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur said global warming was changing the mountain. … The glacier, in the Glarus Alps, has shrunk to a tiny fraction of its original size. Scientists say it has lost at least 80% of its volume just since 2006, a trend accelerated by rising global temperatures.”

-- The Trump administration declared there’s no “international right to abortion” during the U.N. General Assembly, calling on other countries to join a coalition pushing the elimination of what it calls “ambiguous” terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health, from U.N. documents. Ariana Eunjung Cha reports: “Earlier this year, HHS officials began meeting with representatives from other countries, urging them to join a new international coalition that would focus on the value of the family, and which would not condone harmful sexual risks for young people, or promote abortion as a means of family planning.

“Other countries, civil society and women’s rights groups have expressed alarm at the efforts and accused the United States of aligning with countries like Saudi Arabia and Sudan with poor human rights records and, also, of putting unfair pressure on poor countries that depend on U.S. aid.""

-- Trump condemned globalism during his address to the General Assembly. Anne Gearan and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump read his address in a somber monotone, rarely punctuating words or pausing for emphasis, but his message for the 74th session of the annual gathering of world leaders was clear as he argued that a view of the world as a global commons had ‘exerted a religious pull over past leaders’ at the expense of their own nations. … In his 37-minute address, Trump stressed that all nations must take care of themselves first while adding that the United States would get involved abroad only when its own interests were threatened. He also used his platform Tuesday to take a hard line against Iran...""

-- Trump also heaped praise on Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi during UNGA. At home, Sissi faces mass protests to step down from human rights activists. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “When asked Monday whether he was concerned about the anti-Sissi demonstrations, Trump shrugged the suggestion aside. ‘Demonstrations? No, everybody has demonstrations,’ he told reporters ... ‘Egypt has a great leader. He’s highly respected; he’s brought order. Before he was here, there was very little order. There was chaos. So I’m not worried about that.’ … Trump and Sissi’s meeting Monday came just days after viral videos from a former government contractor alleging Sissi was complicit in a large-scale corruption scandal provoked protests in Egypt. People took to the streets in Cairo and elsewhere Friday, chanting, ‘Rise up, fear not, Sissi must go.’ The protests were relatively small but significant because such concerted public displays against Sissi are rare.”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the Amazon isn’t on fire, rejecting calls for foreign intervention. Marina Lopes reports: “The Amazon isn’t in flames, he told [UNGA] in New York, but brimming with riches. And Brazil will decide how to develop it. ‘We are open to explore our potential in a sustainable way, through partnerships that add value,’ Bolsonaro said. It was his first address on the world stage since the worst fires in a decade hit the Amazon this year. In a speech peppered with references to God, socialism and patriotism, he said foreign powers with an eye on Brazil’s natural riches ‘have an interest in keeping indigenous people living like cave men.’”

-- Venezuela’s ex-intelligence chief said he told President Nicolás Maduro about Colombian guerrilla camps in Venezuela. Anthony Faiola reports: Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figueroa said he hand-delivered reports including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil. “‘They never took action,’ he said. ‘You could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.’ Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia’s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. … The classified report ... offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro’s personal knowledge of the guerrillas’ presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating. “

-- Hong Kong police are waging a war on facts as protests on the island continue. David Crawshaw and Timothy McLaughlin report: “The ‘yellow object’ lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the video footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of it was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts. As Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, it appeared to squirm. … With Beijing asserting increasing control over the city’s institutions and Hong Kong’s leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, authorities here appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law. Instead, their approach this week was to obfuscate. Asked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an ‘officer kicking a yellow object,’ not a man lying on the ground.”

Those efforts prompted that whistleblower complaint that was released this morning and have led to an official impeachment inquiry.

The White House counsel helped to identify legal obstacles to the disclosure of information that could be politically damaging to Trump. The head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a classified opinion to initially block the whistleblower’s complaint from being transmitted to congressional committees that are legally entitled to receive it. The director of DOJ’s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community’s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden. And Bill Barr declined to recuse himself, even though Trump invoked the attorney general at least twice during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Here’s a quick primer on why each of the four taxpayer-funded attorneys is in the spotlight:

Steven Engel, director of the Office of Legal Counsel:

In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump’s call. The IG said this was credible and urgent and should be turned over to Congress. But then Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI, contacted the Justice Department to ask for guidance. Engel issued a secret memo on Sept. 3 saying that the complaint didn’t need to be turned over to congressional intelligence committee because it was outside of the DNI’s jurisdiction. Instead, he said the allegation would more properly be referred to the Justice Department as a potential criminal matter for further review. (The DOJ published yesterday an unclassified version of Engel’s legal reasoning.)

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal division:

When the intelligence community IG submitted a criminal referral that said the president possibly violated campaign finance laws, it was Benczkowski who made the call within a matter of weeks that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation of Trump. He’s a former Senate GOP staffer who worked at the same law firm as Barr before being appointed to the job. Benczkowski’s confirmation was held up for a stretch two years ago because of his legal work for a Russian bank.

“Senior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to ‘quantify’ the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the ‘best evidence’ to help determine what to do,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. “The FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. … They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.”

“All relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

Attorney General Bill Barr:

Justice Department officials also said that the attorney general was “generally knowledgeable” of discussions about Engel’s decision but he didn’t make the call not to move forward with the investigation.

Kupec, Barr’s spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

She added that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” per Devlin, Matt, Carol Leonnig and Shane Harris.

But Democrats said Barr should have recused himself entirely. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Barr to not be involved with anything related to Ukraine and this episode. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate and formerly California’s attorney general, demanded that Barr testify under oath before Congress as soon as possible about his role.

“Trump has repeatedly lauded Barr, a stark contrast from his relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions,” the AP’s Michael Balsamo and Mark Sherman note. “Not only did Barr provide the first, favorable framing for the Mueller report, but he also … has supported the White House’s decision to claim broad executive privilege to prevent the testimony of administration officials that could be potentially damaging for Trump. Barr has also defied subpoenas from Congress — in line with the Trump administration’s stance to block Democrats’ efforts to investigate Trump.”

White House counsel Pat Cipollone:

Cipollone has been engaged in this matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, we reported last week, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump.

Three of my colleagues revealed yesterday that Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he was going to testify about the whistleblower complaint. “He has at times expressed his displeasure to [Cipollone] and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community,” according to Greg Miller, Shane and Karoun Demirjian. “The current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint … It was unclear whether Maguire’s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.”

Maguire denied that he ever threatened to resign, and the White House also disputed the account. After their statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, “We stand by the story.”

TRUMP’S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS ALSO IN THE SPOTLIGHT:

-- In the rough transcript, Trump praises Rudy Giuliani as a “highly respected man” who was a “great mayor” of New York. “If you could speak to him that would be great,” the president tells Zelensky.

-- “Giuliani has claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials have been at the request of the State Department, which remained fully abreast of his dealings. But the details of the July 25 phone call … raise new questions about Giuliani’s role, reinforcing the view of some U.S. officials that he operates at the president’s behest, often in a closed loop, and occasionally in contravention to the messages of diplomats in Kiev,” John Hudson reports. “Technically, it is illegal for private citizens to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the United States under the Logan Act, but the law has rarely been enforced. Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani’s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government …

“Giuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. A State Department official said Giuliani ‘does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government’ and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak’s request. Yermak’s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call. U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said. Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.

“In May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky — who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution — had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early. Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a ‘prosecutor to a former prosecutor.’ But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the ‘black ledger’ that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened. Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: ‘I’m not going to tell you about that.’”

-- Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: “These records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.

“Through these deliberations carried on by his attorneys, Manafort exhorted the White House to press Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit individuals, both in the US and in Ukraine, who he believed had published damning information about his political consulting work in the Ukraine. … [The records show that] on at least three occasions, [Giuliani] was in communication with Manafort’s legal team to discuss how the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had ‘colluded’ to defeat [Trump’s] 2016 presidential bid.”

-- The phone call memo followed Trump’s long obsession with Ukraine. More details from the New York Times: “Long before the July 25 call ... Trump’s focus on Ukraine started after a law enforcement organization, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine, released damaging information about cash payments earmarked to [Manafort] by the Russia-aligned political party of Ukraine’s ousted former president. Even after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign under pressure, he insisted to Mr. Trump’s aides that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was behind the surfacing of the documents revealing the payments, and questioned the authenticity of the documents. … The issue continued to fester with Mr. Trump. He tweeted six months after his inauguration about ‘Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign’ and to ‘boost Clinton,’ and asked, ‘where is the investigation?’”

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT:

-- Read it for yourself here.

-- “The whistleblower complaint focuses largely on the July 25 call … But the complaint also broadly alleges an effort by Trump and [Giuliani] to pressure Ukrainian officials over time … The whistleblower paints a picture, also using public news reports, to suggest that Giuliani pressured Ukrainian officials to further Trump’s interest in investigating his political opponents,” Devlin, Matt, Carol and Shane report.

“The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored … The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call...""

-- “The whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint … [and] the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,” the Times reports. “Mr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public … Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had ‘abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,’ the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.”

­-- The whistleblower tentatively agreed to testify on the condition that Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the person’s lawyers, so they can accompany their client, CNN reports.

THE ATMOSPHERICS ON CAPITOL HILL:

-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting after the release of the rough transcript they should narrow their impeachment investigation to Trump's dealings on Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Democrats said the evidence was incriminating enough — and easy enough for voters to understand — to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. ‘Strike while the iron’s hot,’ said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year. … [Pelosi] told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months — though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment ...

“Multiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.”

-- A milestone: A majority of House members are now on the record in support of opening an impeachment inquiry. As of last night, 217 House Democrats and one independent (Justin Amash) say they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 25 have gone a step further, saying they would definitely support impeaching the president. (The Fix is keeping a live whip count here.)

-- That op-ed published by seven House Democratic freshmen from swing districts with national security credentials proved seismic in pushing both wavering Democrats and Pelosi toward supporting an impeachment inquiry. Paul Kane explains: “Throughout the first phase of the Trump investigations, focusing on Russian interference in 2016, these Democrats found that their constituents were confused by the complicated and long-running investigation by [Mueller]. Instead, while other freshmen got media attention for bashing Trump, this group focused on kitchen-table issues like health-care costs and infrastructure projects. ... Liberal activists tried to jam their town halls, but most Democratic aides reported that aside from one or two impeachment questions, the overwhelming majority of concerns focused on local economic matters. … To be sure, a dozen or so swing-seat Democrats remain mum, declining so far to take a position ... But no one spoke out against impeachment in their Tuesday afternoon huddle in the Capitol basement.""

-- Some House Democrats say they wish Pelosi had waited a little longer. “I don’t get surprised often,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.). “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.” (Mike DeBonis has more.)

THE GOP RESPONSE:

-- ""The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct,"" Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: ""Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election. ...

""On Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood — 'chagrined' but not angry, though skittish about some of the details. At one point, the group began joking with the president that 'this was one of his better' phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.""

-- While most Republican senators publicly toed the line and repeated talking points sent by the White House, several were privately stunned and questioned Trump's judgment after seeing the rough transcript. Robert Costa reports: “One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a ‘huge mistake’ that the GOP now has to confront and defend — while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions ... that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. Publicly, two senators expressed serious concerns about the revelation, as cracks have begun to emerge with GOP lawmakers privately discussing Trump’s conduct and their party’s political standing.""

“Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters.

(R-Neb.) told reporters. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

(R-Utah) told reporters. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said there was “no quid pro quo,” adding, “while the conversation reported in the memorandum … was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”

“One early divide among Senate Republicans is between the ‘Burr camp’ and the ‘Johnson camp,’ according to two senior GOP aides,"" Costa reports, ""referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr’s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump’s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee’s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails while serving as secretary of state.""

-- He does not get a vote, but Vermont’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, said the impeachment inquiry is “appropriate,” per the AP.

-- The impeachment inquiry is threatening to derail most of Trump's domestic agenda, upending trade and spending talks. From Erica Werner and David Lynch: “The White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.""

THE UKRAINE ANGLE:

-- Trump’s meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly offered a platform for salesmanship, grievance and a joke or two. Anne Gearan reports: “‘We spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember,’ Trump cracked. … Zelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that ‘it’s better to be on TV than by phone.’ … Standing alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that ‘nobody pushed me’ to investigate. ‘I think you read everything,’ Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras. ‘I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved’ in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. ‘No, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.’ Trump chimed in: ‘In other words, no pressure.’""

-- Trump called former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin a “very good” prosecutor.” But Shokin resigned in disgrace. David L. Stern reports: Shokin “became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership. At the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors … Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine’s shadows. By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.”

-- Trump boasted about U.S. aid to Ukraine. But America isn’t Kiev’s only friend, writes Ruby Mellen: “Although the United States is one of the country’s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine. The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.”

-- “The U.S. tried to fix Ukraine’s government. We exported our corruption, instead,” laments Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

DOMESTIC POLITICAL FALLOUT:

-- During the Ukraine call, Trump revived a pervasive conspiracy theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima report: “For years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world’s most notorious hacks. … Ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into [DNC] computers in 2016, … CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and [into the president’s call].”

The nature of Trump’s reference to CrowdStrike in his call is not obvious in the White House’s memo, but, basically, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists who have falsely claimed it helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a party insider. In reality, Drew and Ellen explain, “the FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike.""

-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer. Michael Kranish reports: “Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, ‘Secret Empires,’ that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013. … Trump on Wednesday put it this way: ‘When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that’s a horrible thing.’ … In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.

""Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion. Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount. However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.”

-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: “He attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms. … Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states. Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of ‘socialism.’”

-- “An impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats’ choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place,"" writes Karen Tumulty. ""Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder — and maybe impossible — to make their voices heard in the din. ‘Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,’ says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama’s chief strategist.”

-- Trump’s call with Zelensky is unlike anything scholars have heard before, reports Karen DeYoung: “‘This is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,’ said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate. ‘Nixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,’ Hughes said. But ‘when he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,’ Nixon did it at home, he said. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, ‘tended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,’ said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. ‘He was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.’”

-- Before the transcript was released, former New Jersey governor and the onetime Trump transition chief Chris Christie ominously said that Trump would be in trouble if he said something like “do me a favor.” Hours later, it was revealed the president asked the Ukrainian president to “do us a favor.” (Mediaite)

-- The Wall Street Journal stands behind its reporting that Trump pressured Zelensky to work with Giuliani about eight times, despite claims from Trump allies and conservative media that it's wrong. The Journal notes the rough transcript is incomplete. There are also ellipses. (Erik Wemple)

NOTEWORTHY COMMENTARY:

-- Tuesday was Pelosi’s day, but Wednesday was Trump’s – for better or for worse, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “The impeachment inquiry is both an epic battle between the speaker and the president and, more fundamentally, a constitutional clash that will help define the limits on presidential power, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The outcome will shape, perhaps decisively, the 2020 campaign. Trump will either be out of office by January 2021 or he will have emerged victorious, reelected to a second term in large part because of what would then, inevitably, be interpreted as an enormous gamble by the speaker and the Democrats that went terribly wrong. The past two days have shown that there is no turning back.”

-- The Trump-Ukraine transcript contains evidence of a quid pro quo, writes National Review’s David French, a leading conservative attorney: “The transcript provides proof that Trump made a completely improper request that the president of Ukraine work with Trump’s personal counsel to investigate a political rival. It provides strong evidence that this took place in the context of a quid pro quo for desperately needed military aid.”

-- The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president, says The Post’s Editorial Board.

-- The rough transcript of the call is devastating. How could Trump not realize that? Max Boot wonders: “At least Richard Nixon had the good sense to resist releasing the ‘smoking gun’ tape until finally forced to do so by the Supreme Court. … Trump, by contrast, is so clueless — so lacking in even the most basic sense of right and wrong — that he could actually tweet this morning: ‘Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?’”

-- Democrats had no idea Trump would hand them so much ammo, writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

-- The House doesn’t need an impeachment inquiry to confirm Trump’s wrongdoing. His corruption is hidden in plain sight – just look at his D.C. hotel, argues Dana Milbank: “As the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any ‘foreign state’). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.”

THE TRUMP AGENDA:

-- The administration announced an asylum deal with Honduras, which could force migrants into one of the world’s most violent nations. Nick Miroff reports: “Department of Homeland Security officials reached the accord with the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is embroiled in allegations of government corruption and charges that he and others have been operating the nation as a criminal enterprise — Hernández has been named as a co-conspirator in a major U.S. drug trafficking case. The deal paves the way for the United States to take asylum seekers from the U.S. border and ship them to a nation with one of the highest murder rates in the world, a country with gang wars that have fueled waves of mass migration and multiple ‘caravans’ to the United States that became a major irritant to [Trump].”

-- The new deal comes just days after a man was brutally murdered in Honduras -- just hours after being deported from the United States. (La Prensa)

-- The Republican-controlled Senate voted for the second time to overturn Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but the body once again fell well short of the veto-proof, two-thirds majority needed to block the president from diverting military construction money to his pet project. (Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg)

-- Human rights groups demanded that ICE release all LGBTQ detainees and anyone with HIV in the agency’s custody. Robert Moore reports: “‘We know that lack of medical and mental-health care, including lack of HIV care, is the norm,’ Roger Coggan, director of legal services at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told reporters Wednesday afternoon. ‘By the Department of Homeland Security’s own count, 300 individuals identifying as transgender have been in custody and at the mercy of ICE since October of 2018. These cruel incarcerations need to stop immediately.’ DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint. It is unclear how many LGBTQ people and people with HIV are detained by U.S. immigration officials.”

-- Trump's decision to move the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service out of Washington will cause “significant delays” in vital research reports on which farmers depend. Politico reports: “ERS conducts research into areas such as climate change, nutrition, export data and the farm economy. Farmers also heavily rely on its outlook reports to make planting decisions. Crop markets can swing on the results of the numbers. ... USDA identified 38 specific reports that may be delayed because staff members have departed.""

­-- Income inequality has grown, including in heartland states. From the AP: “The nation’s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau’s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of ‘0’ indicates perfect equality, while a score of ‘1’ indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.”

-- The Federal Aviation Administration disputed an independent watchdog’s finding that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing’s 737 Max jets were underqualified. Ian Duncan reports: “Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog’s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was ‘not what happened,’ ... that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was ‘simply not accurate.’”

-- Trump’s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional materials distributed at private meetings with American military air crews. From The Scotsman: “The document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at ‘closed’ meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasizes the ‘five star’ status of the US president’s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been ‘newly refurbished.’ Two sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses the United Nations General Assembly. (Craig Ruttle/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The White House banned Iranian officials from entering the U.S. just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly, per the Times: “Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.""

-- Shortly after, Rouhani warned the Persian Gulf is ""on the edge of collapse."" From the AP: ""Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in 'international piracy' against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran 'will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,' Rouhani said ... 'Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.' ... Rouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington 'unable to resolve the more sophisticated issues' plaguing the Middle East.""

-- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaking about his role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder for the first time, said it was done without his knowledge. From Frontline: “‘It happened under my watch,’ the Saudi leader [said.] ‘I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.’ But he insists that it was without his knowledge. … [bin Salman was pressed] on how the murder could have happened without him knowing about it. ‘We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,’ Prince Mohammed responded. … ‘I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they’re responsible, they have the authority to do that,’ Prince Mohammed said.”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try forming a new governing coalition. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority. But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.”

-- Returning to Westminster, Prime Minister Boris Johnson goaded opposition lawmakers to call a no-confidence vote or agree to a general election and bring the Brexit fight back to the people after the Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was ‘wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.’ Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.”

-- At least 70 countries have engaged in disinformation campaigns, according to a new report by researchers at Oxford University. From the NYT: “In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia’s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor. Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing … The researchers … found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.”

-- Military drones are now common in nearly 100 nations, a new report found. From the WSJ: “China is a top exporter of drones alongside Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Pentagon officials have expressed concern over Beijing’s dominance of the global market for small drones. There are at least 21,000 and probably more than 30,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in military service world-wide, the report says. It catalogs 171 types of drones in military inventories and 268 military-drone units established by 58 countries. Fifteen countries have training academies for drone operators, and seven maintain drone bases outside their own borders, according to the report.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Cindy McCain, widow of John McCain, criticized the GOP, saying it is no longer the party she and her husband belonged to. Kim Bellware reports: McCain, when asked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election, “pointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that ‘it’s not functioning well’ and excludes people who aren’t ‘walking the line.’ ‘That’s just not right,’ McCain said. ‘That’s not the party my husband and I belonged to.’ While those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party’s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state’s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized — and vocal — Latino population and transplants from around the country. … ‘I can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,’ McCain said. ‘I’m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.’”

-- Elizabeth Warren is rising everywhere, per CNN: “The latest Quinnipiac University national poll ... has Warren at 27% to [Biden’s] 25%. Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. ... The trendline is what is important here.""

-- A volunteer for Warren’s campaign was killed in a car crash in western Iowa. Zachary Crombie Presberg, 22, joined the campaign as a summer organizing fellow and had stayed on as a volunteer. (Des Moines Register)

-- More infighting: Top aides are privately questioning Bernie Sanders's strategy. From CNN: “The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air. … Even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away. The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.”

-- Biden’s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president’s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden “made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate. James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico]. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. 'He said his brother would be very excited about this product,' Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.”

-- Cory Booker has crossed the halfway threshold to his $1.7 million fundraising goal. His campaign manager said that he needs to raise that much in the final 10 days of September to have a viable path forward, per Yahoo News.

-- Tulsi Gabbard qualified for the fourth Democratic debate after missing out on the third one. The Hawaii Democrat has the support of 2 percent of registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters, according to a Monmouth University poll, per the Columbus Dispatch.

A Democratic congressman from Arizona, an Iraq War veteran, explained why it was so significant Trump asked for a favor right after Ukraine's president said they wanted to buy more Javelins:

The Javelin was specifically designed to take out Russian tanks. It is laser guided, can deployed by one person, training is quick and has a 2 kilometer range.

The Gini index measures wealth distribution across a population, with zero representing total equality and 1 representing total inequality, where all wealth is concentrated in a single household. The indicator has been rising steadily for several decades. When the Census Bureau began studying income inequality in 1967, the Gini index was 0.397. In 2018, it climbed to 0.485.

By comparison, no European nation had a score greater than 0.38 last year.

The federal minimum wage has stood at $7.25 for more than a decade. That’s one of the biggest reasons the gap between the rich and poor is widening, said Brielle Bryan, an assistant professor of sociology at Rice University.

AD

“Inequality will go up as long as the people at the top of the tail are seeing their wealth increase,” Bryan said. “A booming economy means that people who have higher income and own capital are able to see continued higher returns on that.”

Recent economic gains by lower-income workers who have found jobs and benefited from minimum-wage increases in many states haven’t made up for the long-running trend of the wealthy seeing far larger income growth than middle- or lower-income earners. The number of families earning $15,000 or less has fallen since 2007, according to the latest census data, while the number of households bringing in $250,000 a year or more has grown more than 15 percent.

Though the gap between the richest and poorest expanded, the nation’s median household income topped $63,000 for the first time. However, after adjusting for inflation, it’s roughly the same as it was 20 years ago.

AD

The persistent rise in inequality has become a central topic in the 2020 presidential race, with candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren calling for a wealth tax. This week, Sanders unveiled a proposal that would impose a tax as high as 8 percent on the ultrawealthy, raising $4.35 trillion over a decade, according to an analysis by economists who consulted with the Warren and Sanders campaigns.

“There should be no billionaires,” Sanders tweeted when he announced his plan. “We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people.”

Systemic inequality is actually starkest in the top tier of the economic ladder, which is populated primarily by white men, Bryan said. Women in the 95th percentile of earners make around 68 cents on the dollar compared with their male counterparts.

“We don’t have as much sympathy for CEOs,” Bryan said, “but what’s happening at the top end is really symbolic of problems happening throughout the system.”

This is a column about Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and why you should or should not prefer the former over the latter. But before digging into that question, I’d like call your attention to something that is too often ignored in the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate: The American left’s bark is louder than its bite.

In recent years, socialists and their left-liberal fellow travelers have accrued an unprecedented degree of influence over our nation’s political discourse. As the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis undermined mainstream economic orthodoxy — and radicalized a generation of overeducated, underemployed journalists and academics — the technocracy’s center of gravity shifted leftward. In 2019, the Democrats’ Establishment think tank is agitating for industry-wide collective bargaining, the mainstream media has adopted a reflexively sympathetic attitude toward striking public-sector workers, and conscious capitalists are giving TED Talks on the evils of neoliberalism.

Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders’s surprising strength in the 2016 primaries and Hillary Clinton’s devastating weakness in that year’s general election — and the online left’s success in popularizing its interpretations of both phenomena— persuaded many 2020 Democratic hopefuls to stop worrying and learn to love social democracy. At the first three Democratic debates, the middle-ground position on health care was a public option strong enough to jeopardize the viability of private insurance. On higher education, it was free public college for all children from working-class families. On climate, it was “only” $1.7 trillion in green investments, and a mandate for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But the left’s ideological clout far outstrips its material strength. American socialism is heavy on superstructure, light on base. The current trade-union movement is weak by historic standards, representing a piddling 10.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. Independent leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have grown since 2016 but still lack the scale and mass working-class membership that made such entities formidable agents of social change in earlier eras of American history. In the electoral realm, progressive challengers scored a couple notable victories in the 2018 primaries but failed to foment a “tea party of the left.” Outside of low-turnout elections in deep-blue districts, organizations like Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, and DSA gave Democratic incumbents little cause for fearing their wrath. And where left insurgents did win open primaries in purple territory, they failed to affirm their theory of change: Nominating economic populists unencumbered by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s allergy to class-warfare rhetoric and radical reforms like Medicare for All did not fix what’s the matter with Kansas. Sanders-backed ironworker Randy Bryce did worse in Wisconsin’s 1st District last year than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Single-payer supporter Kara Eastman failed to flip Nebraska’s 2nd. The 2018 elections did not prove the electoral necessity of moderation — Warren acolyte Katie Porter pulled out a tough win in a historically Republican California district; Senator Tammy Baldwin’s calls for abolishing private insurance and putting workers on corporate boards proved compatible with winning reelection in a Trump state — but nor did they prove that Sanders-ism an electoral panacea.

Thus far, the 2020 primary has further undermined the notion that Democratic voters will overwhelmingly support radical change if only the left can get the Establishment’s thumbs off the scale. Joe Biden owes his front-runner status less to his party’s high-dollar donors than its high-propensity voters. Few Democratic pooh-bahs went into 2019 favoring Uncle Joe. Many saw Kamala Harris as Hillary’s heiress apparent, while others were so averse to backing Obama’s senescent wingman that they put their chips on the mayor of South Bend instead. But the people (or a plurality of them, anyway) have preferred Biden. The fact that Warren and Sanders are his chief rivals — rather than Harris and Buttigieg — may reflect the radicalization of some segments of the Democratic electorate. But much of the rank and file evinces little interest in their party’s ideological divides. And a significant portion of Democratic-base voters still espouse a preference for ideological moderation (however hazily defined).

Finally, even if the left were to build enthusiastic majoritarian support for a radical break with “Obamaism” among both Democratic-primary voters and the general public, it might still have difficulty enacting its legislative agenda. Both chambers of Congress overrepresent the most conservative elements in American society. And with its six-year terms and immense incumbency advantages, the Senate largely insulates Democrats in even the bluest states from grassroots pressure (see: Feinstein, Dianne).

The left is too weak to enact Sanders’s or Warren’s big plans. Do either of them have a plan for that?

Much of the time, the Democratic left is content to wage its “Bernie vs. Warren” civil war in a parallel universe free of this context. Sanders supporters comb through the Warren campaign’s every utterance on health care for intimations of agnosticism on single-payer, as though the chief obstacle to Medicare for All in 2021 will be the next Democratic president’s lack of backbone rather than the fact that there are currently 14 votes for Bernie’s bill in Chuck Schumer’s caucus (and none of the Democrats who oppose single-payer had any trouble winning renomination in the 2018 primaries). Meanwhile, progressive intellectuals debate the relative merits of Warren’s left-liberalism and Sanders’s “democratic socialism” as though the central question facing the next Democratic administration will be whether to implement the Meidner plan or settle for Denmark’s model of social democracy.

This isn’t to say that there are no areas where Warren’s and Sanders’s disparate worldviews and personal backgrounds could have real substantive implications. The commander-in-chief has immense discretion over foreign policy, and up to now Sanders appears more interested than Warren in radically reforming the Democratic Party’s approach to geopolitics. The president also has considerable power to shape domestic policy through regulatory appointments and creative interpretations of existing statutory authority — forms of “lawfare” to which Warren may be especially well suited.

Given how far the left is from possessing the power it will need to turn its wildest “green dreams” into reality, however, the most worthwhile Bernie-versus-Warren arguments may concern tactics, not policy. Whether Sanders’s approach to expropriating the billionaire class is preferable to Warren’s isn’t a question that’s likely to be of much practical consequence in the medium-term future. But whether his approach to winning elections — and using his power to build up the left’s — is more viable than Warren’s absolutely is.

In recent days, the staunchly pro-Sanders publication Jacobin has made the latter case, arguing that Sanders’s theory of change is both radically distinct from and superior to Warren’s. Refreshingly, the socialist magazine premises its argument on a frank acknowledgement of the left’s sorry state. In its account, Warren may have been a suitable agent of structural change three decades ago, when the grassroots left was still strong enough to arrange “a tense but functional relationship between a reformist administration in the White House and a strong and organized working class that could at least challenge capital’s imperatives.” But in the current context, the left doesn’t command enough divisions to make use of Warren’s technocratic gifts. It needs foot soldiers, not plans. And Bernie Sanders is uniquely capable of reassembling the left’s army because of his deeper commitment to radical, bottom-up change, his greater appeal to blue-collar constituencies, and his more unabashedly adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party.

I find this unconvincing. But Jacobin’s case merits examination, as it’s focused on the right questions: How do we get from where we are to a polity in which our plans actually matter? And is Warren or Sanders more likely to get us there?

The differences between Sanders and Warren may be smaller than they appear (in Jacobin articles, anyway).

One obstacle to a productive debate over whether Warren or Sanders is a more viable agent of change is the temptation to exaggerate the distinctions between their respective modes of operation. In “Elizabeth Warren’s Strategy Within the Democratic Party Is All Wrong,” Jacobin’s (typically incisive) Branko Marcetic falls prey to that impulse. In his column, Marcetic argues that the Massachusetts senator’s reported outreach to the Democratic Establishment betrays her commitment to an “inside strategy” that is bound to fail. The problem with his argument is that its central premise — that Warren’s decision to court power players in the Democratic Party sharply distinguishes her campaign from Sanders’s — appears to be false.

Marcetic’s essay is based on a New York Times story from last month that reported that, in an apparent bid to ingratiate herself with superdelegates, Warren had told influential Democratic brokers that she wanted to build power within the party and wouldn’t be assembling her own independent grassroots army. Sanders’s supporters responded to this news with (gleeful) indignation, as it appeared to heighten the contradictions between his and her theories of change. And yet, the most significant difference ostensibly established by the Times article — that Warren was forswearing the kind of independent organizing that Sanders champions — wasn’t actually any distinction at all. Oddly, Marcetic concedes this point in a parenthetical but declines to address its implications for his broader argument:

On August 26, the New York Times reported that Warren has been aggressively courting Democratic officials behind the scenes, assuring them, in the paper’s telling, that she is a loyal Democrat and does not plan to create her own political or organizing infrastructure outside the party. (The next day, the Association of State Democratic Committees announced that Sanders and a number of other candidates have, like Warren, pledged not to create “any organizing or messaging infrastructure that is parallel or duplicative” to the DNC or state parties.)

Marcetic proceeds to suggest that, even if Warren’s pledge is not as distinctive as it first appeared, her courting of superdelegates is:

Besides trying to convince Democrats that her progressive ideas won’t make her “unelectable,” Warren’s private assurances that she simply wants to breathe new life into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and help the party recapture Congress, the Times notes, also have a politically strategic element. Thanks to a rule change last year, if no single candidate wins an outright majority of delegates in the primaries — a plausible scenario in this crowded field — the superdelegates will once again have a large role in choosing the nominee, this time on the second ballot. And, should it come down to a second ballot, Warren wants their votes.

It’s unclear how easily these overtures to the DNC will sit with Warren’s plans for major structural change in the United States.

This distinction, too, is nonexistent: In May, a Sanders-campaign aide told BuzzFeed News, “We’re taking superdelegates and superdelegates strategy seriously, hence having a team dedicated to delegates who can prepare for multiple convention scenarios. We will be reaching out to them over the course of the campaign. When the senator wins the nomination, he’s eager to work with them to support and unite all the party in the general and beyond.”

There is nothing especially telling about a candidate’s seeking the approval of powerful figures in the party whose nomination he or she is trying to win. To neglect such “inside” tactics would be political malpractice, as the Sanders campaign readily acknowledges.

Nevertheless, differences between each candidate’s relationship with the Democratic Party persist.

All this said, it is true that, as a general matter, Sanders has a more adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party than Warren. He has, of course, refused to join the party for the duration of his congressional career, and he has used that formal independence to criticize the Democratic Establishment with a (generally righteous) fury that Warren has reserved for financial executives. He has also made some efforts to build an independent political infrastructure capable of challenging incumbent Democrats that refuse to get with his program (though he has apparently promised to suspend those efforts upon winning the nomination).

Given these facts, it isn’t wholly implausible to view the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate as a proxy for a broader dispute over the left’s relationship to the Democratic Party. Namely: Should progressives and socialists seek to co-opt the Democratic brand, build power within its institutions, and seek accommodation with its leadership, out of a recognition that the left is strong enough (and, for now, ideologically fashionable enough) to exert influence as one interest group within the Democrats’ big tent but far too weak to establish an independent political identity capable of capturing the loyalties of the Democratic base? Or is the Democratic brand too toxic with the working class — and its leadership too entrenched and aligned with capital — to be worth co-opting? Which is to say: Is popularizing a socialist identity that can bridge America’s partisan divide and mobilize its nonvoters — while building an independent party-like entity capable of disciplining its candidates and putting the fear of obsolescence into the Democratic leadership — the only path to radical reform?

It is not clear to me that Sanders is personally committed to the latter theory of change (given his aforementioned pledge, and decades of productive cooperation with the Democratic leadership, it seems possible that becoming blue America’s standard-bearer would dispel his reservations about working within the two-party system). But many of his most enthusiastic, socialist supporters are; Jacobin’s editors, and many members of the DSA, proselytize an electoral strategy of building an independent socialist party that competes on the Democratic ballot line when necessary. And even if a President Sanders does not directly participate in that project, the election of a self-avowed socialist would surely abet such efforts more than that of a staunchly pro-market progressive Democrat.

So, for the sake of argument, let’s stipulate that Bernie plans to violate his pledges and brook no compromise with the Democrats’ old regime. What is the evidence for the premise that forswearing all accommodation with the Democratic Party would maximize the left’s gains?

Toward the end of his column, Marcetic gestures at one answer:

An insurgent movement like the Tea Party made heavy use of confrontational tactics and primary challenges to wrench the Republican Party toward its end of the political spectrum. Donald Trump’s antagonistic relationship with a GOP establishment that largely opposed him didn’t stop him from both winning the Republican primary and the general election, and today’s GOP has been refashioned in Trump’s image, with even his fiercest Republican critics now fully signing on to his agenda. Trump did this not by convincing members of the GOP establishment that he was correct, but by rallying voters and making it virtually impossible for Republicans to both keep their jobs and oppose him. If the next Democratic president fails to achieve something similar, they won’t just face an obstructionist Republican bloc, but a host of conservative Democrats who will stand as a barrier to their agenda, just as Obama did in 2009…Only a direct challenge to the power of those elites will enable a progressive president to overcome it.

There are several problems with this analogy. First, it is not clear why pursuing diplomacy with Establishment factions — while seeking control of a party’s apparatus — is incompatible with abetting some primary challenges (Warren’s staff has significant ties to the organization Justice Democrats, which exists to orchestrate such campaigns). Second, Donald Trump absolutely sought reconciliation with the GOP Establishment upon winning his party’s nomination in 2016, noticeably adjusted his platform to suit its wishes, and owed his victory largely to the strength of the RNC’s infrastructure (his own campaign being a ramshackle mess). Third, Trump’s fiercest critics have not actually “fully” signed on to his agenda. In fact, Republican senators have repeatedly rebuffed the president on his signature issue, voting down Trump’s proposed reductions in legal immigration by wide margins. One might therefore interpret Trump as a testament to the limitations of the inside game. But then does anyone really believe that America’s nativists would be exercising more power in our politics had they begrudged Trump his accommodations with the GOP’s corporate wing or attempted to popularize an independent political identity, instead of seeking to claim the Republican Party as their own? And can anyone argue that Trump has been too soft on his intraparty critics?

The lesson of Trump’s failure to rally Republican senators behind his immigration agenda is that it is extremely hard to force a U.S. senator to vote for something he or she strongly opposes — whether through direct challenges or backroom cajoling. Six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and, in many cases, the ability to obstruct all of a president’s other priorities make it very hard for a White House to hold any senator’s feet to the fire. Putting the fear of a credible primary challenge into all 33 of the Democratic senators who’ve withheld their support for Bernie’s health-care bill looks implausible on its face. And given the left’s showing in House races in 2018 (not to mention its sorry efforts at Senate challenges), the task appears even more implausible upon closer examination.

The left’s weakness makes it trivially easy to demonstrate how someone else’s approach to creating radical change will prove inadequate. It is much harder to make a persuasive case for one’s own. Sanders supporters are right that nothing less than a political revolution can make Medicare for All and a Green New Deal realities. But the evidence that Bernie is capable of fomenting such a revolution is limited. On the one hand, Sanders has assembled impressive small-dollar donor armies and volunteer networks. His ascent has undoubtedly abetted DSA’s growth. And he has used his vast email list to recruit reinforcements for various labor actions and protests, thereby demonstrating his commitment to social movements and to non-electoral forms of political contestation.

On the other hand, Sanders has had a national platform for three years now. He has built up an independent organization and traveled the country proselytizing for class struggle. And none of it has been sufficient for his acolytes to dominate Democratic primaries, or to win him a broader base of support for his 2020 run than he had in 2016, or even to keep his approval rating from slipping underwater. Although one can point to some polls showing Sanders with an enviable favorability rating, RealClearPolitics’ polling average shows the public disapproving of the socialist senator by a margin of 46.3 to 43.1 percent. It is possible that Sanders’s popularity and influence will balloon once he attains power. But it’s worth noting that even Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s historic popularity — and the existence of strong labor, socialist, and communist movements — were insufficient to render FDR’s attempted “purge” of anti–New Deal Democrats in the 1938 primaries successful.

In light of these facts, is it not conceivable that a president more closely aligned with the Democratic Party — and less openly hostile to its key power centers — would actually be able to get senators like Jon Tester and Kyrsten Sinema to swallow marginally more progressive legislation in 2021 than a president with an independent political identity who projected contempt for their wing of the party? Put differently, would such senators feel more inclined to perform their independence from a socialist president who’d deliberately stoked the enmity of centrist Democrats, or a “capitalist to her bones” progressive president who’d nursed Third Wayers’ threatened egos?

I do not want to live in a republic where maximizing the number of Americans with quality health insurance requires buttering up Joe Manchin in back rooms. But are we sure that that isn’t the republic we’ll be living in for the foreseeable future?

To be sure, many of Sanders’s socialist supporters see their project as a generational one. And the incremental benefits of maximizing the left’s clout in the Democratic Party today (with all the distasteful, coalition-solidifying compromises that ostensibly requires) may pale next to the radical possibilities that militancy could open up tomorrow. After all, even if righteous intransigence does not immediately inspire a mobilization capable of cowing centrist Democrats, the struggle could facilitate the recruitment of progressives into the independent, mass-membership socialist party, a development sought by Jacobin. And yet, even if the goal is to maximize the left’s power in 2030, it’s not obvious why building a party-like structure outside of the Democratic tent is a more promising strategy than competing for authority within it.

As Jacobin’s Seth Ackerman has ably explained, American election law treats the two major parties as state institutions and uses discriminatory ballot-access rules to stymie third parties. For this reason, he insists that socialists make peace with competing on the Democratic ballot line, even as they build a “a membership-run organization with its own name, its own logo, its own identity and therefore its own platform, and its own ideology.” And yet the institutionalization of the two major parties, combined with partisan polarization, makes the task of popularizing an alternative, left-wing political identity enormously difficult. The American left will achieve nothing without the backing of the black working class. And while not all African-Americans proudly identify as Democrats, a very hefty percentage of them feel a profound loyalty to the party of civil rights and Barack Obama. And the same is true for many of the left’s other key constituencies. At present, the Democratic Party is an institution that manages to put Latinx housekeepers in Las Vegas in coalition with white industrial laborers in Dearborn, black church ladies in Charleston, and long-winded politics bloggers in Manhattan. The party’s infrastructure is relatively porous on the local level, where even the most formidable Democratic “machines” have proved unable to fend off challenges from charismatic bartenders. And while the party’s base voters have strong partisan identities, many are open to a wide range of definitions of what it means to be a true Democrat in ideological terms; some recent surveys suggest Bernie Sanders is the most popular second choice among Joe Biden backers.

Given these conditions, why isn’t commandeering the Democratic Party’s infrastructure, platform, and considerable social base not a simpler, faster, and more viable path to power than attempting to build an entirely new party and political identity and then hijacking the Democrats’ ballot line — in the ostensible hope that voters who affirmatively choose to register as Democrats will look more favorably on leftist primary challengers who disparage their party than on candidates who claim membership in it?

Proletarians prefer L.L. Bean?

In “Elizabeth Warren Is Thirty Years Too Late,” Connor Kilpatrick and Bhaskar Sunkara do not address this question directly. But their analysis suggests that the existing Democratic coalition is too heavily reliant on affluent voters for the party to serve as an effective vehicle of radical change, and that Bernie’s relative distance from the taint of the Democratic brand and greater affinity for class politics and bottom-up organizing make him uniquely capable of winning back the legions of working-class voters whom Third Way Democrats lost to right-wing populism or political apathy.

Like Marcetic’s piece, Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s draws strong conclusions from limited evidence. The authors observe that Sanders’s support among Democratic-primary voters is markedly less white and more working-class than Warren’s. In fact, many surveys have suggested that Warren owes her viability to overwhelming support among professional-class white liberals — or, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara describe them, “Patagonia Democrats.” This distinction between the class composition of the two progressive candidates’ nascent coalitions has become a popular talking point among Sanders supporters. And it may have some validity. In Vermont, Sanders has regularly outperformed other Democrats with white, non-college-educated voters. It’s plausible that his brand of politics may play better with a critical mass of secular, rural, white swing voters in Wisconsin, and therefore that he would be a stronger general-election candidate than Warren.

But Kilpatrick and Sunkara use this polling data to make a far more sweeping claim. Sanders’s greater appeal with blue-collar Democratic-primary voters doesn’t merely suggest he can improve on Clinton’s margins in Kenosha County, but that he can reorient the polarization of U.S. politics along class lines. In their telling, Warren’s coalition is potentially broad “enough to keep Republicans from the White House but not Congress or state legislatures. It would be yet another coalition that could win but never govern.” Bernie’s working-class coalition, by contrast, would have the numbers and self-interest necessary to force radical change through political institutions that were designed to thwart it.

That America’s low- and middle-income workers do not share a class consciousness or partisan coalition is a genuine constraint on radical economic reform. Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s commitment to overcoming that constraint is commendable. But the fact that Sanders commands the loyalties of a disproportionately working-class 16 percent of the Democratic-primary electorate scarcely qualifies as evidence that his appeal with non-college-educated voters is so powerful it can radically realign American politics. After all, Biden boasts even stronger support among nonwhite and working-class Democrats. Does that mean that nominating Uncle Joe would reassemble the New Deal coalition? Sanders supporters might dismiss the racial and socioeconomic diversity of Biden’s support as a product of mere name recognition. But Warren backers can play that card against Sanders too: In the last week, multiple polls have shown her not only gaining more non-college-educated and non-white support as her campaign rolls on, but actually outperforming Sanders with such voters.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

Regardless, the evidence that no Democratic candidate can drastically change the party’s class composition in the near term is considerable. The movement of non-college-educated white voters to the right — and college-educated white ones to the left — is not an exceptionally American phenomenon. Rather, it has been happening for decades across much of Western Europe. The left attributes this development to center-left parties’ myriad betrayals of their working-class constituencies in the neoliberal era. And that is certainly part of the story. But it is also the case that non-college-educated white voters in the West have, in the aggregate, long evinced a preference for restricted immigration in opinion polls. It’s conceivable that, irrespective of economic policy, the demographic shifts of the past three decades were bound to increase the salience of immigration in partisan politics and thus drive a significant portion of the white working class away from center-left parties with bases in diverse urban centers.

But whatever the origins of this development, there is little evidence that left-wing parties can rapidly reverse it by embracing more robustly class-conscious rhetoric and ambitiously redistributionist economic policies. When Britain’s Labour Party elected a democratic socialist as its leader and campaigned on its most radical manifesto in a generation, it gained a historic number of seats in the 2017 general election — by, among other things, flipping Tory-held districts in the wealthiest parts of London. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, the bulk of Sanders-aligned, working-class House candidates in 2018 did not have much more success at winning non-college-educated white voters than did centrist Democrats running in similar districts (Richard Ojeda notwithstanding). None of this means that the left must give up on uniting the bulk of America’s multiethnic working class into a single party. But it does suggest that such a project may require years of patient organizing (and demographic replacement), rather than the nomination of any particular presidential candidate.

If Kilpatrick and Sunkara overestimate Sanders’s capacity to realign American politics, they understate how much the Democratic Party can accomplish with its existing coalition. The U.S. economy does not currently serve the average college-educated voter very well. And most of the marquee items on Sanders’s agenda are in the objective self-interest of virtually all affluent suburbanites. Charles Koch may have little use for free public college, universal health care, more generous Social Security benefits, or child-care subsidies. But the typical upper-middle-class family does. Meanwhile, the indebted and underemployed millennial sons and daughters of the professional middle class are one of the most reliably left-wing constituencies in the country and make up no small percentage of Jacobin’s subscriber base and DSA’s membership. There are limitations on what this coalition can achieve. But in California, the existing Democratic coalition just secured subsidized health care for undocumented immigrants and employment rights for exploited “gig economy” workers, over the furious objections of multibillion-dollar companies. Under Barack Obama, meanwhile, it extended Medicaid to millions of people, likely saving nearly 20,000 working-class Americans from premature deaths. The lamentable shortcomings of Obama’s tenure do not nullify that achievement.

Sunkara and Kilpatrick are right to find no contentment in such marginal gains. But by projecting contempt for one of the voting blocs that made those gains possible — and asserting that the existing Democratic Party can “never govern” — they risk projecting an air of indifference toward such reforms and the working-class people who’ve benefited from them (an indifference that I know neither writer actually feels). Socialists must always guard against the impression that they are more invested in chasing an ideological abstraction than delivering concrete benefits to the exploited classes they claim to champion. As a wise (and/or violently racist and jingoistic) man once said, “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” For many Democratic-primary voters, expressions of contempt for the organization that represents their best line of defense against racist, reactionary rule can be deeply alienating. Which points to the most immediate strategic upside of Warren’s “inside strategy”: Polls have repeatedly found that Sanders attracts a relatively high level of disapproval or discomfort among Democratic-primary voters, while Warren boasts an aberrantly low one. This reality, combined with the intensity of elite Democratic opposition to Sanders, invites the question of whether Warren is the only progressive with sufficient breadth of appeal (among Democratic voters and power brokers) to prevent Biden from securing the nomination — in which case Sanders’s theoretical superiority as a general-election candidate or president would be moot. The answer to that question is far from clear, in my view. But it’s hard to see how Sanders can negate its premise without stepping up his “inside game.”

All this may read as an elaborate endorsement of Warren. But I do not intend it as such. That Sanders evinces more interest in radically revising American foreign policy is no small thing. Further, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara note, in a context where the left is materially weak, the personal ideological commitments of elected leaders take on a heightened importance. And there is no question that Bernie Sanders has a more deeply rooted ideological commitment to radical politics than does Elizabeth Warren.

But too many prominent arguments for Sanders’s superiority consist of easily debunked distinctions between the two left-wing candidates or blithely unsubstantiated assertions that Bernie is uniquely capable of fomenting a political revolution and thus of bending the Democratic Establishment and U.S. Senate to his will. The first mode of argument risks alienating undecided liberals and obscuring Sanders’s genuinely distinctive merits. The second threatens to replace rigorous reflection on the obstacles to radical change in the United States with magical thinking — and a much-needed debate over how to overcome those impediments with the recitation of rival dogmas.

Which would be unfortunate. In this country, optimism of the intellect is a luxury that no “Champagne socialist” nor “Patagonia progressive” can afford."

In total, the Trump campaign and its backers spent between $346,700 and $1,430,182 on more than 2,000 ads for its Facebook page from Monday to midday Friday, according to data analyzed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. She obtained the data through Facebook’s public ad archive, which reports all of its data in ranges, not precise figures. Those ads had been viewed between 13.3 million and 25.3 million times, the NYU analysis found.

On Tuesday and Wednesday alone, the campaign shelled out about $500,000 on Facebook ads, according to figures tallied by ACRONYM, a digital outfit focused on liberal causes. On Wednesday alone it spent about $350,000, an amount it typically spends in a week.

The online offensive offered a window into Trump’s bare-knuckle approach to the coming impeachment battles, as he took the showdown to his favored terrain: the Internet. Already, campaign officials say they have filled their coffers with contributions: Eric Trump, the president’s second son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said Thursday that the campaign had raised $8.5 million in the previous 24 hours.

The Facebook ads, which traffic in claims found to be false by The Washington Post Fact Checker, also provided a new test for the technology giant after it reaffirmed this week it would exempt speech by politicians from fact checking. That exemption, company executives said, also applies to ads, though sponsored posts are required to meet community standards that proscribe threats as well as “content aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive another of money, property, or legal right.”

On Friday, Facebook said none of the ads violated its policies, including those that prohibit dehumanizing speech, though the company did not detail its reasoning. A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

As Trump flooded social media with impeachment-related advertising, would-be challengers competing for the Democratic nomination moved gingerly on the platforms. While it appeared that every one of the hundreds of ads placed by Trump’s campaign since Tuesday used the word “impeachment,” not a single ad placed by Joe Biden, the former vice president, used the word. Biden said this week he would favor impeachment proceedings if the White House tried to thwart congressional oversight activities.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala D. Harris of California, both of whom had previously called for the president’s impeachment, each ran ads on the topic but far fewer than the general fundraising appeals they released that made no mention of the president.

In ads targeting mainly women, Warren asked users to sign a petition calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. Harris asked users, mainly in California, to sign a card thanking Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the speaker of the House, “for showing the leadership the White House lacks by beginning an impeachment inquiry.”

Biden, who became the subject of a July conversation between Trump and the president of Ukraine, placed new ads condemning the president for soliciting help from a foreign leader to smear him. But Biden stopped short of mentioning impeachment.

In addition to the individual candidates, the national party committees produced dueling advertising on the topic, with the Democratic National Committee asking users to donate to show their support for an impeachment inquiry and the Republican National Committee asking users to “stand against impeachment.” The GOP’s ads appeared to target in particular a swath of states in the Midwest, as well as New York, Pennsylvania and Maine.

The RNC said Friday it would join the Trump campaign in spending a total of $10 million across television and digital platforms assailing Democrats for beginning an impeachment inquiry. The campaign will spend $8 million, while the party will kick in another $2 million.

For months, Facebook spending on impeachment has been dominated by Tom Steyer, the investor turned impeachment activist, and his super PAC, Need to Impeach. Warren has been next in line, spending about $34,000 on the issue between Aug. 31 and Sept. 21, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic communications agency.

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Ben: Over the last few months, Joe Biden has managed to fend off persistent criticism about his record, his handsiness, and his age, among other things, maintaining a consistent lead in Democratic primary polls all the while. But with the explosion of the Trump-Ukraine revelations, he finds himself in the middle of a scandal that’s really about the president’s corruption — but which also makes him an easy target for the right, who claim that he and his son Hunter are the real villains in all this. Meanwhile, in a possibly related development, Elizabeth Warren is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire. Is this whole thing a curse for Biden?

Gabriel: There’s definitely a lot going on here, but first let’s note: Warren’s upward trend has been going on for quite a long time. It’s not like she’s shot up in the polls as Trump has pushed his line on Biden’s “scandal” — which, let’s also be clear, there’s still no evidence to support is a real one. All that said, it’s hard to see how this is a net positive for Biden if it continues to be covered and thought about like it has been so far. His team has made a fairly persuasive case that Trump has been so focused on Biden, including in pushing this Ukraine theory, because he is most worried about him in a general election. That, of course, makes sense: Just look at the preliminary polling that shows Biden beating Trump consistently. This is great for Biden’s central message of electability. However, a lot of the coverage — i.e., the way real voters are consuming this saga — has nonetheless put new scrutiny on Biden’s son, Hunter, in a way that’s hard for Biden to defend, even if the actual substance of Hunter’s work wasn’t illegal, and the specific accusations about Joe Biden, as vice-president, interfering in Ukrainian investigations is unfounded.

But I think it’s instructive to look at how Biden himself is talking about all this. Here he is at a fundraiser in California yesterday: “Now, I know that even though there’s not been one single shred of evidence substantiating any accusation made, and today, the leading prosecutor, the headline in the Washington Post was, the prosecutor in, that they’re trying to convince to say something differently, in, in Ukraine said there’s nothing anybody in my family did wrong or at all. But folks, this isn’t about me. It’s never been about me. It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives. Health care, education, the godawful rampant gun violence that’s going on, and maybe the single most important consequential thing is climate change. So I’m not going to let him do it. This is not about me, this is about the American people and the issues that matter to them.”

This was after he recounted the actual big deal here: Trump’s call, and the whistle-blower’s report. So Biden clearly wants to talk about his own family … not at all.

Ben: Right. And he seemed a little bit tentative in his initial response to all this, which is a bit odd, considering the gravity and outrageousness of what the president was trying to do to him.

Gabriel: It’s useful to think of it all in the context of Biden’s whole career and political persona. He is very, very, very protective of his family, understandably, and simultaneously very invested in what he perceives to be his image as a straight shooter. So this is a double whammy.

Again, though, there’s no evidence that the accusations are true. Can’t stress that enough. So it’s understandable that there are a lot of nerves in Democratic circles that analysts/pundits are talking around that fact and immediately jumping to: doesn’t this look bad for Biden? I can’t tell you how many Clinton ‘16 alums have made a complaint like that to me in recent days. Not complaining about Biden’s actions, to be clear, but about how Trump has warped the public discussion around him to drag his opponent down.

Ben: So you’re saying the allegations might be true? #democrathoax

Gabriel: You’ll have to check the transcript memo.

Ben: Yes, it is crazy-making that we’re all aware of the game Trump is playing, and then we have to do this kind of meta-questioning of whether it’s working. I mean, I’m doing that right now. But, as I was saying to our colleague Ed yesterday, logic and fairness and rationality isn’t really the name of the game in politics, especially at the moment.

Gabriel: Well, I think it’s not crazy to assert that Biden’s entire pitch is based on the premise that you’ll be proven wrong about that.

Ben: That rationality is making a comeback?

Gabriel: That reason will prevail.

Ben: It may, but there will still be a dangerously high level of silliness floating around.

Gabriel: All this said, I think there’s a real question about how other Democratic candidates talk about this.

There’s already been some obvious discomfort. Warren was asked if her VP’s son could work abroad like Hunter Biden, and she initially said no, then said she had to check her plan to be sure. Castro has basically just defended Biden and refused to engage. No one has said “this is corrupt!” or agreed with Trump, obviously, but they’re proceeding with immense caution.

Ben: Yeah, it’s a bit like the age issue. Pressing it too overtly is likely to backfire, as Castro recently learned.

Reporting indicates that Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats want to do this impeachment thing pretty quickly. Do you get the sense that the Biden camp is relieved about that fact? That by the time Iowa rolls around, the process might already be over?

Gabriel: It’s very hard to tell, I think they’re still trying to figure it out, just like everyone else. If you’re a leading candidate, though, the prospect of an impeachment proceeding playing out during the primaries is a bit scary, since the politics of the impeachment are completely up in the air. It’s just an unpredictable landscape. That said, obviously Biden’s team doesn’t want “Biden,” “corruption,” “Ukraine,” “investigation” to show up in context-free headlines for the next six months (even if the other words in the headline are “Trump” “impeach,” etc.), but realistically the ongoing impeachment process is likely to move the national focus even further away from the narrow question of Hunter Biden’s work, anyway. Republicans may continue to press on the Biden accusations, but that’s likely the case, no matter how long the impeachment inquiry takes.

Ben: Biden hasn’t been shy about going after Trump directly — his whole early strategy was to paint the president as a sui generis monster, which was in contrast to some of his rivals, who tended not to focus so much on the president (until they saw how well it was working for Biden). Could this episode work to his advantage in that it provides more evidence that Trump simply needs to be thrown out of office, and the one person who can do that is Joe?

Gabriel: That’s what Biden is betting. Look at what his campaign manager said to Politico for a story this morning: “Why are you punching someone? Because you’re afraid of them.” The question is how Biden communicates that to voters without amplifying Trump’s attacks. And, just as importantly, how other candidates counter it without feeding into Trump’s line of argument.

Ben: To return to Warren: Perhaps the clearest sign yet of her threat to Biden is that his campaign is reportedly mulling a wealth tax, cribbing a page from her (and Bernie Sanders’s) playbook. Does this strike you as a sound political strategy?

Gabriel: I mean, he’s been saying over and over at private fundraisers, surrounded by rich people: Don’t expect anything from me, I’m not going to make your lives easier. So no one is going to start thinking of Biden as a crusader against the one percent, obviously, but it may soften some of the criticisms from the left, just a tiny bit. We don’t know what this’ll look like, yet, though. Reports just have his advisers “considering” the move. It’s not like he’s trying to win over the Bernie ‘16 crowd, just to prove he gets it. And FWIW I think the clearest sign of her threat to Biden is her beating him in polling.

Ben: Fair enough.

Gabriel: Going back to how Biden talks about all this, and everyone else responds, for a sec: We may have just gotten a very consequential development. CNN and the Times, who are co-hosting the next debate, just announced that it’ll be one night only. And we know that there are almost certainly going to be 12 candidates onstage, which by definition means candidates will have less time than ever to actually talk, unless the debate is, like, four hours long. There’s no way Trump’s impeachment doesn’t come up pretty prominently, obviously, so we’ll see soon how candidates talk about Biden’s side of this. What do you think would be an effective way for a long shot who needs Biden to falter to answer the question?

Ben: The questionee has become the questioner.

Were I a long-shot candidate, I don’t think my strategy would be to go after Biden directly on this issue. I don’t think it would engender any sympathy from Democratic voters — and this is the sort of thing that’s so thick in the air that it doesn’t need explicating. But perhaps you could get away with some more subtle questioning of Biden’s electability, which is his most powerful argument for the nomination. You could mention that Biden has a lot of baggage (which is true) without directly tying it to impeachment. What do you think?

Gabriel: You could try it, but the last three people to go after Biden in debates, however subtly or overtly, only got very momentary support, if any, out of doing it (Harris, Booker, Castro.) The most effective play in the eyes of voters might be to say exactly what Biden is saying: This is a distraction, and we can’t afford to be distracted. That’s saying something similar without actually saying it. But that’s also admitting Trump has way more power to set the conversation than you probably want to admit."

AMITE CITY, La.— The float carrying Gov. John Bel Edwards passed by quickly, and the tossed beads and campaign cups — “Putting Louisiana First” — landed a few feet short of Randy Foulks.

Foulks, the 68-year-old owner of an air conditioning company, likes Edwards. But he wasn't exactly jumping for campaign swag.

“I'm disappointed that he raised taxes when he said he wouldn't,” Foulks said. “I know he's got a big heart for this state. He took the bull by the horns when that storm came through here. But it's the taxes, man. Something's got to be done.”

Edwards, who was elected governor four years ago in a rout, is seeking a second term in a state that has largely moved away from Democrats. He has stayed far away from the party's presidential race, angered local and national Democrats by signing a strict abortion limitation law and expanded Medicaid. But he's in a tight battle for reelection against two Republicans running as allies of President Trump and enemies of a 2016 sales tax hike.

""[People] may not agree with everything that we've done,” Edwards said in an interview. “But you cannot, with any justification, say that Louisiana's not better off. We are running surpluses now, not deficits. We have an uninsured rate that's lower than the national average. Now, who would have thought that would ever be possible in the state of Louisiana?”

Louisiana's Oct. 12 election will test whether a socially conservative Democrat can still get elected in the South — whether it's still possible to excite liberal voters, mollify conservative voters and hold onto a job. With abortion practically off the table, Republicans have attacked Edwards's support for LGBT nondiscrimination laws. With unemployment falling under 5 percent, they credit the president's tax cuts and ask why Edwards can't govern more like Trump.

“We're the only state in the nation that lost jobs in the last 12 months,” said Rep. Ralph Abraham, the leading Republican candidate, in an interview from the sidelines of a Louisiana Tech football game. “He's got to own this stuff.” The congressman, who like Edwards is a military veteran, was there for one of the game's multiple salutes to the troops.

Republicans, who dominate Louisiana's state legislature, always saw Edwards as an accidental governor. He won 56 percent of the vote against Sen. David Vitter; one year later, Hillary Clinton won just 39 percent of the vote in the state. In 2015, Edwards benefited from two factors that disappeared right after the election: the unpopularity of two-term Gov. Bobby Jindal and the candidacy of Vitter. The senator, who had won reelection after admitting to paying for prostitutes (“a serious sin in my past”), was particularly vulnerable to Edwards's character-first campaign.

“The choice for governor couldn't be clearer,” one of Edwards's TV ads declared. “John Bel Edwards, who answered our country's call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute's call, minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers.”

Edwards's two opponents this year, Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, have no such problems. Abraham's campaign has emphasized his work as a family doctor; Republicans call him “Doc” more than they call him “Ralph.”

The wealthy Rispone is running as an outsider, the closest thing state Republicans can get to their own Trump. Rispone has spent millions on ads attacking Edwards over “sanctuary cities” and even a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill; he's also gone after Abraham, dredging up an accusation that he used his salary to buy a plane instead of donating the income to charity. (The attack, previously used by Democrats, ignores that Abraham did give his salary to charity until congressional ethics prevented him from taking income from his medical practice.)

“I'm the grandson of legal immigrants, who worked hard and played by the rules” Rispone says in one of his omnipresent TV spots, drawling the word “legal” for emphasis.

If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff. Edwards has consistently polled north of 40 percent, with his rivals in the 20s. But Republicans like their chances with either Abraham or Rispone, who have tag-teamed Edwards as a tax hiker who can't be trusted on social issues. The strategy is twofold: hoping that Democrats are less enthused to support an antiabortion governor and firing up the Republican vote by warning of “sanctuary cites,” crime waves and a breakdown of gender norms in the state's schools.

“As a doctor,” Abraham says in one TV spot, “I can assure you there are only two genders.”

Edwards has responded by constantly reminding voters of why their taxes went up at all — Jindal had blown up the state's deficit and Republicans got on board with the tax hike.

“We had already cut higher education deeper than any other state in the nation,” he said. “We'd already raised tuition more than any other state in the nation. People know that. The economy wasn't working.” Edwards has stood behind a gas tax increase that's supported by a plurality of voters but stalled in the legislature. In the first debate, he made a lonely promise not to cut taxes “until we know that we won’t go back into a structural budget deficit.”

Medicaid expansion, which Edwards brought to the state by executive action, hasn't reshaped the race. Republicans have not said outright that they'd reverse it, even as they support a lawsuit led by Republican attorneys general that would rip up the Affordable Care Act. (Louisiana's attorney general, Jeff Landry, is simultaneously suing to kill the ACA and promising to protect its most popular components.)

Republicans are not running against Medicaid expansion per se, focusing instead on troubles with how it was implemented and on the theory that it's better to get insurance through private employers than the government.

“Look, I'm a family doctor,” Abraham said. “There are those that need that safety net. We will take care of those people. My beef is that we've got over a hundred million dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse, and we've got over 1,600 people on the Medicaid rolls who are making over $100,000.” Abraham and other Republicans have attacked the implementation of expansion while navigating around the implications: that they would knock Louisianans off the Medicaid rolls.

A bill banning most abortions, which won't go into effect unless courts uphold a similar one in Mississippi, took a toll on the governor's Democratic support. Karen Carter Peterson, the state party chair and a member of the Democrats' legislative minority, even singled him out for criticism. But it also deprived Republicans of an issue, and they've spent the final weeks of the race with a different message to conservatives: Edwards is too lenient on LGBT rights.

Abraham described Edwards as two-faced on abortion — “he has a Planned Parenthood operative as his secretary of health” — but had even more to say about the state conducting a school survey that asked children about their sexual orientation.

“We need to let teachers teach and let the parents be the parents,” Abraham said. “If they want to have that discussion with their children, that's their business. The state should have no role in that agenda of social experimentation.”

Edwards has defended his support for gay rights, arguing that opposition will backfire on his opponents. “Discrimination and prejudice are not Louisiana values,” he said, when asked to respond to Abraham. “I think you have a candidate whose campaign is failing, and he's desperate, and he's trying to go back to some of those social wedge issues that have been used successfully in the past. That is not Louisiana today.”

On Saturday, as Edwards walked around the annual Fried Chicken Festival in New Orleans, his coalition came into view. Chrishelle DuPree, 46, rushed over to get a photo with her governor, even though she'd hated the abortion law.

“Abortion should be a woman's right,” Dupree said. “I totally don't agree with the governor on that. But I won't vote against him because of the abortion law. I was really pissed at first, but he's Catholic, so I understand it, and I can't let get a Republican in office. The hell with that!”

Moments later, the governor took a selfie with Steve Beatty, 64, who'd voted for Edwards in 2015 and then for Trump in 2016.

“I'm a Christian, and I believe every life needs a chance, like the governor,” Beatty explained. “I heard Franklin Graham say the night before the Trump election: You're not voting for Trump, you're voting for conservative values. I feel that way about the governor.”

But Edwards never supported Trump; in the final stretch, Republicans hope for that to make the difference, and point out that no incumbent governor who was forced into a runoff has won it. While Abraham has been massively outspent, his plan to win the runoff was for national attention to swing to Louisiana, and for the president to throw in behind him. Asked about the revelation that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president for dirt on Joe Biden's son, Abraham called it “the liberal media grasping at straws,” something that would not play in Louisiana.

“I want him down here,” Abraham said. “I want him to come down to Louisiana and have one of those MAGA rallies. He's welcome to come as many times as he wants.”

No national Democratic figure would be so welcome in Louisiana. Edwards had cheerfully ignored the party's race for president. Asked about the debate the 2020 candidates were having about Medicare-for-all, he emphasized that the current system was working for Louisiana. Asked about the president, he said he had worked with him plenty.

“I already got more than I can say grace over on my plate,” he said. “He typically doesn't go in the states where he's not going to win, and so I think he would be reluctant to come here. I would remind you that Democrats last year nationwide picked up seven new governorships. And I think the president went to just about all of those states.”

ON THE TRAIL

On Wednesday, the president defended his decision to ask Ukraine's new president for dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter.

Joe Biden has responded in two ways: calling all of this ridiculous and trying to return the focus to health care. Apart from an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show and some tart statements, the former vice president has stuck to his previous campaign plan, attacking the administration for undermining the Affordable Care Act.

“Many Republican legislatures and governors are dodging their duties to their constituents by rejecting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion opportunity,” he said in a Thursday morning statement. When he has talked about the Republican attempts to investigate Hunter Biden, it has been to talk about how the president's party is afraid of him.

“The reason I’m being attacked is most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,” Biden told donors via speakerphone Tuesday night. “So I’m not at all surprised I’ve become the object of his affection and attention. The attacks on me, they’re going to come and they’re going to go and they’ll soon be forgotten.”

The willingness of Republicans to attack Biden, and justify the president's approach, is raising one of the most important political questions of the primary: Have Democrats figured out what to do when Trump attacks?

Up to now, the president has been less relevant in primary politics than expected. Liberal activists — from the Sunrise Movement to Moms Demand Action to labor leaders — have been driving the policy conversation; the president has made cameos by attacking “socialism” or amplifying stories that ran in conservative media, rarely reaching Democrats, who tend to tune him out.

But the Ukraine story is taking Democrats to territory that to them feels both terrifyingly familiar and worryingly uncertain. Some in the party wonder whether angry voters will rally behind Biden, seeing the attacks as evidence that Trump doesn't want to run against him. Some worry that Republicans could weaponize Hunter Biden the way that they once weaponized Hillary Clinton's private email server.

“There are some Democrats who have 2016 PTSD,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, one of Biden's first supporters in Congress. “There were legitimate questions with the way that Hillary Clinton handled her email server. But in this case, come on: We're talking about something completely manufactured by a president who just committed the crime of extortion.”

The fight between Trump and Biden is asymmetrical; the president is almost unanimously supported in his party, while Biden's lead in the Democratic primary was slipping even before the Ukraine story. Of the 275 congressional Democrats who are not running for president, just 21 have endorsed Biden.

That's more than have endorsed any other candidate, but it's a fraction of the support Clinton had at this time in the race; by the time news broke about her use of a private email server, a majority of congressional Democrats had already endorsed her. It was in their interest to defend Clinton, whom they always saw as the likely nominee. They are not as sure what will happen to Biden. Even though they believe him, and not Trump, they have seen the president make stuff up and get away with it.

So far, most congressional Democrats and several of Biden's primary rivals have condemned Trump and defended the former vice president. At an appearance in California, Julián Castro directly compared what Trump was doing to the endless negativity of 2016: “Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.” Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, said no candidate should amplify what the president was saying about Biden.

“All Democratic candidates need to stand in solidarity against President Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Vice President Biden,” Khanna said. “Trump will smear whoever the Democratic nominee is, and Democrats must be united in rejecting his tawdry politics of hate, lies and personal attacks.”

“I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,” Sanders said in Iowa on Tuesday when asked whether he had concerns about Hunter Biden. Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment. You guys write very perceptive articles on these things and I’ll let you make that judgment.” One day later, asked whether her own ethics plan would allow the children of vice presidents to take lucrative foreign jobs, Warren said “no,” then admitted that she had to check the plan again. Neither statement had much solidarity with Biden.

Democratic voters, meanwhile, don't seem to be moving. At a meeting this week of Story County, Iowa, Democrats, opinion of the accusations against Biden — not the substance, but the risk — dovetailed with voters' own candidate preferences. Lisa Heddens, a 55-year-old supervisor, said it was deeply sad to see Biden’s family come under attack. She’d gotten to know the former vice president years earlier, when he got to know her son, who had an intellectual disability.

“He called my son when he was in the hospital. He invited us to the inauguration,” said Heddens, a longtime state legislator. “It is going to be a nasty, nasty election. But I think most of the electorate, most of the people, are tired of this stuff. And I think Joe, in particular, is in a good position to push back against it.”

But other Democrats, with fresh and painful memories of 2016, were more worried. Janet Wahl, 74, said at the same gathering that one reason she was supporting Warren over Biden was that she wanted “new blood” and hated to see Biden dragged into the fray.

“I feel it's horrible to do to anybody, and it’s horrible to do to him in particular,” Wahl said. “But Joe knew what he was getting into. He stepped up to do this again, and he knew how dirty politics could be.”

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, “Your Choice.” The Indiana Democrat's third Iowa spot conceals a negative message inside a positive one. “If you’re happy with the private insurance you’ve got, my plan would let you stick with it — if you want,” he says. “Now, others say it’s Medicare-for-all, or nothing.” This is the third ad Iowans will have seen from a presidential candidate warning them against Medicare-for-all. A spot from Joe Biden cryptically referred to politicians who want to “scrap” the Affordable Care Act, and one from Michael Bennet warned that ending private insurance “makes no sense.”

Tom Steyer, “Village.” The investor-turned-politico's latest ad emphasizes the need for Democrats to flip the Senate, name-checking two Republicans on the ballot next year (Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham) and one who isn't (Chuck Grassley). “It takes an entire village of politicians to rig the system,” Steyer says. “That’s why we need term limits; to make Washington work for you.” Term limits are part of Steyer's government change agenda, alongside national ballot measures that would let voters decide major issues; they have not recently been popular with Democratic voters.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (Berkeley IGS, 2,272 likely voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 29% ( 11)

Joe Biden — 20% (-2)

Bernie Sanders — 19% ( 2)

Kamala Harris — 8% (-5)

Pete Buttigieg — 6% (-4)

Beto O'Rourke — 3% (-)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% ( 1)

Andrew Yang — 2% ( 1)

Cory Booker — 1% (-)

Michael Bennet — 1% ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 1% ( 1)

Julián Castro — 1% (-)

Of several recent polls that have shown Elizabeth Warren battling Joe Biden for the lead in their primary, this might be the one with the most Warren-friendly news. The reason: California is the first racially diverse primary state where she has shown strength and where neither of her closest competitors has a dominating lead with nonwhite voters.

Here, Warren leads the field by 18 points among white non-Hispanic voters and by 14 points among Asian Americans. Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent. (Harris, whose mother immigrated to the United States from India, polls at only 5 percent with Asian Americans.)





Would you be excited if this candidate became the Democratic nominee? (Quinnipiac, 561 Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 70%

Joe Biden — 56%

Bernie Sanders — 55%

Kamala Harris — 49%

Pete Buttigieg — 46%

Warren's strength over the past month has shaken up some of the story lines about her support and which voters she could or could not appeal to within a Democratic primary. Recent Quinnipiac polls had asked about who voters saw as electable or who had better policy ideas; the excitement question comes at that a different way and, for the moment, finds Warren doing well with Democrats she hadn't appealed to previously.

Among white voters without college degrees and voters making less than $50,000, the percentage of “excited” voters is, respectively, 69 percent and 67 percent; for Sanders, it's 52 percent and 62 percent. By a 60-point margin, white voters with college degrees are excited about a Warren nomination, which clicks with stories about her appeal to white, suburban liberals.

Joe Biden. He has continued to campaign against the Trump administration’s waivers that allow conservative states to limit access to Medicaid, in between attacks from the president about Ukraine; he also announced a wave of endorsements from Iowa teachers as part of “Educators for Biden.”

Kamala Harris. She’s opening a campaign office in Oakland on Sunday, after a wave of polls have showed her falling behind in her home state and even in the Bay Area.

Julián Castro. He’s turning a weekend in Austin, where the Texas Tribune Festival is being held, into a major homecoming: an appearance at a Latino turnout rally, a stop at a voter turnout bus tour, and a “women for Castro” brunch.

Michael Bennet. He’s also speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, interviewed by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.

Amy Klobuchar. She’ll be in Austin over the weekend for the Texas Tribune Festival and the Voto Latino turnout event.

Beto O’Rouke. He’ll round out the Texas Tribune lineup, sitting for a Saturday interview with MSNBC’s Garrett Haake.

John Delaney. He’s making another trip to Iowa, with six weekend stops in six counties in the central part of the state.

Marianne Williamson. She’s spending Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas, joined at one stop by Richard Dreyfuss, who will “offer remarks about the power of civics in American public education.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

The race for labor's endorsement. Four years ago, as nearly every major union either endorsed Hillary Clinton's nomination or stayed neutral in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders got a lot of help from California. The Oakland-based National Nurses United got behind Sanders early and spent millions of dollars to support him; the smaller National Union of Health Care Workers, also based there, endorsed him handily.

This year, NNU hasn't made its pick yet, and the NUHW just finished an interactive endorsement process that ended with a split decision: Warren and Sanders. Candidates gave video interviews, then the union's 15,000 members voted online, with ballot space for three choices. Warren appeared on 61 percent ballots to 50 percent for Sanders, 34 percent for Kamala Harris, 32 percent for Joe Biden, 21 percent for Pete Buttigieg, and 12 percent for a true dark horse: Trump.

The split endorsement was mostly an embarrassment for Harris, who had won the union's support in her California races. It's also a good look at how the momentum of the race is affecting the endorsement process that most unions have only just begun. No candidate looks like a sure thing for the nomination, as Clinton did four years ago. Sanders, a dream candidate for labor in 2015, has lost ground against his rivals, one of whom (Warren) is equally appealing to some labor organizers. Sanders has made solidarity with workers a key component of his campaign, even using his voter contact list to drive support and attention toward strikes.

Still to be determined: whether unions with more conservative membership, such as the building trades, will follow more left-wing unions, or will find Biden's campaign more compelling.

Much has been made about Warren’s growing popularity with young voters — she stood in line for four hours earlier this month taking selfies with people who attended her speech near New York University. And while she is not polling as well with black voters as Biden or Sanders, she has growing support with the demographic, according to other polls.

As another friend and respected colleague comes out in favor of Warren, I recognize the black folk they keep polling who support Biden. But I don’t see them polling anyone who doesn’t.

But the lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said: “Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren’s rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes — even if it means things are harder along the way.”

AD

Seven out of 10 Democrats said they would be excited if Warren became the Democratic nominee for president in 2020. Fewer — 56 percent — said they would feel the same about Biden winning the nomination.

And the excitement is rooted in Warren’s left-of-center ideas — she has released dozens of plans on an array of topics, including universal child care and getting rid of the electoral college. Because of her left-leaning politics, some assumed that Sanders would be most at risk of losing his support to Warren. But this poll suggests that Warren may mostly be taking support from Biden — and that could continue.

AD

Warren is less well known than Biden. Only 9 percent of those surveyed haven’t heard of Biden, who served in Congress for three decades before becoming the vice president to America’s first black president. Nearly 20 percent haven’t heard of Warren.

This means there’s a good chance for an uptick in support for Warren. As more people become aware of who she is, there’s a chance of more people liking what she is saying — and keeping her at the top of the polls.

“Everything is real time,” Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois and a member of the Intelligence Committee. “You don’t sit back and contemplate the future when you are in the middle of it.”

With Congress now in a two-week recess and lawmakers headed back home to their districts, Democrats were working on two tracks, meticulously outlining a rapid-fire set of investigative steps while they honed their messaging for what promises to be a divisive and politically charged process.

House Democratic leaders instructed their rank-and-file on Friday to keep it simple when talking to voters, emphasizing that Mr. Trump had “engaged in serious wrongdoing” and had “abused the office of the president.”

I don’t tally,” she told me during an interview after her appearance at a NARAL Pro-Choice America event on Thursday, when I asked how many ongoing suits Massachusetts currently has against the administration. “We just bring cases we need to bring.” She has filed dozens of cases on everything from “voting to the census to health care to immigration to the environment and . . . on women’s access to health care.”

State attorneys generals have always worked cooperatively in major litigation against private firms, as they are doing against pharmaceutical companies in the opioid crisis — and as they have done against the tobacco companies, lenders after the financial crisis and in all sorts of consumer protection cases. “What happened and what you saw after the 2016 election was the emergence of a group of AG’s,"" she explained. ""It is highly unusual to find ourselves at a time having to take on the federal government, to stand up for the rule of law, protect democracy, protect people’s rights.”

“The courts have been allies in the fight to restrain Trump’s agenda,"" she said. ""The courts have really been the place we’ve gone to toe the line on some of these illegal and unconstitutional actions.” She and the other attorneys general have been quite successful in bringing suits, usually with requests for preliminary injunctions. “It is critically important we had this branch to go to stop abuses by the executive branch,” she said. Multiple iterations of the Muslim travel ban and environmental regulations were stopped by states’ actions in court.

While it is “too soon” to tell the impact of Trump-appointed judges, the rate of confirmations and the spotty qualifications of some remain a long-term concerns. In this context, Healey credits the role of state courts, laws and constitutions that can retain rights and protections when the federal government rolls back.

On health care, Massachusetts and other states have multiple actions pending around the country seeking to preserve the Affordable Care Act and/or stop administration efforts to undermine or whittle away the protections in the law. On a more basic level, she finds the administration’s conduct on health care extraordinary. Healey explains, “The Republicans have tried to take away healthcare how many times? 97 times? 100 times? You saw the American people come forward to say, ‘Don’t take away our healthcare.’ "" Nevertheless, the Trump administration continues court actions to obliterate the ACA and slash Medicaid. “What you see is Democratic AG’s stepping into the fore,” she said. Healey also said she hopes for “more sensible policy making” and an end to efforts to take away what they cannot take away through legislation.

Massachusetts has joined California and other states in seeking to maintain the waivers that California gets (and other states sign onto) to allow higher air-quality standards than the federal government requires. The feds now want that to end, and to reverse progress made in various states with the full cooperation of the auto companies. “It’s stupid policy. It’s stupid economically and it’s really morally reprehensible,” Healey says. She finds the administration’s response — suing the auto companies for cooperatively keeping air-quality standards high — a ridiculous use of resources.

I asked Healey about the scandal enveloping the White House and Justice Department. Healey says she finds it “very troubling, very disturbing and [I] think it should be a significant cause of concern for any American.” She reiterates that the attorney general is the people’s lawyer, not Trump’s personal lawyer and yet, time and again, it has been Trump’s personal interests that have prevailed. Healey says it is “incredibly concerning” that so many lawyers at Justice Department, the White House and elsewhere seem to have been involved or at least have been mute. “And it’s not just within the White House DOJ,” she said. “But look what’s happening in the Congress, too. Any number of those senators are lawyers themselves or have lawyers working for them and yet for them to continue to turn a blind eye to an administration that does not respect the rule of law. . . .”

Healey worries that corrupt conduct gets normalized. “I did it, so what?” seems to be the new defense, she observed. “We need a time out and a reset about what is right and what is wrong.” She fears we have gone “astray” and rather than adhere to our constitutional traditions we are “replicating authoritarian regimes.”

If Warren does win the presidency, it’s quite possible that Healey will occupy a prominent role, or perhaps try to run to replace Warren as senator. I asked Healey whether she thought Republican Gov. Charlie Baker would, in that event, have an obligation to appoint a Democrat on a temporary basis. For the first time during the interview, she replied briskly: “No comment.” For now, she’s a principal legal antagonist of the administration and an enthusiastic Warren supporter. Remember her name, however. I’m quite certain that Massachusetts attorney general will not be the highest office she holds.

Less funny, anonymity also has largely defined Klobuchar’s role in the Democratic presidential contest — even though she has been a senator from Minnesota for 12 years and serves in leadership, even though she passes more legislation each session than most Democrats, even though she’s regularly on cable news and is campaigning across the country.

At the beginning of the latest Democratic debate earlier this month, Klobuchar — who was stationed at the last lectern on the far left of the stage — embraced reality.

“I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we’ve already got that in the White House,” she said, adding, “If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you’ve got a home with me.”

The question for her campaign: In a primary driven by more combative activists, how many voters want that? And why her over other centrist candidates?

Klobuchar has seen a small bump in some polls since that debate, delighting her and her staff. A September Focus on Rural America poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers found her support at 8 percent, and a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll released last weekend put her at 3 percent. Yet an average of national polls in September showed Klobuchar’s support around 1 percent.

AD

AD

She’s leaning on the fact that most voters say their support is fluid. Yet, for months she’s been overshadowed in the center by former vice president Joe Biden, who, like her, contends he’s a champion of working-class Midwestern voters and union members and knows how to work with Republicans to get legislation passed. And she has no clear strategy for changing that.

While most Democratic candidates have publicly challenged Biden — questioning his age and his comments on racial issues, among other things — Klobuchar largely has refrained and has even come to Biden’s defense. When asked why she thinks she would have a better shot at winning Rust Belt states than Biden, who grew up in Pennsylvania, Klobuchar says that she is “actually from the Midwest,” is a woman and is “in a new generation of politicians.” (At 59, she is 17 years younger than Biden.)

“A generation that actually has governed during the Trump era, which I think is key,” she said during a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. “I was able to navigate this Congress during and before Donald Trump.”

AD

AD

Meanwhile, Klobuchar has repeatedly questioned and criticized policy ideas embraced by the two most prominent liberals in the race — Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — that she says are too costly and would be paid for by the already strapped middle class. That includes Medicare-for-all, which Klobuchar calls “a bad idea” that would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance plans, and making four-year colleges tuition free, which she says would force blue-collar workers to foot tuition bills of “rich kids.”

These sorts of ideas “are better left in the college faculty lounge,” Klobuchar said in Detroit last week — which sounded like a jab at Warren, a former law professor, although Klobuchar insisted it wasn’t. Klobuchar has said that although Warren has a plethora of plans, her own plans “have deadlines” and are more likely to be passed and implemented.

Via a small charter plane, Klobuchar recently took a whirlwind two-day trip through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three usually Democratic states that gave Trump the White House. During the trip, she made sure to note that in 2018 she won 42 Minnesota counties that voted for Trump two years earlier, when he came surprisingly close to winning her home state.

Klobuchar said that presidential candidates need to keep voters in these states in mind now — and that a more moderate candidate would have better success there during a general election.

During a visit to a carpentry-training center in Pittsburgh, Klobuchar often finished the sentences of her tour guides as they spoke of the dire need for welders and their frustration that some parents push their kids into four-year colleges when a trade school would be a better fit.

She said the government should double the amount of money given to students through Pell grants, increase the income cap to qualify for those grants and make one- and two-year-degree programs free.

AD

“We are so focused sometimes on one path to success and that’s not everyone’s path to success, and we need to make it easier for students to go to programs like this,” she said.

AD

The next day, she took artisanal doughnuts to United Auto Workers members striking outside a General Motors assembly factory in Detroit.

“I stand with you guys,” she told them. “You stood with the company when it was in trouble, right? Took a bunch of cuts, did things. And now the company is doing better, and you should share in that prosperity.”

Some responded positively.

“She said all the right things — which they do, but she seemed heartfelt and genuine, and you don’t usually get that from politicians,” said Meoshee Edwards, 47, who has worked at the plant for 23 years, likes Sanders and knew nothing about Klobuchar before she showed up. “She seems to know exactly what we’re fighting for and why we’re fighting for it. . . . I am going to research her now.”

AD

But Klobuchar wasn’t warmly embraced everywhere. During a tour of a dairy farm in rural Wisconsin — home to a young calf named “Amy” in her honor — a few of the local farmers who had gathered to meet her were upset that she spent more time talking to the media than to them. Later that day, she stopped by a training session in Milwaukee to share her ideas for expanding voting access with a group of African American activists and take a few questions about her time as a prosecutor. As she took a photograph with the group, one man declined to be included because he said she hadn’t taken enough questions and hadn’t fully answered the questions she was asked.

AD

Throughout the trip, Klobuchar made clear that to her, being a moderate isn’t just about policy — it’s also about her tone and approach. That’s meant focusing on issues and legislation that Republicans are willing to work on, even if it doesn’t excite a lot of Democratic primary voters. It has meant remaining calm and collected while questioning Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. It has meant being the un-snazzy mom on the debate stage who scolds the others when they bicker.

“We need to not just change the policies in our country, but also change the tone of our politics,” Klobuchar said to cheers in a Milwaukee coffee shop last week.

AD

Sitting in the audience was Nancy Glissman, 59, who drove more than two hours with her husband from Illinois to be there. For many years, Glissman voted for Republicans for president but then voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. With Trump in office, she is now firmly a Democrat.

AD

“I think Amy could lead us out of this without being divisive to our country,” said Glissman, who is retired. “We need somebody strong, but somebody that everyone can trust and get around. I think she’s that kind of person.”

Glissman sat with Brenda Dourseau, 60, a retired corrections officer who said the party needs to focus on reconnecting with young voters such as her grandchildren — and she wasn’t sure whether Klobuchar was the person to do that.

AD

“We need a candidate that can really touch these millennials. If they can lead them and get them excited, then [baby boomers] are going to follow, because we know that we have to get Trump out of there,” she said. Democrats “need to go to the younger voters. They truly do.”

Tom Glissman, Nancy’s husband, said that he would give Klobuchar more consideration if she were doing better in the polls. He is leaning toward Warren — although he wishes she would abandon her calls for Medicare-for-all and instead embrace offering a public option, as Klobuchar has done.

AD

“I love Elizabeth Warren, I really do, but she’s just a little too far left,” Dourseau said. “With all of the fire in the belly she has — if she was a little more moderate, she would be a shoo-in.”

All three agreed that they would vote for any Democrat in the general election.

“I can’t wait until this nightmare is over,” Glissman said. “I can’t wait until this Trump presidency is over. I will sleep better.”

“Me, too,” Dourseau said. “It’s a mess. The country is a mess.”"

President Trump. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)

The congressional Republicans fiercely defending President Trump's conduct in a July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart are leaning on a legal technicality.

The president, they say, did nothing wrong by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate one of his chief 2020 rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, because he never framed the request as an explicit quid pro quo in exchange for military aid.

Critics say the argument is extremely tenuous: Any rational person reading the rough transcript of the call would understand Trump made clear Zelensky should open a probe to ensure the release of the $390 million aid package.

Yet Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), describing the threshold for a quid pro quo, suggested the president would have needed to say something like, “‘Uh, hey pal, you know, you need to like, go after the Bidens or I ain’t gonna give you any money.’ He’d be really, like, thuggish about it.”

Some election law experts say Graham has a point: Through a series of decisions over the past two decades, courts have raised the bar almost impossibly high for prosecutors seeking to prove public officials have traded their power for personal gain. The resulting dynamic undergirds Washington’s swamp economy — a system protecting the outsize influence of donors and lobbyists by allowing them to keep goodies flowing to policymakers, while ensuring those in power don’t face scrutiny for horse-trading.

“Quid pro quo being a high legal standard is a fair point,” says Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, “though the words in that phone call come a lot closer to proving quid pro quo than you see in a lot of cases.”

The case that began chipping away at the public corruption standard unfolded in the shadow of the last presidential impeachment. Two weeks before President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House in December 1998, a federal court acquitted his agriculture secretary, Mike Espy, of corruptly taking sports tickets and other lavish gifts from lobbyists for companies he regulated. Prosecutors said Espy accepted $34,000 worth of sports tickets, luggage and other lavish gifts from lobbyists. But the court found Espy hadn’t violated an illegal gratuities statute in doing so, because prosecutors failed to prove he took any official action in exchange.

“Going into that case, people thought this was pretty straightforward,” says the Brookings Institution’s Darrell West. “But what it revealed is that you have to demonstrate you got a benefit and you did something in return … Trump could easily defend himself by saying he just wanted to establish warm relations between the two countries, and he wasn't doing something in return for a campaign benefit.”

West said the Espy verdict had a chilling effect on public corruption cases. And decisions in subsequent cases further eroded the legal standard.

The U.S. Supreme Court has helped turn the tide. A 2010 ruling involving the former Enron executive Jeff Skilling, for example, narrowed the so-called honest-services fraud statute. “The court restricted the use of the provision to only the most egregious forms of fraud, such as bribery and kickbacks, disallowing the charge for grayer types of corporate malfeasance,” Jesse Eisinger writes in the book ""The Chicken**** Club.”

Bookbinder says while the decision was aimed primarily at corporate defendants, it had a spillover effect for public officials facing potential corruption charges, as well.

The high court in 2016 ripped some more pages from the prosecutors’ playbook by unanimously overturning the conviction on public corruption charges of Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell. The Republican had taken more than $175,000 in loans and gifts from a Richmond businessman who wanted state universities to test a dietary supplement his company had developed.

But as The Post’s Robert Barnes wrote at the time, the tests were never conducted and the gifts didn’t violate state law. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts reasoned, “There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that. But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government’s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.”

These laws are written, of course, by people subject to them. “They’re looking to protect themselves, and the laws have been interpreted very narrowly by the courts,” Bookbinder says. “Courts can be very sympathetic to public officials. Judges don't seem to like broad public corruption laws.”

Whether that stems from judicial philosophy or an interest in avoiding antagonizing another branch of government, the upshot has been good for the swamp. In the 20 years since the Espy decision, spending on federal lobbying alone has more than doubled, from $1.45 billion in 1998 to $3.46 billion last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

George Brown, one of the prosecutors in the Espy case who now teaches at the Boston College of Law, says in Trump’s case, “if I was a lawyer in the House, I would say even though I can't point to a statute, that doesn’t mean this is not grounds for impeachment… We don’t have a federal crime of ‘abuse of office.’ But this is an abuse of office.”

And Democrats who have now launched a formal impeachment inquiry don’t need to meet a legal standard to press ahead. The Constitution gives lawmakers wide latitude to determine what constitutes presidential “high crimes and misdemeanors.” And Trump may have broken the law anyway, since it is a crime to solicit a campaign contribution from a foreign citizen, and a foreign corruption probe aimed at a rival arguably constitutes an in-kind donation.

Trump and his defenders nevertheless continue emphasizing the lack of an explicit deal between the president and Zelensky. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted it:

❌ Myth: The President made a “promise” to Zelensky in return for reviving an investigation relating to Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.



✔️ Fact: There was no promise. The President wanted allegations of corruption potentially involving an American official to be investigated. — Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) September 26, 2019

The talking points the White House distributed to congressional Republicans — which they accidentally sent to Democratic offices, as well, before trying to recall them — led with the no-quid-pro-quo argument. And some top Republicans on the Hill are sticking with it:

We have the transcript.



So why did Schiff make up his own version of the call in a Congressional hearing?



Because he knows the transcript shows no quid pro quo or crimes.

MARKET MOVERS

— Jobless claims increase to three-week high: “Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits rose for a second week but remained near historically low levels, a sign the labor market remains broadly robust,” Bloomberg News’s Reade Pickert reports.

“Jobless claims rose 3,000 to a three-week high of 213,000 in the week ended Sept. 21, according to Labor Department figures released … that were about in line with estimates in Bloomberg's survey. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, fell to 212,000, the lowest since late July.”

Consumer confidence is also dropping: “U.S. consumer comfort fell for a third week as views of the buying climate dimmed to the weakest level since June, adding to signs consumer spending will moderate after the strongest quarter since 2014,” Bloomberg’s William Edwards reports. “The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index slipped to 61.7 in the week ended Sept. 22 from 62.7 the prior week, data released Thursday show. The buying gauge eased to 54.3 from 54.5 with views on personal finances and the national economy also posting declines.”

— Business investment drop-off was steeper than we thought. Reuters's Lucia Mutikani: ""U.S. business investment contracted more sharply than previously estimated in the second quarter and corporate profit growth was tepid, casting a shadow on an economy that is being stalked by financial market fears of a recession... The soft investment and sluggish profit gains, reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday, could raise doubts on consumers’ ability to continue driving the economy...

""Business investment declined at a 1.0% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its third reading of second-quarter gross domestic product. That was the steepest decline since the fourth quarter of 2015.""

— Housing gains are underwhelming: “The housing market is a bit better lately. But considering the overall economic environment, the improvement still counts as underwhelming,” the WSJ’s Justin Lahart reports.

“The National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending home sales — sales of previously owned homes that are under contract but haven’t been finalized — bounced back in August, putting it 2.5% above its year-earlier level. That follows … [the] Commerce Department report showing that new-home sales jumped last month and last week’s report that existing-home sales firmed in August.”

Putting the gains in perspective: “Combined new- and existing-home sales have gotten back only to where they were in the beginning of last year. And they are about level with where they were in 2000, when the U.S. population was significantly lower than it is now.”

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— U.S.-China talks set to resume next month: ""Trade talks between the U.S. and China are set to resume Oct. 10-11 in Washington, D.C., three people close to the talks told CNBC,"" CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Kayla Tausche reports. ""Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing the delegation from Beijing, one of the people told CNBC.""

""Liu visited Washington this spring sporting the title 'special envoy,' empowering him to negotiate on behalf of President Xi Jinping and pledge to buy American soybeans in the Oval Office with [Trump]. But Liu was stripped of that title on a subsequent trip, after hardliners within the Communist Party balked at some of the concessions to which he had agreed.""

Meanwhile, China says it is buying agriculture products: China says it has purchased “a ‘considerable’ amount of U.S. soybeans and pork ahead of the next round of trade talks in Washington,” CNBC’s Yun Li reports.

“Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press conference that the U.S. and China are maintaining ‘close communication’ in preparation for the negotiations next month. He confirmed China has resumed its purchase of American farm goods and said the tariffs on those orders will be exempted.”

— Lumber mills slash jobs amid trade war: “The big bet that U.S. hardwood lumber companies placed on China over the past two decades is collapsing,” the Wall Street Journal’s Austen Hufford reports.

“China was a savior of sorts for the industry after the financial crisis last decade. Customers there kept buying oak and ash boards in large quantities, while construction and furniture production fell in the U.S. Now, after Beijing placed retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on imports of lumber and other U.S. wood products, exports of hardwood lumber to China have fallen 40% this year.”

POCKET CHANGE

— Effects of GM strike start to spread: “The United Auto Workers strike at General Motors Co. is starting to take a toll on businesses throughout Michigan, creating a growing threat to the state’s already-slowing economy,” the WSJ’s Kris Maher reports.

“Michigan’s economy faces the greatest exposure from a prolonged strike, because it has about 15 GM manufacturing facilities employing tens of thousands of workers, more than any other state … The work stoppage had cost GM hourly workers and others in Michigan not working due to the strike a total of about $9.3 million a day in lost wages by the end of last week, according to the Anderson Economic Group. For the state, that meant about $400,000 in income-tax revenue a day.”

GM reverses decision on striking workers’ health care: The automaker said “it will pay for the health insurance of its striking hourly workers, reversing a decision to push the costs onto the United Auto Workers union,” Reuters’s Ben Klayman reports. “The UAW had accused GM of blindsiding them with the decision to drop coverage during the strike, and some workers had claimed they could not pay their medical bills as a result. The union seized on this issue to rally public and political support for the 48,000 striking workers.”

— Telsa stock jumps after Musk’s comments: “Shares of Tesla jumped more than 5% after Electrek, an electric vehicle news website, reported that CEO Elon Musk said the company ‘has a shot’ at delivering 100,000 cars this quarter, which would be a new record,” CNBC’s Jasmine Kim reports.

“Electrek attributed the update to a leaked email from Musk sent to his employees at Tesla. Musk wrote in the email: ‘We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter, which is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company!’ ”

— WeWork’s CEO voted to oust himself: “When WeWork’s directors voted on Tuesday to oust Adam Neumann as chief executive after a failed attempt to take the office-sharing startup public, Neumann cast his vote against himself, according to three people familiar with the situation,” Reuters’s Joshua Franklin, Anirban Sen and Koh Gui Qing report.

“The vote by Neumann, who remains non-executive chairman but gave up majority control of the company he co-founded, was the culmination of a stunning coup to remove him led by his biggest backer, Masayoshi Son, the billionaire CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, these sources said.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Senate passes stopgap spending bill: ""The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill ... to keep the government open through Nov. 21, punting tough decisions about [Trump’s] border wall and other funding disputes until just before Thanksgiving,"" my colleague Erica Werner reports.

""The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it.""

What's next: ""The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020. The bipartisan vote on the spending measure came despite a Capitol in chaos over House Democrats’ new impeachment inquiry of Trump and a whistleblower complaint against Trump related to a call he had with the president of Ukraine.""

2020 WATCH:

— Wall Street Democrats warn they'll boycott if Warren wins nod. CNBC's Brian Schwartz: ""Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race.""

The quotes:

A ""senior private equity executive"": ""You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump.’”

An ""executive at one of the nation's largest banks,"" on hedge fund and bank executives: ""They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry.""

A ""hedge fund executive"": ""I think if she can show that the tax code of 2017 was basically nonsense and only helped corporations, Wall Street would not like the public thinking about that.""

Warren responds:

I'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need. https://t.co/nx7GczQhHl — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 26, 2019

Biden, not to be outdone, is weighing a new Wall Street tax, my colleague Jeff Stein scoops: ""The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said... Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals.""

The backdrop: Record-high income inequality. The Post's Taylor Telford: ""Income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it more than five decades ago, according to data released Thursday, even as the nation’s poverty and unemployment rates are at historic lows. The gulf is starkest in wealthy regions along both coasts such as New York, Connecticut, California and Washington, D.C., as well as in areas with widespread poverty, such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Equality was highest in Utah, Alaska and Iowa.

""And while the nation is in the midst of its longest economic expansion, nine states saw spikes in inequality from 2017 to 2018: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia.""

THE REGULATORS

— SEC finalizes rule to encourage IPOs. Reuters's Katanga Johnson: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday finalized a new rule that allows all companies to privately sound out prospective investors before filing for a stock exchange listing. The so-called 'testing-the-waters' rule, which currently only applies to smaller firms preparing to go public, will now be extended to all prospective issuers hoping to gauge broader market interest before filing registration statements for initial public offerings, the SEC said.

""The move, which the agency’s commissioners unanimously voted to approve on Wednesday, is part of a broader push by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to make it easier for companies to go public, amid worries that a 50 percent decline in U.S. listings over the past two decades is hurting investors.""

The context: Big-ticket IPOs have been a big disappointment this year, as the NYT's Matt Phillips, Stephen Grocer and Erin Griffith report: ""This was supposed to be the year when America’s biggest start-ups would finally make their triumphant debut on the stock market. Billionaire Silicon Valley investors, sneaker-clad founders and button-down bankers all expected enormous stock sales to turn companies like Uber, Lyft and WeWork into a new generation of corporate giants.

""It hasn’t quite turned out that way. Last week, WeWork postponed its planned initial public offering. Uber and Lyft sold shares earlier this year only to see their prices collapse. Investors took a look and backed away, seeing overpriced companies with no prospect of making money any time soon, in some cases led by untested executives. On Thursday, Peloton joined the list with a disappointing first day of trading.""

THE FUNNIES

From Mike Luckovich:

BULL SESSION"
268,Abha Bhattarai,"At Overstock.coms 20th-anniversary party last month, employees played tug-of-war, munched on artisan pickles and scrambled through an inflatable obstacle course at the companys headquarters near Salt Lake City. It was a celebratory affair, complete with a reg… [+18822 chars]","Insurers worried the retailer could not rein in Patrick Byrne’s personality and public comments. So, he says, he had no choice but to leave.",2019-09-26,The Washington Post,"Inside Overstock.com, where a firebrand CEO and ‘Deep State’ intrigue took center stage - The Washington Post",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/26/inside-overstockcom-where-firebrand-ceo-deep-state-intrigue-took-center-stage/,"He was about to resign, and not exactly by choice.

The retailer’s chief financial officer had just informed the board of directors that Overstock could not renew its insurance policy as long as Byrne was in charge. The CEO’s incessant broadcasting of his involvement in a “deep state” investigation had irreparably linked his personal life with the public company. On Overstock letterhead the week before, he claimed that he had romanced a Russian agent at the urging of the “Men in Black” — his term for federal agents — and effectively inserted himself into an international political scandal.

AD

AD

Now Overstock’s insurance provider had concerns about the company’s ability to “manage the CEO’s personality and public comments,” according to internal emails obtained by The Washington Post.

In his Aug. 22 resignation letter, dated two days after the anniversary party, Byrne said he’d become ensnared in “certain government matters” and that his “rabbi,” Warren Buffett, had advised him to come clean to the American people. Later that day, Byrne appeared on Fox Business wearing a “Make America Grateful Again” hat and claimed a federal agent had offered him $1 billion to keep quiet.

But he was obligated to come forward because, he told Fox, “This country’s gone nuts.""

AD

Byrne’s resignation capped an unconventional and controversial two-decade run at Overstock.com, a billion-dollar retailer best known for moderately priced home goods. But the company that revolutionized furniture-buying to become one of the biggest successes in e-commerce was now reeling from a series of missteps and diversions, leaving it with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses. The company’s flagship site had become an afterthought for Byrne, 56, who wanted desperately to sell it to focus on his cryptocurrency businesses.

AD

But perhaps the biggest bombshell was Byrne’s claims of entanglement with the FBI. In a corporate news release last month, Byrne said he had been assisting federal agents in their investigation of Russian election interference through his three-year relationship with Maria Butina, the accused Russian agent.

Overstock shares fell 36 percent within days of the news release as anxious investors absorbed Byrne’s accounts of political intrigue, espionage and, in his words, a “handful of trysts” with Butina. The board was losing patience, and its chair, Allison Abraham, had begun forwarding hate mail to him, he said. Abraham did not respond to a request for comment.

AD

Soon Overstock’s insurance carrier was expressing reservations about renewing its liability plan for directors and officers, a scenario that corporate insurance experts say is highly unusual.

AD

“I’ve heard of companies that are too toxic to touch, but for one individual to be a liability risk for the whole company? That’s pretty extraordinary,” said Dan Bailey, an Ohio-based lawyer who has been drafting such policies for more than 30 years. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before.”

Internally, executives explored whether they could get a policy that covered all directors and officers except Byrne. When it became clear they couldn’t, Byrne says, he knew it was time to walk away.

AD

“I figured that when one is having to parse finely what ‘impossible’ means when it comes to getting insurance, it was time to leave,” said Byrne, who spoke to The Post by phone and through more than 80 emails over three weeks.

***

Overstock was designed to keep its shoppers guessing.

The site began as an online flea market where wholesalers could offload just about anything, including exercise machines, bedsheets and Star Wars figurines.

AD

The company got its start in 1999, at the height of the dot-com boom, when Byrne took a $7 million stake in D2: Discounts Direct, an online outlet for excess inventory and relaunched it under the new banner. It grew rapidly: Annual revenue catapulted from $1.8 million in 1999 to $25.5 million in 2000. By 2002, the company saw $92 million in revenue and turned its first quarterly profit.

AD

“In many ways, Overstock revolutionized e-commerce,” said Stormy Simon, who started working for the company in 2001 and was its president from 2013 to 2016. “We were the first to ship couches and huge rugs across the country. There wasn’t a lot of competition — it was just us, Amazon and eBay.""

Many of the company’s early practices have become standard in online shopping. Overstock was a pioneer in “drop shipping,” in which companies cut out the middleman by allowing third-party vendors to ship directly to customers. Meanwhile, its Club O membership program — introduced in 2004, a year before Amazon Prime — allowed shoppers to pay a flat fee for a year’s worth of free shipping. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Post.)

AD

By the mid-2000s, though, new competitors emerged. Overstock moved to improve efficiency and invested heavily in updating its computer systems. But it ended 2005 with $25 million in the red. A year later, losses widened to $97 million.

AD

Its stock also was in free fall, shedding about 80 percent of its value from 2005 to 2007. Byrne attributed that decline to systematic problems on Wall Street, including naked short-selling, in which investors bet against a company’s stock without having borrowed shares. It was all part of a wide-ranging Wall Street scheme, he told investors in a 2005 conference call, that involved “miscreant” hedge funds, high-profile journalists and the SEC. He claimed someone called “the Easter Bunny” had clued him in on the conspiracy, and that it was being overseen by a “Sith Lord,” a reference to a Star Wars villain. (In later interviews, he compared the network of “miscreants” to al-Qaeda.) Although the comments raised eyebrows, the company’s board made no public effort to rein him in.

“I listened to that conference call with my jaw on the floor,” said a former executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal affairs. “But of course nobody pushed back. Everyone was working for Patrick. It was his company, and that was it.”

AD

Byrne became more outspoken over time and sought a bigger platform. He started a website, DeepCapture.com, where he laid out his views and frequently took aim at former colleagues, journalists and hedge fund managers. (In a recent high-profile libel suit, a Canadian judge ordered Byrne and his site to pay nearly $1 million to a Vancouver businessman after DeepCapture accused him of being an arms dealer and terrorist.)

AD

But the campaign also drove his multimillionaire father, John Byrne, to resign from Overstock’s board. The man widely credited with rescuing Geico from bankruptcy in the 1970s said at the time that he disagreed with his son’s “jihad” against Wall Street. (He rejoined the board four years later, saying his son had been “right all along.”)

“It became all about, ‘I’m going to take down Wall Street,' and that became more important than the business,” said Simon, the former president. “Patrick just didn’t love retail after that.""

AD

In 2007, Byrne sued nearly a dozen major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, for $3.5 billion, alleging that a “massive, illegal stock market manipulation scheme” had driven down Overstock’s share price. Several of the banks settled out of court in 2010, for a collective $4.4 million. Merrill Lynch’s case extended into 2016, when it agreed to a $20 million settlement. (He also collected a $5 million settlement from Rocker Partners, a hedge fund he claimed was manipulating the company’s stock.)

AD

“The lawsuits ended successfully,” a spokesman for Overstock said. “And the regulatory changes advocated by Overstock lessened the debilitating consequences of the 2008 financial crisis to some of the largest banks in this county.” That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned “abusive naked short selling.”

Byrne said he personally bankrolled the $30 million for his “mitzvah with Wall Street,” which former employees say began taking priority over the company. “The oligarchy picked a fight; I clubbed them like a little baby seal,” he said in an email. “It was an honor to be able to put that wealth to such good purpose.”

AD

Byrne’s deep distrust of Wall Street lingered. Until a few years ago, the company kept $10 million in gold and silver coins, along with enough food to feed its employees for three months (the stockpile is now down to a few weeks). “Why? To make our firm robust in the face of a number of social ills that could beset our nation,” Byrne said in an email to The Post.

The company also invested heavily in blockchain, the technology behind digital cryptocurrencies. It began accepting bitcoin in 2014, making it the first mainstream retailer to do so, and has continued to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Medici Ventures, its blockchain investment business, and tZero, its trading platform for digital coins. (That part of the business has been the subject of a years-long investigation by the SEC, though executives have said there has been no indication the agency plans to pursue legal action. The SEC declined to comment.)

Byrne has long confounded those around him. He has a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University and a black belt in taekwondo. Much of his world view, he has said, was shaped by three bouts with cancer, starting with a diagnosis of testicular cancer in his early 20s.

Internally, Byrne was known for having grandiose plans and a short attention span, according to interviews with former employees and executives, and one former board member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the company candidly. Byrne relied heavily on an insular group of executives who referred to themselves as “coyotes” and rarely challenged his views, several of them said.

Byrne left his mark on every part of the company: Its newest headquarters was designed to look like a peace sign from above, and like a “corporate version” of the Roman Colosseum from ground level, according to a company release. He also helped create an internal voting system that allowed employees to weigh in on company decisions, such as whether Snoop Dogg should perform at the office or who should be fired.

In recent years, Byrne had been trying to sell Overstock’s retail business, setting up meetings with Walmart, Target, Home Depot and the furniture rental company Aaron’s, according to a person involved in the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were not public. Representatives for the four retailers declined to comment, as did Overstock.

Byrne said he had hoped to sell the retail business in an auction scheduled for March 8, 2018. But days earlier, the company disclosed that the SEC was investigating its blockchain business. Almost immediately, “everybody backed out,” Byrne said, and the company was forced to put its plans on hold. Overstock has yet to find a buyer.

Meanwhile, Byrne doubled down on bitcoin, pouring his ambitions and money into blockchain technology and start-ups — which is what led him to Maria Butina.

***

Their story began at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.

It was 2015, and Byrne had just given a speech about cryptocurrency at FreedomFest, an annual meeting of libertarians that attracted such speakers as Donald Trump, Steve Forbes and Peter Thiel. He said he quickly noticed a “striking redheaded young woman” waiting to speak with him.

Butina introduced herself as the president of a gun rights group in Russia and handed him her business card, Byrne wrote on DeepCapture.com. The next day, she approached him again, with a different card. This one identified her as a special assistant to the vice chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. “Dr. Byrne, please allow me to tell you why I am really here,” she said, according to Byrne. “I have been sent here to make contact with you.""

Butina’s attorney, Robert Driscoll, disputes Byrne’s version of events: “She wasn’t sent to the U.S. by anybody, and she certainly wasn’t sent to the U.S. to make contact with Patrick,” he said, though he confirmed that the two had a romantic relationship.

Byrne invited Butina to his hotel suite for a lunch meeting. Butina told him she was being groomed to become the next president of Russia, Byrne said, and invited him to Moscow to speak about bitcoin at the Russian Central Bank.

Byrne said he then contacted federal authorities and asked whether it would be okay to accept Butina’s invitation to Russia. It took weeks, he said, to get an answer but eventually he received a “green light” telling him to move forward. He had no expectation that their relationship would turn romantic, but Butina “swept me and my liberalism off my feet,” he wrote on Deep Capture. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment.

He said they spent a weekend together in New York, then met up every so often in different parts of the country. It reminded him of “Lost in Translation,” he said, referring to the 2003 film in which an aging actor played by Bill Murray and a recent college graduate played by Scarlett Johansson have a series of intimate meetings.

“We had a handful of trysts like that,” he told The Post in an email, “spread across time, in the background of the normal narrative arc of her life.”

In late 2015, he said, Butina told him she’d been given orders to make contact with the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. (Driscoll disputes this.) Byrne said he reported this to “the Men in Black.”

Two former FBI special agents deemed the claims improbable. It’s unlikely, they said, that a highly trained foreign agent would have revealed her targets — in this case, as Byrne says, the four political campaigns — or that the FBI would have approved a romantic relationship as a means to collect intelligence.

They also dismissed Byrne’s claims that his 2015 phone calls helped spearhead the massive investigation into Russian election interference that culminated in a sprawling, $32 million inquiry by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Byrne said he was never contacted by Mueller’s team.

“There are a lot of steps it seems he’s not aware of,” said John Iannarelli, a retired FBI special agent, who called Byrne’s claims “ridiculous.” “Nothing he has said indicates that he understands how procedures operate.”

When asked why Butina might have revealed her alleged orders, Byrne said she did so while she was “heavily ‘under the influence’” of “large quantities” of serotonin, oxytocin and dopamine — the brain chemicals that spark feelings of love and attraction.

Byrne claims his history with the FBI dates back to 2002, when his friend and former NBA player Bison Dele disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. Byrne wrote on Deep Capture that he had a “minor involvement in helping the authorities sort it out.” (Dele has never been found; authorities believe he and two others were killed by his brother.)

As for Butina, Byrne said that he was under the impression he was receiving orders from top FBI officials. Six months into the relationship, Byrne said, the bureau asked him to break up with her. And he did — by text.

Soon though, Byrne says, the “Men in Black” returned with another request: “They wanted to ask me to rekindle a romantic relationship with Maria Butina,” he wrote on DeepCapture. “Russia was trying to subvert our election, and I was to get to the bottom of Maria Butina. ‘Gloves off.’”

Byrne says he obliged, setting off a chain of events that led to his departure.

***

Byrne is out — but the turmoil at Overstock remains.

On Monday, the company revised down its earnings forecast for the year — in part because of “significantly” higher insurance costs for directors and officers — and announced that its chief financial officer had resigned. Its share price has tumbled about 20 percent this week.

Former employees say Overstock’s retail site has become overly dependent on sweeping discounts and antiquated ideas. They expressed doubts that the new CEO, Jonathan Johnson, a company veteran who most recently led Overstock’s blockchain arm, would be able to steer the business in a new direction.

“I’ve been shoulder-to-shoulder with Patrick for 17 years,” Johnson, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Utah as a Republican in 2016, said in an interview. “If Patrick’s the architect, I’m the builder.”

In practical terms, Johnson says, that means Overstock.com — synonymous for many with bed frames and bath towels — could soon become solely a blockchain company. “If the right fit comes along at the right price, well, we could find another home for retail,” he said.

The company’s e-commerce business has faced mounting competition in recent years, not just from rival websites, but also more traditional retailers like Walmart and Target that are doubling down on home goods and furniture. Overstock’s largest competitor — and the one that seemed to most vex its executives — was Wayfair, a company that regularly posts hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses but has attracted large-scale venture capital funding and has eclipsed Overstock in revenue and market share. Last year, Wayfair posted a loss of $504 million, more than double Overstock’s $218 million loss.

Wayfair’s growing market share, former executives said, was a frequent source of tension within Overstock. And although Byrne’s departure may have helped the e-commerce giant insure its executives in the short term, they say they’re still worried about the company’s long-term prospects.

“You look at it now, and the retail business just isn’t loved anymore,” Simon said. “If you’re not going to feed the baby, you should at least give it up for adoption.”

Byrne is now on an island in Asia, he says, waiting for the whole thing to blow over. He says he has a duty to distance himself — both physically and financially — from the company he started 20 years ago.

He has gold and silver reserves in Switzerland, though he is becoming worried about “the deteriorating world situation.” Last week he sold his entire stake in Overstock — worth $90 million — and is reinvesting some of it in gold, silver and two types of cryptocurrencies, to shield his fortune from “acts of retaliation from the Deep State.”

“That is important because, in fact, I am now going to shellac them,” he wrote on his blog. “Actually, ‘shellac’ is too weak a word for what I intend to do to the Deep State. Sit back and enjoy the show.”"

Look how shady you look trying to duck and weave. Ignore the consultants telling you not to admit you would raise taxes. Put out a plan (you should have your own), and show voters the math. Trust them to see it is a good deal for them, if that is what you believe.

Among the many administration figures reportedly involved in the Ukraine fiasco and the coverup, some were enablers, furthering the scheme by delivering messages or taking overt action (e.g. stopping aid to Ukraine). Others are merely silent bystanders, convinced that if they keep their heads down and let braver colleagues tell the story, they would escape with their reputations and law licenses intact. They cannot, it seems, conceive that this president is collapsing. Whether by the next president, law enforcement or Congress, every detail and crevice of this story will be exposed. In some cases, there will be a fine line between passivity and conspiracy. Advice: Stop. Your tenure in the White House is over. Don’t lose your career, your law license or your liberty on the bet that you can escape notice. Look how quickly the story moves and how many others are already leaking, perhaps in ways designed to deflect blame from them onto you. Resign swiftly, go to the House Intelligence Committee and share what you know. The fear of discovery and of liability that now haunts you will dissipate.

To be certain, the Sean Hannitys and Breitbarts are never going to acknowledge the reality that the president they have boosted and defended is deeply unwell and betrayed his office. They truly are hopeless. But what about members of the pundit class, those who used to be seen as “gatekeepers” for the right, who carried the “But Gorsuch…” or “But taxes…” rationale for supporting the Trump presidency? They think their careers and friendships depend on keeping up with the act of ignoring, deflecting, topic-switching and attacking the messengers (the real media). But at some point, the better-than-average pundit class will find itself in a world in which “respectable” conservatives insist all along that they opposed President Trump. The mob will have moved onto a new hero and figured out that Trump must be repudiated as a crank, an abuser of power and a narcissistic fool in order to rescue the causes of right-wing nativism, elite resentment and bigotry that fund the right-wing ecosphere. Advice: Stop. Read the whistleblower complaint and the transcript, a couple of times if needed. Cease playing dumb about the severity of Trump’s actions. This is a man who threatened the whistleblower with harm. If you really believe in the reasons you supported Trump (tax cuts, judges, a hard line on immigration), understand that those causes will be forever tainted unless they can be divorced from Trump. Blame Trump’s feckless lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani if you like, but urge Senate Republicans to put an end to this debacle with a strong showing that they are willing to impeach.

The hardest thing to do is to give up the perspectives that prevent one from recognizing reality and thereby adjusting to it. Failure to do so has profoundly dangerous consequences.

The evidence of his abuse of government power and his willingness to betray the American democratic process is so obvious that Democrats need not fear they will be framed as “overreaching.”

This new political reality creates all sorts of challenges for Republicans. However, it also introduces a wild card into the Democratic race. I do not mean that this could adversely hurt former vice president Joe Biden. Trump’s wrongdoing is so egregious and Biden’s innocence is so widely accepted that the “flip the script” tactic cannot work in this case. (Indeed, candidates seen to be taking advantage, or suggesting there is something “there"" there, are likely to get bashed.)

Rather, the prospect of a Trump nomination on life support, or even a non-Trump nominee, should force us to reexamine the entire “electability” issue. The premise for the electability question is that Democrats need someone who matches up favorably against Trump. By the time we navigate through impeachment, virtually any of the current candidates (well, maybe not Tulsi Gabbard) could stack up favorably against a president willing to sell out American democracy. The entire definition of “electable” changes if there is no Trump or a badly battered Trump.

For one thing, the obsession that, with Trump, the Republicans have the secret sauce for winning the Upper Midwest will finally die, I would hope. I have made the case that an old white guy to compete against Trump to get other old, cranky white guys in Wisconsin is a ridiculous theory of electability. It makes just as much if not more sense to find a candidate that can excite African Americans, suburbanites and the college-educated. (It is also just as logical to find a candidate with the capacity to win in the Sun Belt.) If Trump literally isn’t there, or if a shadow of the old Trump runs, then Democrats can greatly expand the map and look for candidates who might even win states such as Texas.

Moreover, to the extent candidates have made their campaign about beating Trump, the absence or diminution of Trump poses a real dilemma. Here, Biden does have a challenge. He has told us that the deciding factor for his run was Charlottesville. He is running for the “soul” of the country, to prevent another four years of Trump. Would he have decided to run at all had Trump not been president? Not according to the narrative he is currently using. If he wants to stay in the race without the Trump target, he might need to shift his rationale somewhat. (He can still argue that Trump has made such a mess that the country needs an experienced hand to clean it up.)

On one hand, a diminished or absent Trump might boost Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Hey, we can take a bigger risk with her as the nominee! On the other hand, without a fully-charged Trump, perhaps her prairie populism is not needed, and could simply scare off winnable moderates.

The candidates best positioned for a weakened Trump or a non-Trump nominee likely are those Democrats who have explicitly said that America’s problems did not start with Trump and that the campaign must not be all about Trump. The obvious contender in this category would be South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who says he wants to turn the channel and make the campaign about generational change.

At any rate, Democrats should plan for either eventuality — a run against Trump (even a damaged one) or a run against a more garden-variety Republican. It is way too soon to count Trump out, but it’s not too soon to start planning for the possibility he might not be the nominee.

THE KEY

Now there's proof: The voting machines used in the 2020 contest are still incredibly insecure.

That's the message from ethical hackers visiting the Capitol yesterday.

They tested an array of voting machines and election systems that states plan to use in the next election -- and were able to crack into every machine they got their hands on.

Lawmakers seeking to get more election security funding embraced their findings -- and promised to spread the results of their work to scare every sitting member about the political risks of weak security.

“The best way we can make the case is by scaring the living bejesus out of every member of Congress that the system can be fixed against them,” said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.).

The ethical hackers' tests, which took place this summer at the Def Con cybersecurity conference's ""Voting Village,"" could easily be replicated by voters, poll workers, or anyone else with access to the machines, said Matt Blaze, a co-founder of the election testing project and a Georgetown University cryptography professor. And in some cases, he said, hackers could probably compromise the machines even if they weren’t anywhere near them — especially if poll workers made mistakes setting them up or took shortcuts.

All it took was a few days of tinkering on machines they mostly bought on eBay. “The resources of…eBay are well within that of our foreign adversaries,” Blaze warned.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a major booster for election security funding, said the tests prove “it is basically a piece of cake for a relatively savvy hacker to compromise an election and alter votes.""

But the wide variety of serious flaws these hackers found, ranging from weak default passwords to shoddy encryption, underscores just how little time states have to make fixes by 2020. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is blocking bills that would mandate key election security fixes recommended by Blaze and other security experts in exchange for cash.

“As of today, my view is that hostile foreign powers — and I’m not talking just about the Russians — are going to interfere in the 2020 election in a way that’s going to make what happened in 2016 look like small potatoes,” Wyden said.

Intelligence officials are also warning that Russian hackers who probed voting machines and hacked into voter databases in 2016 could do far worse next time, and other nations may be eager to follow suit. During a hearing yesterday focused on the landmark whistleblower complaint against President Trump, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire warned that cyberattacks and election interference are the “greatest challenge” the intelligence community faces, declaring ""this is cyberwar.""

Blaze and his co-founder Harri Hursti, founding partner of Nordic Innovation Labs, are urging Congress to require states to use paper ballots whenever possible and to conduct post-election security audits.

McConnell recently endorsed delivering an additional $250 million in federal money to state election officials but that's far lower than the $600 million Democrats in the Senate and House are pressing for -- and it doesn't include any mandates about how states must spend the money.

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

President Trump. (Erin Scott/Reuters)

PINGED: The computer system where officials stored the rough transcript of a conversation between President Trump and the leader of Ukraine is considered the White House's most secure lockbox. That's why it's highly unusual that a conversation containing no apparent highly classified information got stored there, several former officials from both the Obama and Trump administrations tell the Wall Street Journal's Warren P. Strobel and Andrew Restuccia. The “code word” computer system described in the whistleblower complaint is typically reserved for documents about U.S. covert actions and counterintelligence probes to root out moles and even most top White House national-security aides don't have access to it, the Journal reports

The high level of security would be extreme for a presidential phone call and suggests that the White House was concerned about political damage rather than national security, former National Security Council advisers told Jason Koebler and Joseph Cox at Motherboard.

“You don't have hundreds of people getting access to presidential calls. They're tightly controlled, so … to take the added step of telling the White House lawyers to put this on that system is beyond bizarre to me,” Kelly Magsamen, who served in the National Security Council for two administrations, told Motherboard. “It suggests they know it was extremely damaging.”

PATCHED: The Navy has appointed a new head cybersecurity official following a damning internal audit that found the branch had been hit with repeated national security-threatening compromises that jeopardized state secrets, Gordon Lubold and Dustin Volz at the Wall Street Journal report. Aaron Weis, a former cybersecurity adviser to the Pentagon, will lead the Navy's efforts to improve its cybersecurity standards and to create a stronger defense against increasingly aggressive Chinese hackers, Gordon and Dustin report.

One key focus for Weis will be tightening cybersecurity standards for defense contractors, a major target of foreign hackers. Navy officials expect to roll out a plan for more changes later this year, the Journal reported. The officials declined to discuss specific breaches with the Journal, but in one instance last year Chinese hackers reportedly managed to access plans for a supersonic missile after targeting a small contractor.

PWNED: An ""unauthorized third party"" breached the personal data of nearly 5 million DoorDash consumers, contractors, and merchants in May, the company revealed in a blog post yesterday.

The breach included the victims' names, addresses and phone numbers and also captured the driver's license numbers for 100,000 contractors. The incident, which comes just a year after DoorDash denied reports of a separate breach, could trigger fines under certain state data breach laws.

The company said it only noticed the “unusual activity"" which invovled a third-party service provider earlier this month and immediately blocked the user. Since then, DoorDash has added additional security protections and brought in an outside expert to assess its systems, the company said.

The breach affected only users who joined DoorDash before April 5, 2018, according to the company. The breach also exposed the last four digits of payment cards for consumers and the last four digits of bank account numbers for contractors and merchants.

New York's attorney general is suing doughnut company Dunkin' Brands for “glazing over” the fact that a 2015 hack compromised the accounts of nearly 20,000 customers, resulting in the theft of tens of thousands of dollars stored on users' store cards, the office said in a press release.

The company also failed to investigate the attacks to determine if additional accounts were compromised, the lawsuit claims. The company's failure to address cybersecurity concerns resulted in a second breach of more than 300,000 customers in 2018, which also compromised users' emails and card value, the suit claims. Dunkin' disclosed the 2018 attack to customers, but didn't reveal that hackers had actually accessed those customer accounts, the lawsuit claims.

“Dunkin’ failed to protect the security of its customers,” said Attorney General Letitia James. “And instead of notifying the tens of thousands impacted by these cybersecurity breaches, Dunkin’ sat idly by, putting customers at risk “ The lawsuit is seeking full restitution for the customers, civil penalties and changes to the company's business practices.

The Investigations

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE: Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before Congress starting at 9 a.m. this morning (in open and closed hearings) about the explosive whistleblower complaint that has triggered a historic impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

The nation's top intelligence official will be grilled about his handling of the complaint concerning Trump's interactions with Ukraine and his asking its president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Democrats are expected to press Maguire to cough up details about why the complaint was withheld until yesterday from lawmakers and instead channeled to the Justice Department, where officials determined there was nothing to see there.

What DOJ did: Steven A. Engel, the head of DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, argued in a memo “that it was lawful for [Maguire] to refuse to turn the whistleblower complaint over to Congress — a stance that the Trump administration began to back off of as Democrats stepped up talk of potentially impeaching the president,” reported the New York Times's Charlie Savage, Michael Schmidt, and Julian Barnes report.

Per senior Justice officials, Maguire "" … made a criminal referral [to DOJ], passing to the department the inspector general’s concern that campaign finance laws might have been violated,” per The Post's Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett.

Last week : "" … the Justice Department decided there was not enough evidence to proceed with a campaign finance investigation. The decision, senior [DOJ] officials said, was made by Brian Benczkowski, who heads the Justice Department’s criminal division. They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision,” per Matt and Devlin.

They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision,” per Matt and Devlin. New line of inquiry: “The intelligence officer who filed a whistleblower complaint about President Trump’s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint,” Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes report.

And: ""The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored,"" report my colleagues Matt, Devlin, Carol D. Leonnig and Shane Harris.

The anti-Corey Lewandowski: Maguire, his peers told Power Up, is expected to be the antithesis of Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager who last week turned in a mocking and brash performance on the Hill.

Despite his “acting” title, it's unlikely the acting DNI head will treat the high-stakes appearance as an audition for an audience of one:

“I can't imagine anyone who cares less about that — if he were acting, nominated, or confirmed, he will be the exact same straightforward guy, providing the answers the best he can,” Michael Leitner, the former head of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center director, told Power Up. “It's just an observation having worked with the guy.”

Democrats are expected to hone in on who exactly instructed Maguire to withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress against the urging of intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who determined the complaint was of “urgent concern.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) accused Maguire of not responding to the complaint in an appropriate or timely manner. But yesterday evening, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees received the complaint in full.

Maguire denied any wrongdoing in a statement released Tuesday:

“In light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,” Maguire said.

“I am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately,” Maguire added. “I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.”

The intelligence community, under attack from a president who has consistently politicized it, will also be watching closely:

“How do you square the talking points distributed from this White House with the reality of what the DNI and the intelligence community has said behind closed doors?,"" a Democratic House source asked Power Up. “Will Maguire note the massive contradiction or protect a president who has pitted the intelligence community against each other?”

“Everyone has seen the talking points from the White House and it's literally lies,” the source added of the talking points the White House accidentally distributed yesterday to Hill Democrats.

“The way Maguire has handled this situation has not endeared him to the people he's working with,” a former intelligence official told us.

Maguire was not Trump's first choice for the position: Trump initially nominated Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) to replace Dan Coats after denying then-deputy director Sue Gordon the job. Trump withdrew Ratcliffe's name, however, after concerns he was too political. Maguire's background mirrors what former peers described as a duty to protect the intelligence community:

“A former Navy SEAL, Maguire retired from the U.S. Navy in 2010 after serving 36 years. He was director of the National Counterterrorism Center before his role in the Trump administration,” CNN's Chandeleis Duster reports.

“… Maguire was viewed as a steady hand by Democrats and Republicans alike when he was named by Mr. Trump in August to be acting director of national intelligence after the president pushed his Senate-confirmed predecessor, Daniel Coats, to step down. The president also pushed out Sue Gordon, a career intelligence official who served as Mr. Coats’s deputy,” the Wall Street Journal's Warren Strobel and Dustin Volz report.

But the extent of the tension between the White House and Maguire over the whistleblower's complaint came to light yesterday: our colleagues Greg Miller, Shane Harris and Karoun Demirjian report that the acting director “threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.”

“The officials said that [Maguire], who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday.”

Maguire and the White House denied the story. However, “other officials said that Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it was going to assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July.”

Bottom line — or not: “How this surfaced and how it is now in the public is really a sideshow,” a source who worked with Maguire previously said. “This is about the president and the constitution now.”

At The White House

NOTABLE DEVELOPMENT: The whistleblower's ""identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint, the people said — adding that the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,"" the Times's Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes first reported.

The whistle-blower ""heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had 'abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,'"" according to a Justice Department memo ""which referred only to a single phone call between Mr. Trump and an unnamed foreign leader.""

On The Hill

🚨 218 MEMBERS: A majority of the House now supports opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to our colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips and Kevin Schaul's definitive list.

217 of the 235 House Democrats support an opening an inquiry along with one independent (Rep. Justin Amash, who was formerly a Republican). Watch this: 25 of those members would go as far as voting today to impeach Trump. Remember, it takes a simple majority (218) to vote on articles and formally impeach the president but we are still a ways out from that step, if it does occur. The Senate would then have to vote to convict the president in order to oust him and we're still a ways from that, too.

RED WALL?: “Several Senate Republicans were privately stunned,” our colleague Bob Costa reports, as they “questioned the White House’s judgment after it released a rough transcript of [Trump’s] call with the Ukraine president that showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate [Biden].”

Not a good idea: “Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions with The Washington Post that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats,” our colleague writes.

Most Republicans, for now, however are not publicly questioning Trump's actions. But Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) publicly vented their frustrations.

“It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Romney said about the transcript.

Sasse speaks: “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no 'there' there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sasse told reporters after reviewing the complaint. “ … Democrats ought not be using words like ‘impeach’ before they knew anything about the actual substance.”

The Nebraska senator is an interesting case: He is up for reelection next year and faces a primary challenger. But after making waves early in Trump's presidency, Sasse was endorsed by Trump just last week.

Cory Gardner (Colo.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Susan Collins (Maine) are the GOP's most vulnerable incumbents next November, making them among the group of Republicans to watch for potential breaks with the White House. So far though, they and their colleagues are nowhere near that point.

WHY UBER MAY NOT PRIORITIZE YOUR SAFETY FIRST: Investigators say Uber has a three-strike policy for drivers facing complaints, but that executives have overruled their own employees to keep high-performing drivers on the road. In some instances, that has meant overlooking allegations of sexual misconduct. Even when a driver is banned from the app, Uber does not report the behavior to police, its competitors or background check firms, our colleague Greg Bensinger reports in a bombshell story.

A former investigator says what it's really like: “Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Our job is to keep the tone of our conversations with customers and drivers so that Uber is not held liable.”

“Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Uber disputes its policies put the company first, but the story contains a number troubling episodes. ""For instance, a New York-area driver allegedly made three separate sexual advances on riders, said an investigator assigned to the case. After an executive overruled the investigator, the driver was allowed to continue working until a fourth incident, when a rider claimed he raped her,"" our colleague writes. Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police.

Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police. Lyft, in case you were wondering, has faced similar allegations: ""Interviews with Lyft employees indicate that the company also seeks to limit its liability for driver and passenger behavior, in part by deactivating drivers or riders. Earlier this month, 14 women filed suit against Lyft saying they had been sexually assaulted by drivers over the past two years,"" our colleague writes. A spokesman for Lyft said safety is ""fundamental"" to and that it works closely with regulators.

Here's why this matters: ""Many companies go to great lengths to limit their liability,"" our colleague writes. ""But gig economy companies fall in a new category where the question of their liability is still up in the air. There is a different standard of accountability than for the taxi industry, where cab companies generally maintain direct control over the condition and quality of rides and can therefore bear full responsibility for what happens during a fare, according to fleet managers.""

He has pledged to include ultra-Orthodox Jewish factions, and that probably will deter potential secular partners,"" our colleagues Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report. ""He also has endorsed sharing power with Blue and White, but Gantz promised during the campaign never to join forces with Likud unless Netanyahu stepped down.""

A California lawmaker wants to hold ride-hailing companies accountable after a Washington Post investigation exposed that Uber went to great lengths to avoid liability for passengers' reports of sexual assault and harassment.

Lorena Gonzalez, a Democratic state assemblywoman representing San Diego, tells me in an interview that she’s now drafting legislation that would ensure Uber and Lyft properly investigate claims of sexual assault and harassment.

Gonzalez is considering mandatory reporting requirements for allegations of sexual assault after my colleague Greg Bensinger found Uber's internal investigators are forbidden to share them with law enforcement or other ride-hailing companies.

If a customer reports a crime, Gonzalez told me, it must be properly investigated. “There does need to be a responsibility to truly investigate,” Gonzalez told me. “That's clearly not happening.”

Gonzalez's plan to introduce legislation, likely in December, is just the latest sign that lawmakers are growing fed up with technology companies' excuse that they're just digital platforms -- and not responsible for the real-world problems that arise when people abuse their services.

Uber and Lyft have perfected this defense: They frequently argue that they don't employ the drivers -- but serve simply as the tech provider that connects them with rides -- so they can't be held accountable for their actions.

But Gonzalez says that if the companies want to take credit for creating a new way for consumers to travel, they also have to take the blame if people's safety is at risk.

“They're trying to have it both ways,” she said. “They're trying to suggest that they're creating this safe easy way for people to get around, but they want no liability when it comes to anything, whether it's work or pay or the dangers they're putting workers in or the dangers they're putting customers in.” Gonzalez is also considering requiring background checks of drivers to include finger prints.

Uber announced this morning it was rolling out a suite of new safety features amid the increased public scrutiny, including a new feature in its app which would allow customers to report uncomfortable situations like erratic driving and invasive questioning, my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports.

“The core principle for us here is, underreporting is a big issue in every industry and we want to be able to help with that,” Sachin Kansal, Uber’s head of safety products, said in an interview. “If a user has a bad experience, we want to hear about that.”

Though Greg's investigation primarily focused on Uber customers who reported sexual assault and harassment at the hands of their drivers, Gonzalez says she's also talked to drivers who have experienced sexual harassment while working for the companies. Any legislation she introduces will include protections for both drivers and customers.

Uber told Greg that it doesn't report its findings with background check firms, law enforcement, or other ride-sharing businesses because it wants to be “survivor-centric.” One executive told Greg that a survivor should be able to decide if they want to report their story to law enforcement.

“At the end of the day, we’re not the judge and jury to determine whether a crime has occurred,” Tracey Breeden, Uber’s global head of women’s safety, told Greg. “We’re here to gather information, make a business decision. We’re not law enforcement.”

Gonzalez, who has been leading the charge in California to require gig economy companies to make drivers their employees, says that change would give Uber and Lyft far greater liability for crimes that occur during rides. A bill she introduced requiring companies to reclassify workers essential to their business as employees — known as AB5 — was signed into law earlier this month.

However, Uber and Lyft are planning to fight the law. Uber has said it will not automatically reclassify its drivers as employees when the law takes effect next year because they are not essential to its business.

Given this broader dispute, Gonzalez says that California needs an additional law on the books specifically addressing sexual harassment and assault at ride-hailing companies to ensure riders and drivers are protected.

The concerns about the companies' handling of sexual harassment have also extended to Washington, where Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) is stepping up his oversight of the companies. He sent letters to both Uber and Lyft yesterday requesting information about their driver review policies. Blumenthal specifically said he was concerned about sexual harassment and assault, Greg reports.

Blumenthal told Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that he was “alarmed by Uber’s public statements about this issue, which indicate a brazenly careless attitude about your responsibility to your customers.”

President of the Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky at United Nations Headquarters (JUSTIN LANE/EPA-EFE/REX)

BITS: The release of the rough transcript of President Trump's call with his Ukranian counterpart has revived a conspiracy theory focused on the California cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which exposed Russian breaches of the Democratic Party's computers in 2016, my colleagues Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima write.

Right-wing corners of the Internet celebrated Trump's mention of the company in the July call. “CROWDSTRIKE IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS,” said one message on the Reddit's “the_donald,” a pro-Trump message board. In another Reddit thread, a person wrote, “Trump just put ‘Ukrainian CrowdStrike’ into the consciousness and conversation of every normie that is following this story.”

The vilification of Crowdstrike reflects how misinformation evolves in a complex media environment, ""mixing fact with innuendo before ultimately reaching the president — owner of the world’s loudest megaphone,"" my colleagues write.

“This is insane,” Robert Johnston, CEO of Adlumin and a former CrowdStrike investigator who worked on the probe into the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, told my colleagues. “This is absolute babbling to the president of Ukraine. It’s hard to finger exactly which conspiracy theory he’s subscribing to. But none of them have any grounding in reality.”

Trump has come to think the DNC server hacked by Russian intelligence agents in 2016 may have been hidden in Ukraine, people familiar with the president’s thinking told my colleagues. It isn't the first time Trump has embraced a conspiracy theory, but it wasn’t immediately clear how he reached that conclusion about the DNC server or how that would even have been physically possible, my colleagues note.

NIBBLES: The Justice Department plans to launch its own antitrust investigation into Facebook’s business practices, David McLaughlin at Bloomberg News reports. The new investigation will run parallel to one already launched by the Federal Trade Commission, signaling a growing turf war between the two agencies tasked with overseeing antitrust law in the United States.

Originally the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide antitrust investigations, with the Justice Department taking Apple and Google and the FTC looking into Amazon and Facebook. But Attorney General William P. Barr pushed to retain some oversight of Facebook and may make a similar play for Amazon, David reports.

While sources say the Justice Department will focus on different aspects of Facebook’s business from the FTC, the power grab hasn’t been well received. FTC Chairman Joe Simons wrote a letter to the Justice Department about the issues, sources tell David. Simons acknowledged potential disagreements between the two agencies in a Senate hearing last week. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

BYTES: Amazon is adding Alexa to everything from a ring to glasses, my colleagues Heather Kelly and Jay Greene report. The new devices will test whether customers are ready to trust Amazon with their privacy.

Amazon senior vice president for devices Dave Limp spent the first 10 minutes of his presentation at Amazon's fall product event describing the company's privacy features — signaling how the issue is increasingly top of mind for tech companies.

Amazon will now allow users to delete recordings on a rolling basis in addition to a recently introduced tool that allows users to activate deletion through voice commands. Users will also be able to ask Alexa what the device heard and why it took specific actions, Heather and Jay report.

Amazon has also improved the accuracy of detecting when users say “Alexa” to wake the device to hear commands by 50 percent, reducing the number of recordings captured by Alexa, Limp said.

Users will have to opt in for the new privacy feature, however, which has drawn some criticism.

My colleague Geoffrey Fowler said:

Amazon still doesn’t get it on privacy.



Alexa ‘auto-delete’ is not what we need to protect our privacy.



We need Alexa to not store our voices, our thermostat readings, our every on/off with smart lightbulbs IN THE FIRST PLACE.https://t.co/vDDOMOSako

Amazon's continued push into products for children could also raise alarm among privacy advocates. The company announced it would introduce a messaging app for kids, my colleagues report. Consumer groups accused Amazon of violating federal privacy protections for children by collecting voice recordings on the Echo Dot Kids Edition earlier this year.

The changes follow a number of privacy gaffes for the company, including a Bloomberg News report earlier that year that Amazon gave contractors access to the Alexa recordings — some of which held personal information — without users' knowledge. Amazon also retains transcripts of Alexa requests after audio files are deleted, the company admitted to Congress in July.

RANT AND RAVE

Twitter greeted the announcement of Amazon's new Echo Loop, an Alexa-enabled ring, with a mix of confusion and curiosity.

CNET's Bridget Carey:

-- The Federal Trade Commission is suing one of the nation’s biggest online dating sites for playing with the heartstrings — and purse strings — of users. The FTC sued Match.com, whose parent company also owns Tinder and OkCupid, for allegedly duping users into upgrading to paid subscriptions to access messages from matches that the company knew were from scammers.

Between June 2016 to May 2018, Match.com reported that nearly half a million customers subscribed to its paid services after receiving an advertisement touting a match with a fraudulent profile, which make up as much as 30 percent of its users, the FTC claims. The FTC is also alleging the company used deceptive marketing practices by promising users a free six-month subscription and by not disclosing all the requirements for redeeming the subscription.

“Online dating services obviously shouldn’t be using romance scammers as a way to fatten their bottom line,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.

Match Group said on its website that the lawsuit is based on “completely meritless allegations supported by consciously misleading figures.” The company reports that it catches and neutralizes 96 percent of improper accounts within a day. The FTC initially offered to resolve its claims with a consent order mandating certain changes in the company's business practices, as well as a payment in the amount of $60 million, but no resolution was reached.

-- Today a coalition of 39 organizations and individuals sent an open letter to Congress encouraging lawmakers to create “appropriate safeguards” for police use of facial recognition technology instead of banning its use.

“Facial recognition technology performs significantly better than people tasked with the same responsibilities,” Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Vice President Daniel Castro said in a statement. “Bans on facial recognition technology put improvements in community safety in a standstill, blocking advancements that would improve both public security and law enforcement oversight.”

In addition to ITIF, other signatories included the National Police Foundation and the tech lobbying group Computing Technology Industry Association.

The whistleblower who sounded an alarm while others bit their tongues showed that. So did the inspector general who alerted Congress to his complaint when President Trump’s loyalists were trying to keep it secret. And the public got a glimpse during a House committee hearing on Thursday of how differently this scandal might have played out if Trump's previous pick to lead the nation’s intelligence community had been confirmed.

The temperamental contrast was stark between Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), the hyper-partisan congressman who wanted the job, and Joe Maguire, the decorated military hero who got it instead and seemed eager to show he’s no one’s toady. Democrats faulted Maguire, as the acting director of national intelligence, for checking in with the very entities who a CIA whistleblower had accused of wrongdoing, including Bill Barr’s Justice Department and Trump’s White House counsel’s office, to see if they wanted to claim executive privilege to prevent the disclosure of his allegations.

Maguire noted earnestly that he was new in the role and wanted to do the right thing. The retired admiral had been running the National Counterterrorism Center after 36 years in the Navy, including as commander of Seal Team 6. He said he’s sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution 11 times. “No one can take an individual’s integrity away,” Maguire explained. “It can only be given away.”

Ratcliffe’s questioning of Maguire – which was more of a monologue, really – offered a window into how he might have handled both the complaint and the hearing if he’d found himself in the hot seat. The congressman made the case that Trump prodding his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was “lawful conduct.” He claimed without evidence that the whistleblower was “wrong in numerous respects” and dubiously compared the complaint to the “Steele dossier” in the Russia investigation. “The United States is allowed to solicit help from a foreign government in an ongoing criminal investigation, which is exactly what President Trump did in that conversation,” Ratcliffe declared.

Ratcliffe’s hopes of getting formally nominated went down in flames on Aug. 2 after Senate Republicans expressed concern about his qualifications and evidence that he had padded his résumé. The three-term congressman had impressed Trump in July with his hostile questioning of former special counsel Bob Mueller. When the president pulled his support just a week after announcing his intention to nominate Ratcliffe, reporters asked Trump why he put someone with such limited national security experience up for such an important job without fully vetting him. “I think he would’ve picked it up very quickly,” Trump replied. “I give out a name to the press and they vet for me. We save a lot of money that way.” Trump gave the job instead to Maguire, who had no idea he’d immediately be thrust into the center of an epic fight between the White House and Congress.

During the hearing, Ratcliffe also falsely insisted that the legal opinion from the Justice Department, which claimed that intelligence community officials didn’t need to turn over the whistleblower complaint because it was outside of their jurisdiction, was written by nonpolitical lawyers. “That's an opinion from the Department of Justice ethics lawyers – not political appointees, but career officials that serve Republicans and Democrats,” Ratcliffe said during the hearing.

In fact, that opinion – released publicly on Wednesday – was authored by Trump appointee Steven Engel. Engel earned a reputation as a highly partisan figure in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, which is why Democrats fought his confirmation to run the Office of Legal Counsel. He was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 47 in November 2017. As a former U.S. attorney, it seems inconceivable that Ratcliffe would not know the Office of Legal Counsel is led by a political appointee.

-- It’s also very revealing to contrast how Maguire and Trump talked about the whistleblower. The acting DNI testified that he does not know who wrote the document, but he said he doesn’t question the person’s motives. He added that he believes they “acted in good faith” and insisted that he is glad the information has finally come out. “I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” Maguire said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

As Maguire was testifying, Trump declared that the whistleblower acted like “a spy” and suggested that the legally protected conduct was akin to “treason.” Speaking in New York at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, the president made clear that he’d also like to ferret out anyone else who provided evidence of his misconduct. “I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistleblower … the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

The Los Angeles Times published an audio recording of the closed-door speech, and The Post later obtained a video. “We’re at war,” Trump said in his ad-libbed remarks, referring to the scandal. “These people are sick. They’re sick. And nobody’s called it out like I do.”

-- Trump and his band of brothers have been leaning on the language of war this week. Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, congratulated Democrats at the Maguire hearing on the “rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.”

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House strategist, compared Nancy Pelosi’s speech on Tuesday night to the start of the Civil War in 1861. “Pelosi’s announcement to begin a formal process at 5 p.m. was the shot at Fort Sumter,” Bannon said. “Now you cannot freelance, you cannot go rogue. You have to be disciplined. You have to be high and tight.”

-- Former DNI James Clapper likened the president’s comments about the whistleblower to “witness retaliation.” “What’s really bad about it is this is going to have a very chilling effect on any other potential whistleblowers,” the Trump critic said on CNN.

WHAT’S EMERGED ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER:

-- “The whistleblower’s identity remains obscured, the details of his work for the CIA cloaked in secrecy. But the document he delivered reveals almost as much about the investigative mission he carried out in stealth as it does about the alleged abuses of power by the president,” Greg Miller reports. “[T]he CIA officer behind the whistleblower report moved swiftly behind the scenes to assemble material from at least a half-dozen highly placed — and equally dismayed — U.S. officials. He wove their accounts with other painstakingly gathered material on everything from the intervention of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage. …

“Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what [Mueller] accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment. ‘In the course of my official duties,’ the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that ‘the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.’”

-- The White House learned that a CIA officer had lodged allegations about Trump’s call even as the officer’s whistleblower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, the New York Times reports: “The officer first shared information about potential abuse of power and a White House cover-up with the C.I.A.’s top lawyer through an anonymous process … The lawyer shared the officer’s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. … But as White House, C.I.A. and Justice Department officials were examining the accusations, the C.I.A. officer who had lodged them anonymously grew concerned after learning that [CIA general counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood] had contacted the White House … While it is not clear how the officer became aware that Ms. Elwood had shared the information, he concluded that the C.I.A. was not taking his allegations seriously.”

“The whistle-blower was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity, and has since returned to the C.I.A.,” per Julian Barnes, Michael Schmidt, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner in the Times. “His complaint suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.”

-- The AP also reports that White House and the Justice Department learned about a CIA officer’s concerns about Trump “around the same time the individual filed a whistleblower complaint.” Eric Tucker, Michael Balsamo and Zeke Miller say that information about the whistleblower was already making its way through the administration:

“On Aug. 14, White House counsel John Eisenberg and a CIA official alerted the head of DOJ’s national security division about the original complaint to the CIA. John Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call. He then alerted people within the Justice Department, but it was unclear specifically who he told. In the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community’s inspector general about a whistleblower complaint.”

-- Responding to reader criticism, Times executive editor Dean Baquet defended their decision to publish information about the whistleblower and noted that the White House already knew he was a CIA officer. “We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower — including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House — because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible,” Baquet wrote. “The role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the U.S. abused power and whether the W.H. covered it up.”

-- The whistleblower emphasized in the complaint that he was not the only one worried. “The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,” he wrote in his complaint. “They told me there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

-- If you haven’t yet, take the time read the unclassified version of the complaint for yourself. (It’s posted here.)

NEW DETAILS ON WHAT RUDY WAS UP TO:

-- Giuliani spent months cultivating relationships with five current and former prosecutors in Ukraine to achieve a particular goal: Helping Trump win next year’s election by pursuing allegations damaging to his Democratic rivals. Paul Sonne, Michael Birnbaum, Rosalind S. Helderman and Josh Dawsey report: “Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family. ... During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election. … Some of the Ukrainians Giuliani and his associates interacted with were banned from entering the United States. Giuliani blamed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for blocking the officials from coming to the United States to give him more information. … A former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers — and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.”

-- A former top Ukraine prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of Giuliani’s dirt-digging effort, said Hunter Biden “did not violate anything.” Michael Birnbaum, David L. Stern and Natalie Gryvnyak report: “‘From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,’ former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of [the whistleblower's complaint] … ‘Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,’ Lutsenko said. Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year. Lutsenko said that Giuliani tried to arrange a meeting with him two times before they finally managed to connect on the third try in January, ‘I took a vacation. I took my youngest son, I showed him New York and I met with Mr. Giuliani,’ Lutsenko said. ‘I had a long conversation with him. But this was only in the forum of exchanging information.’

""Lutsenko met with Giuliani again in Warsaw in mid-February, then for a third and final time ‘in Europe,’ he said, refusing to be more specific. Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws. But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.”

-- One of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's political rivals in Kiev is demanding that he release the government's transcript of the call, as Zelensky finds himself in hot water across Europe for his criticisms of the French and Germans. Siobhán O’Grady and Rick Noack report: “In a Facebook post, [Ukrainian opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko] called it ‘strange that the [Ukrainian] President’s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House.’ … [In the call, Zelensky] praised Trump and went on to say he met both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron and told them: ‘They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.’ Those comments were not well received in Europe. ‘To say that I consider this to be incomprehensible would perhaps be a mild way to put it,’ [said] Elmar Brok, who was recently appointed special adviser on Ukraine for outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.”

-- Conservative columnist John Solomon, executive vice president of the Hill newspaper, helped craft the flawed Ukraine narrative that would later be echoed by Trump, his son Don Jr., and Giuliani. Paul Farhi reports: “Back in March, the Hill newspaper published a series of stories and interviews that seemed, at the time, to be mainly of interest to foreign-policy wonks. [Solomon] interviewed Ukraine’s then-top prosecutor, [Lutsenko], who alleged a startling conspiracy: that law enforcement officials within his country had leaked damaging information in 2016 against Paul Manafort ... to help ... Clinton’s presidential campaign. … The story touched off a brushfire within the conservative media, in which Solomon is a prominent figure, but stayed largely out of mainstream view. On Thursday, however, Solomon’s work gained new attention — and raised new questions about its sourcing, credibility and motivation. In [the whistleblower's complaint], Solomon’s stories were cited as part of a narrative about the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine’s government into digging up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rivals.”

-- Trump appears to be counting on confusion over the complex Ukraine story to offer a fog of false claims and allegations to make it appear Joe Biden did something wrong. The Post’s Fact Checker team published a short guide this morning to Trump’s statements — and the truth.

-- And Philip Bump created a helpful timeline of the significant dates in the whistleblower’s complaint to provide more clarity on how Trump's and Giuliani’s efforts to get dirt on Biden unfolded.

CASCADING FALLOUT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE:

-- Vice President Pence is trying to dodge the impeachment spotlight, but his Ukraine moves are attracting notice. Toluse Olorunnipa and Ashley Parker report: “Pence did not participate in [the July call] … But Pence’s name has emerged in several other contexts … The whistleblower complaint … said Pence canceled a planned trip to Ukraine at the direction of Trump, who was seeking to pressure the Ukrainians to help him politically. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed that Pence’s attendance had been requested at Zelensky’s inauguration and that his office had looked at dates for a visit to Kiev. … The vice president’s Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky, and his discussions with Trump, will be key targets for House Democrats … Pence told reporters after the meeting that he had not discussed Biden with Zelensky but said that he had relayed Trump’s ‘great concerns about issues of corruption.’”

-- “The White House has taken extraordinary steps over the past two years to block details of Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders from becoming public. Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report: “The number of aides allowed to listen on secure ‘drop’ lines was slashed. The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call’s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with ‘EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.’ And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak … At one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials. …

“The complaint said the transcript was ‘loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive level.’ According to the whistleblower, ‘one White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.’ … The July 25 call had roughly 12 to 13 people listening in. … Once the call concluded and copies were distributed to top officials in the White House, lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office then directed that the document be moved to a code-word-protected secure computer network that is normally reserved for transcripts that contain national security secrets after officials raised concerns about Trump’s comments, according to the complaint.”

-- Lost in the controversy over Trump’s phone call is Zelensky's effort to curry favor with the president through his private business. Jonathan O’Connell and David Fahrenthold report: “‘Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,’ Zelensky told Trump [according to the transcript of their July 25 call] ... Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him abut it. … It remains unclear whether the stays were illegal. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.""

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced impeachment investigation that could lead to a vote around Thanksgiving. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as [Pelosi] is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-line’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’ Inside the room, the group urged the leadership to keep the messaging around impeachment on national security and the Ukraine probe being led by the House Intelligence Committee…

“Some senior Democrats are even arguing that other committees should forgo potentially explosive hearings that could distract from the intelligence panel’s work … ‘Very few hearings, if any,’ said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. … But many of the moderate freshmen do not want to be seen as rushing to conclusions — whether on the Ukraine probe or any other aspect of potential presidential wrongdoing. … A senior Democratic aide familiar with discussions among the party’s moderate wing relayed concerns that a probe seen as moving too rapidly by the public could backfire. …

“One of the first credible polls to test the Democratic impeachment push following Pelosi’s Tuesday announcement found the public almost evenly split. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist Poll conducted Wednesday found Americans approving 49 percent to 46 percent of the House inquiry, with independents disapproving 50 percent to 44 percent.""

-- Pelosi explained to the New Yorker that impeaching Trump for “bad behavior” isn’t worth it. The difference now is the president, she contends, is undermining democracy and the electoral system. David Remnick writes up his interview: “When I asked Pelosi if she thought Trump knows, in this instance or any other, the difference between right and wrong, she replied, ‘He knows the difference between right and wrong, but I don’t know that he really cares. I do think his categorical imperative is what’s good is what is right for him. In the campaign, he told us who he was. He said that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care, that his supporters wouldn’t care. Well, he could violate our Constitution, the integrity of our elections, and dishonor his oath of office, as he did in this call, and think that nobody cares.’”

-- She’s back: Hillary Clinton is doing a media tour to express support for impeachment, starting with CBS and continuing with additional TV sit-downs next week. The former secretary of state called the man who beat her in 2016 a “corrupt human tornado” and an “illegitimate president.” HRC’s appearances probably aren’t helpful to the Democratic cause and make it look like they’re trying to relitigate the 2016 campaign.

-- Trump is writing the Republican playbook on impeachment, and he’s going with a scorched-earth strategy. Will it work? Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report: “Trump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid. And in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump’s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it. … Trump’s advisers said they envision a ‘split screen’ strategy in the coming weeks. The president is considering stepping up his fall schedule of campaign rallies at arenas across the country to galvanize his supporters outside of Washington and portray House Democrats as liberal insiders who are focused on impeachment instead of governing.”

-- Politico co-founder John Harris, who covered Bill Clinton’s impeachment for The Post, remembers that impeachment proceedings used to be news of unquestionable gravity: “The week showed it's just more fodder for the ideological and culture wars.”

THE (FEW) REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS:

-- Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker endorsed an impeachment inquiry of Trump, joining fellow Republican governor Phil Scott of Vermont. ""It’s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it,” Baker told reporters in the Bay State. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s office did not respond to requests for comment, per Reis Thebault.

-- Former Republican senator Jeff Flake said “at least 35” GOP senators would privately vote for Trump’s impeachment. The Arizonan, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, was responding to veteran Republican political consultant Mike Murphy's suggestion on MSNBC that 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump if it was “a secret vote.” “That’s not true,” Flake said in Texas. “There would be at least 35.” (Fox News)

-- The president's leading advisers are concerned about the ""threat"" posed by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and are ""trying to isolate him,"" Jonathan Martin reports in the Times: ""Mr. Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. … To Mr. Romney, who represents a state where he is beloved and is unlikely to seek another office, it is a moment where he believes country should trump party. ‘Each person should search their own heart and do what they think is right, which is just what I do,’ he said. … Mr. Romney said he was not attempting to steer a party he believes is overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s grip. But as Mr. Romney contemplates what he acknowledges will likely be his last period of public service, his friends say he is appalled by what he sees as the president’s win-at-all-costs immorality and his party’s willingness to remain quiet in the face of such misconduct.”

-- “Because Trump tests boundaries of morality and legality, his defenders are, in effect, calling on Americans to ratify those changes,” writes Michael Gerson, who served as chief speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House. “By all the evidence, Trump believes that politics, stripped of pretense, is the dirty, unethical pursuit of power, which is properly used to destroy your enemies. Republicans who defend or excuse him are providing permission for his radical redesign of public life. This is perhaps the saddest result of Trump’s corruption: turning good men and women into the bodyguards of a petty, cruel, lawless, would-be autocrat. Because Trump has chosen to be transparently corrupt, congressional Republicans cannot dispute the facts of the case (as they did during [Mueller’s] investigation). They may still insist: No quid pro quo. But this is more of a rally chant than an argument.”

Gerson, a Trump critic, believes impeachment has become inevitable: “Impeachment may be inadvisable. It may apply a cheese grater to the nation’s partisan wounds. The process may be conducted foolishly. It may feed a Republican thirst for revenge against a future Democratic president. It may motivate Trump’s base to salivating enthusiasm. The broad, American middle may yawn and switch to ESPN. All of this matters, especially if it increases the chances of Trump’s reelection. But it matters like a fate, not like a choice.”

A RANGE OF VOICES FROM THE POST'S OPINION PAGE:

-- The whistleblower complaint strengthens the case that Trump offered Ukraine’s president a quid pro quo, inveighs the Editorial Board.

-- We sent aid to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's ongoing occupation. By holding back American support, Trump helped Putin, writes Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Obama administration.

-- Trump’s impeachment need not be a long, drawn-out affair, writes liberal Eugene Robinson: “The nation has suffered this small, foolish, dangerous man long enough. Pelosi should damn the torpedoes and move full speed ahead.”

-- The whistleblower complaint doesn’t do the Democrats any favors, argues conservative Henry Olsen: “It offers little new information not already in the public domain. Furthermore, if it continues to be relied upon as evidence justifying impeachment, Democrats will have to make some hard choices about how to proceed.”

-- Democrats are sprinting ahead of the evidence, adds conservative Marc Thiessen, another former Bush speechwriter.

­-- The whistleblower and the vulnerable Democratic freshmen who backed an impeachment inquiry are profiles in courage, writes conservative Max Boot: “This week reminds us that there are some people in Washington who are not motivated solely by self-interest — that there are actually a few people in positions of public responsibility who care about the Constitution and are willing to run considerable risks to protect it.”

-- Americans have already seen enough for three articles of impeachment, argues Jennifer Rubin, a lawyer by training.

-- As alarming as the allegations are against Trump, impeachment is still not required, writes Princeton University professor Keith Whittington: “The House would not necessarily be failing to do its ‘constitutional duty’ if it did not pass articles of impeachment.”

Refugees gather in front of the White House. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Trump administration slashed the number of refugees who will be admitted to the U.S. next year to a historic low of 18,000. David Nakamura, Maria Sacchetti and Seung Min Kim report: “The new limit represents a 40 percent drop from the 2019 cap and marks the third consecutive year that the administration has slashed the program since the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in President Barack Obama’s final year in office. In addition, the Trump administration announced an executive order aimed at allowing local jurisdictions more leeway in rejecting refugees who are being resettled across the country, although experts said such powers are less relevant at a time when the number of refugees being admitted has dwindled sharply.""

A breakdown of who is being let in: ""Under the plan for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, the administration would allocate 5,000 refugee slots to people fleeing for religious reasons, 4,000 for Iraqis who assisted the United States and fall under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, and 1,500 for nationals of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to senior administration officials. Another 7,500 slots would go to refugees not covered by these categories, including those referred to the program by U.S. embassies. Last year’s cap of 30,000 divided slots by region, including 11,000 refugees from Africa, the largest group, administration officials said. Latin America and the Caribbean had 3,000 slots last year.”

-- Matthew Albence, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, once again took aim at “sanctuary cities” that refuse to help the feds deport undocumented immigrants. This time, he did so from the podium in the White House briefing room. Maria Sacchetti reports: “Albence criticized jurisdictions in several states after the agency arrested nearly 1,300 migrants during the past week via Operation Cross Check, a recurring immigration roundup of people convicted of crimes that include murder, manslaughter and child abuse. Nearly 200 of those arrested could have been taken into custody in a state prison or a local jail, he said. Instead, they were released after posting bail or at the end of their sentences, forcing ICE agents to track them down. … Albence was flanked by sheriffs from Texas, North Dakota and other states where Trump enjoys broad support.”

-- Organizations challenging Trump’s attempt to end protections for the Dreamers picked Ted Olson, a former Republican solicitor general and lawyer long associated with conservative causes, to argue their case before the Supreme Court. The choice might’ve been more surprising had Olson not played a similar role in the legal battle for same-sex marriage. (Robert Barnes)

­-- An undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong house in Southaven, Miss. Now, the city is fighting a civil rights lawsuit by arguing that, because of his immigration status, he wasn’t protected by the U.S. Constitution. Antonia Noori Farzan reports: “Attorneys for the small city near Memphis claim that because [Ismael] Lopez had no ‘legally recognized relationship’ with the United States, he had no rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, or the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens. ‘If he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct,’ attorney Katherine S. Kerby wrote in a brief filed Sept. 4. ‘Ismael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the ‘We, the People of the United States’ entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit.’”

-- The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill that will keep the government open through Nov. 21. Erica Werner reports: “The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it. The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- The Senate also confirmed Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to succeed Alex Acosta as labor secretary. Felicia Sonmez and Eli Rosenberg report: “Scalia was confirmed Thursday on a 53-to-44 vote. Democrats have argued that Scalia’s record as a corporate lawyer has shown him to be ‘anti-worker.’ In remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) contended that Scalia fought to protect the interests of chief executives and the wealthy elite and opposed worker protections throughout his career, describing his nomination by Trump as a ‘disgrace.’”

-- And the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Trump’s pick to become the second-highest-ranking military officer after a bruising nomination fight centering on allegations of sexual assault from a former aide. Missy Ryan and Karoun Demirjian report: “Senators voted 75 to 22 to confirm Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, who has headed U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was the lone Republican to vote against Hyten, while all Democratic senators running for president either voted against him or were absent, save Michael F. Bennet of Colorado. Bennet voted in favor.”

-- The U.S. military’s suicide rate for active-duty troops has climbed over the past five years, a Pentagon report reveals. Dan Lamothe reports: “Some 541 service members died by suicide in 2018, including 325 active-duty troops, the report said. The active-duty suicide rate was about 24.8 per 100,000 service members, up from 21.9 in 2017 and 18.7 in 2013. … Service members who die by suicide continue to be mostly male, white and under the age of 30, said Karin Orvis, director of the Pentagon’s defense suicide prevention office. The Army and Marine Corps, the services with the highest suicide rates, also have the greatest percentage of men.”

-- Trump’s pick to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives faces growing Republican concerns over his commitment to gun rights. From the Journal: “Failing to confirm [Chuck] Canterbury would leave the ATF without a permanent, politically appointed director at a time when the law enforcement agency is at the forefront of the Trump administration’s fight against violent crime and as the White House and Congress continue to negotiate gun-control measures after several mass shootings in recent months. … Mr. Canterbury tangled in his July confirmation hearing with Republican senators who were frustrated that he wouldn’t clearly define his views on gun-control measures such as expanding background checks for prospective buyers and a ban on assault rifles. He was head of the FOP when it took positions supporting more-rigorous gun-control measures including an expansion of background checks. But he wouldn’t immediately say what stance he would take if confirmed to the ATF, only that he would consult with other Justice Department officials.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency formally told California it is “failing to meet its obligations” to protect the environment. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey report: “Days after President Trump mocked Los Angeles and other big cities for their ‘tremendous pollution,’ EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an oversight letter charging California officials with failing to meet federal health standards in numerous communities where large homeless populations litter the streets with trash, drug paraphernalia and human waste. … California has long led the nation in demanding stricter limits on pollution linked to climate change. Now, the Trump administration is arguing that the state’s focus on global warming has come at the expense of more basic environmental protections.”

-- Seeking to fill the void created by Trump's inaction, six U.S. governors gathered in Manhattan on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting to confer with presidents, prime ministers and other foreign leaders to press for action on climate change. Carol Morello reports: “The governors in the group, most of them Democrats, insist they are not conducting a form of shadow diplomacy. They say neither the White House nor the State Department, which typically conducts talks with foreign governments, has tried to deter their efforts. Their mission is to assure other countries that many of America’s leaders are still engaged in combating climate change, even if the United States formally drops out of the Paris agreement next year. ‘Every party looking at this should know there is still intelligent life in the United States taking action on climate change,’ Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a co-founder of the Climate Alliance, said in a back-seat interview en route to a meeting with officials from the European Union. ‘It’s important to give the world confidence of movement, of dynamic actions being taken in America. And it’s succeeded. Not a single country has left the agreement. No one has followed Donald Trump over the cliff.’”

-- A federal judge denied a request by the news media to unseal grand jury records cited in the Mueller report. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia said she was bound by the ruling, McKeever v. Barr, and that the petitioning party, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, did not qualify for other exceptions to grand jury secrecy rules.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden’s advisers are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street now that the former vice president stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a “wealth tax” on the richest Americans. Jeff Stein reports: “The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds ... Tax experts said Biden’s embrace of that idea would mark just how much more aggressive Democrats are now willing to be on taxes.”

-- Some anxious Biden supporters want him to embrace a super PAC. From the Times: “Several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. ‘For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,’ said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. ‘And I was already thinking the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we’d need to fight this.’”

-- Democratic donors from Wall Street are threatening to back Trump or sit out the 2020 campaign if Elizabeth Warren wins the nomination. From CNBC: “‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive ... Some big bank executives and hedge fund managers have been stunned by Warren’s ascent, and they are primed to resist her. ‘They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,’ an executive at one of the nation’s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity.”

-- White, college-educated voters are driving Warren's rise in the polls. Eugene Scott reports: “The lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.”

-- In a fundraising email, Julián Castro warned that his campaign will be over is he doesn’t qualify for the November debate. From the Texas Tribune: “The email sought donations for ads to help him reach the new polling threshold: 3% in four national polls or 5% in two surveys from the first four early voting states. Castro has already met the donor requirement of 165,000 individuals but hasn't met the polling requirement — or even come close.”

-- Sen. Kamala Harris, the former attorney general of California, said Giuliani should probably be disbarred. “We need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,” the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “And frankly, if there were any members of the State Department who were facilitating Rudy Giuliani’s private conversations on behalf of the president, there should be accountability and consequence for that.” (Politico)

-- Former congressman Darrell Issa is launching a primary challenge to embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who faces an impending trial for using campaign funds to help facilitate several extramarital affairs. (John Wagner)

-- Former Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price, who resigned in disgrace, threw his hat in the ring to take over retiring Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson’s Georgia seat. From ABC News: “According to the Georgia governor's office, Price submitted his resume to be considered for replacing Isakson, who announced in August that he is resigning from his post in December due to various health issues. Isakson, 74, won a six-year term in 2016 and his term is due to end in 2022.”

-- A U.S. attorney whose office investigated interference in the 2018 midterm elections said he is certain Russia will try to meddle in the upcoming presidential race. Rachel Weiner reports: “‘They’re going to do the same thing,’ G. Zachary Terwilliger said Thursday afternoon at an event at George Mason University’s National Security Institute. ‘They’re going to do it. In an open setting like this there’s not a lot I can get into, but I think it wouldn’t be irresponsible for me to say they’re definitely going to try.’ … Terwilliger said he had heard from an administration official that ‘their big concern is deepfakes,’ or doctored images and videos. But he said he was also worried about the ‘actual physical infrastructure’ of election machines, while cautioning that the issue was outside his purview.""

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Pentagon authorized a modest air defense boost for Saudi Arabia after the attack on the kingdom’s oil industry. Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe report: “Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper’s decision to authorize the deployment of an additional battery of Patriot missiles and four Sentinel radar systems, accompanied by 200 American troops, to shore up a key ally is a modest step that represents the administration’s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions. … Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the deployment would ‘augment the kingdom’s air and missile defense of critical military and civilian infrastructure.’ ‘These steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East,’ he said in a statement.”

-- Iraq is trying to rein in its Iran-aligned militias as tensions boil in the Persian Gulf. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “Iraqi officials are worried that their country could get sucked into the conflict, with concerns spiking after a May 14 drone strike on a pipeline in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The officials were embarrassed to learn that the attack had not come from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, who had claimed responsibility for the strike, but from Iraqi territory, said lawmakers and Western officials who described the fallout. ‘The prime minister was very angry,’ said one lawmaker. … Iraqi lawmakers fear that attacks launched from their soil would not only inflame regional tensions but could provoke reprisals against targets inside their country, drawing Iraq into another ruinous conflict.”

-- Syrian government forces carried out a chlorine attack in May, a U.S. intelligence assessment found. From the Journal: “The episode took place on May 19 near the village of Kabana as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces sought to subdue resistance in Latakia province, a senior U.S. official said. … At least four people were wounded in the rocket strike, which was alleged at the time by the Syrian opposition but took months for U.S. intelligence to confirm. The Syrian government has denied the attack.”

-- The fiancée of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi is demanding that Saudi Arabia be held accountable for his murder. Oct. 2 is the anniversary of his death. Hatice Cengiz spoke with NBC News on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly: ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet,’ she said. ""Saudi Arabia was put under massive pressure, thanks to international media coverage … But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad.""

-- Trump’s privately held company, seeking to revive its money-losing golf course in Scotland, secured approval to build 550 luxury and holiday homes there, as well as a second golf course. Joshua Partlow reports: “The Aberdeenshire Council voted 38 to 24 to allow the Trump Organization’s residential development to move forward despite vocal opposition from many residents who fear it would crowd the roads and schools of their windswept village. By winning the council’s approval, the Trump Organization is poised for one of its most ambitious foreign projects of his presidency. It is also a rescue effort of sorts for Trump’s first golf course in Europe, which has lost money each year since it opened in 2012. … In a sign of its confidence in Wednesday’s vote, the Trump Organization had already begun marketing the homes as part of what it called the Trump Estate, with some homes priced at more than $1.5 million.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing extensive backlash after delivering a bombastic performance upon his return to Parliament. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “The widower of a murdered lawmaker and the sister of the prime minister joined a chorus of voices on Thursday saying [Johnson] has stepped over a line with his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit. But Johnson was refusing to change course on his language or his strategy. … Johnson drew particular fury over his remarks about Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and Brexit opponent who was murdered days before a June 2016 referendum by a far-right domestic terrorist who yelled ‘Britain first!’ before shooting and stabbing her to death. … Johnson [said] that the best way to honor Cox’s memory would be to ‘get Brexit done.’ … Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister, an author and politician who opposes Brexit, called her brother’s remarks ‘tasteless.’”

-- Afghanistan's presidential election is this weekend, and voters are torn between fear, frustration and a sense of duty. From the AP: “The Taliban have relentlessly issued threats against Saturday’s vote. The insurgent group has sent suicide bombers to rallies and election offices, killing dozens and warning they will kill more. ... Afghan officials say security preparations have been elaborate. In an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Interior Masoud Andarabi outlined an election security plan that he said has been more than eight months in the making. ... Despite the government’s best efforts, 431 polling centers will be closed Saturday because Andarabi, the interior minister, said they were too difficult to secure — either because they were under Taliban control or Taliban could threaten nearby villages.”

-- Concerns about fraud are also running high among the public and observers because it could trigger political chaos. The main challenger to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani warned of dire consequences if the polls are marred by fraud. Pamela Constable and Susannah George report: “Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan’s chief executive, did not say what he would do if massive fraud takes place, but he suggested in an interview that it would be up to Ghani to ‘act responsibly.’ ‘The results will not be accepted if there is clear evidence of fraud,” Abdullah said at his residence. ‘The signs are not good. . . . It is not an ideal situation for the country,’ he added, referring to warnings by opposition groups and leaders, including himself, that Ghani and his government will try to rig the polls.”

Those efforts prompted that whistleblower complaint that was released this morning and have led to an official impeachment inquiry.

The White House counsel helped to identify legal obstacles to the disclosure of information that could be politically damaging to Trump. The head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a classified opinion to initially block the whistleblower’s complaint from being transmitted to congressional committees that are legally entitled to receive it. The director of DOJ’s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community’s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden. And Bill Barr declined to recuse himself, even though Trump invoked the attorney general at least twice during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Here’s a quick primer on why each of the four taxpayer-funded attorneys is in the spotlight:

Steven Engel, director of the Office of Legal Counsel:

In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump’s call. The IG said this was credible and urgent and should be turned over to Congress. But then Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI, contacted the Justice Department to ask for guidance. Engel issued a secret memo on Sept. 3 saying that the complaint didn’t need to be turned over to congressional intelligence committee because it was outside of the DNI’s jurisdiction. Instead, he said the allegation would more properly be referred to the Justice Department as a potential criminal matter for further review. (The DOJ published yesterday an unclassified version of Engel’s legal reasoning.)

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal division:

When the intelligence community IG submitted a criminal referral that said the president possibly violated campaign finance laws, it was Benczkowski who made the call within a matter of weeks that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation of Trump. He’s a former Senate GOP staffer who worked at the same law firm as Barr before being appointed to the job. Benczkowski’s confirmation was held up for a stretch two years ago because of his legal work for a Russian bank.

“Senior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to ‘quantify’ the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the ‘best evidence’ to help determine what to do,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. “The FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. … They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.”

“All relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

Attorney General Bill Barr:

Justice Department officials also said that the attorney general was “generally knowledgeable” of discussions about Engel’s decision but he didn’t make the call not to move forward with the investigation.

Kupec, Barr’s spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

She added that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” per Devlin, Matt, Carol Leonnig and Shane Harris.

But Democrats said Barr should have recused himself entirely. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Barr to not be involved with anything related to Ukraine and this episode. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate and formerly California’s attorney general, demanded that Barr testify under oath before Congress as soon as possible about his role.

“Trump has repeatedly lauded Barr, a stark contrast from his relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions,” the AP’s Michael Balsamo and Mark Sherman note. “Not only did Barr provide the first, favorable framing for the Mueller report, but he also … has supported the White House’s decision to claim broad executive privilege to prevent the testimony of administration officials that could be potentially damaging for Trump. Barr has also defied subpoenas from Congress — in line with the Trump administration’s stance to block Democrats’ efforts to investigate Trump.”

White House counsel Pat Cipollone:

Cipollone has been engaged in this matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, we reported last week, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump.

Three of my colleagues revealed yesterday that Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he was going to testify about the whistleblower complaint. “He has at times expressed his displeasure to [Cipollone] and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community,” according to Greg Miller, Shane and Karoun Demirjian. “The current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint … It was unclear whether Maguire’s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.”

Maguire denied that he ever threatened to resign, and the White House also disputed the account. After their statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, “We stand by the story.”

TRUMP’S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS ALSO IN THE SPOTLIGHT:

-- In the rough transcript, Trump praises Rudy Giuliani as a “highly respected man” who was a “great mayor” of New York. “If you could speak to him that would be great,” the president tells Zelensky.

-- “Giuliani has claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials have been at the request of the State Department, which remained fully abreast of his dealings. But the details of the July 25 phone call … raise new questions about Giuliani’s role, reinforcing the view of some U.S. officials that he operates at the president’s behest, often in a closed loop, and occasionally in contravention to the messages of diplomats in Kiev,” John Hudson reports. “Technically, it is illegal for private citizens to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the United States under the Logan Act, but the law has rarely been enforced. Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani’s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government …

“Giuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. A State Department official said Giuliani ‘does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government’ and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak’s request. Yermak’s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call. U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said. Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.

“In May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky — who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution — had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early. Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a ‘prosecutor to a former prosecutor.’ But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the ‘black ledger’ that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened. Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: ‘I’m not going to tell you about that.’”

-- Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: “These records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.

“Through these deliberations carried on by his attorneys, Manafort exhorted the White House to press Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit individuals, both in the US and in Ukraine, who he believed had published damning information about his political consulting work in the Ukraine. … [The records show that] on at least three occasions, [Giuliani] was in communication with Manafort’s legal team to discuss how the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had ‘colluded’ to defeat [Trump’s] 2016 presidential bid.”

-- The phone call memo followed Trump’s long obsession with Ukraine. More details from the New York Times: “Long before the July 25 call ... Trump’s focus on Ukraine started after a law enforcement organization, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine, released damaging information about cash payments earmarked to [Manafort] by the Russia-aligned political party of Ukraine’s ousted former president. Even after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign under pressure, he insisted to Mr. Trump’s aides that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was behind the surfacing of the documents revealing the payments, and questioned the authenticity of the documents. … The issue continued to fester with Mr. Trump. He tweeted six months after his inauguration about ‘Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign’ and to ‘boost Clinton,’ and asked, ‘where is the investigation?’”

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT:

-- Read it for yourself here.

-- “The whistleblower complaint focuses largely on the July 25 call … But the complaint also broadly alleges an effort by Trump and [Giuliani] to pressure Ukrainian officials over time … The whistleblower paints a picture, also using public news reports, to suggest that Giuliani pressured Ukrainian officials to further Trump’s interest in investigating his political opponents,” Devlin, Matt, Carol and Shane report.

“The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored … The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call...""

-- “The whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint … [and] the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,” the Times reports. “Mr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public … Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had ‘abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,’ the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.”

­-- The whistleblower tentatively agreed to testify on the condition that Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the person’s lawyers, so they can accompany their client, CNN reports.

THE ATMOSPHERICS ON CAPITOL HILL:

-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting after the release of the rough transcript they should narrow their impeachment investigation to Trump's dealings on Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Democrats said the evidence was incriminating enough — and easy enough for voters to understand — to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. ‘Strike while the iron’s hot,’ said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year. … [Pelosi] told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months — though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment ...

“Multiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.”

-- A milestone: A majority of House members are now on the record in support of opening an impeachment inquiry. As of last night, 217 House Democrats and one independent (Justin Amash) say they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 25 have gone a step further, saying they would definitely support impeaching the president. (The Fix is keeping a live whip count here.)

-- That op-ed published by seven House Democratic freshmen from swing districts with national security credentials proved seismic in pushing both wavering Democrats and Pelosi toward supporting an impeachment inquiry. Paul Kane explains: “Throughout the first phase of the Trump investigations, focusing on Russian interference in 2016, these Democrats found that their constituents were confused by the complicated and long-running investigation by [Mueller]. Instead, while other freshmen got media attention for bashing Trump, this group focused on kitchen-table issues like health-care costs and infrastructure projects. ... Liberal activists tried to jam their town halls, but most Democratic aides reported that aside from one or two impeachment questions, the overwhelming majority of concerns focused on local economic matters. … To be sure, a dozen or so swing-seat Democrats remain mum, declining so far to take a position ... But no one spoke out against impeachment in their Tuesday afternoon huddle in the Capitol basement.""

-- Some House Democrats say they wish Pelosi had waited a little longer. “I don’t get surprised often,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.). “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.” (Mike DeBonis has more.)

THE GOP RESPONSE:

-- ""The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct,"" Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: ""Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election. ...

""On Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood — 'chagrined' but not angry, though skittish about some of the details. At one point, the group began joking with the president that 'this was one of his better' phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.""

-- While most Republican senators publicly toed the line and repeated talking points sent by the White House, several were privately stunned and questioned Trump's judgment after seeing the rough transcript. Robert Costa reports: “One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a ‘huge mistake’ that the GOP now has to confront and defend — while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions ... that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. Publicly, two senators expressed serious concerns about the revelation, as cracks have begun to emerge with GOP lawmakers privately discussing Trump’s conduct and their party’s political standing.""

“Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters.

(R-Neb.) told reporters. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

(R-Utah) told reporters. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said there was “no quid pro quo,” adding, “while the conversation reported in the memorandum … was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”

“One early divide among Senate Republicans is between the ‘Burr camp’ and the ‘Johnson camp,’ according to two senior GOP aides,"" Costa reports, ""referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr’s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump’s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee’s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails while serving as secretary of state.""

-- He does not get a vote, but Vermont’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, said the impeachment inquiry is “appropriate,” per the AP.

-- The impeachment inquiry is threatening to derail most of Trump's domestic agenda, upending trade and spending talks. From Erica Werner and David Lynch: “The White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.""

THE UKRAINE ANGLE:

-- Trump’s meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly offered a platform for salesmanship, grievance and a joke or two. Anne Gearan reports: “‘We spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember,’ Trump cracked. … Zelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that ‘it’s better to be on TV than by phone.’ … Standing alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that ‘nobody pushed me’ to investigate. ‘I think you read everything,’ Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras. ‘I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved’ in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. ‘No, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.’ Trump chimed in: ‘In other words, no pressure.’""

-- Trump called former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin a “very good” prosecutor.” But Shokin resigned in disgrace. David L. Stern reports: Shokin “became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership. At the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors … Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine’s shadows. By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.”

-- Trump boasted about U.S. aid to Ukraine. But America isn’t Kiev’s only friend, writes Ruby Mellen: “Although the United States is one of the country’s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine. The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.”

-- “The U.S. tried to fix Ukraine’s government. We exported our corruption, instead,” laments Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

DOMESTIC POLITICAL FALLOUT:

-- During the Ukraine call, Trump revived a pervasive conspiracy theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima report: “For years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world’s most notorious hacks. … Ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into [DNC] computers in 2016, … CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and [into the president’s call].”

The nature of Trump’s reference to CrowdStrike in his call is not obvious in the White House’s memo, but, basically, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists who have falsely claimed it helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a party insider. In reality, Drew and Ellen explain, “the FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike.""

-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer. Michael Kranish reports: “Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, ‘Secret Empires,’ that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013. … Trump on Wednesday put it this way: ‘When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that’s a horrible thing.’ … In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.

""Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion. Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount. However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.”

-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: “He attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms. … Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states. Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of ‘socialism.’”

-- “An impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats’ choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place,"" writes Karen Tumulty. ""Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder — and maybe impossible — to make their voices heard in the din. ‘Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,’ says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama’s chief strategist.”

-- Trump’s call with Zelensky is unlike anything scholars have heard before, reports Karen DeYoung: “‘This is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,’ said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate. ‘Nixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,’ Hughes said. But ‘when he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,’ Nixon did it at home, he said. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, ‘tended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,’ said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. ‘He was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.’”

-- Before the transcript was released, former New Jersey governor and the onetime Trump transition chief Chris Christie ominously said that Trump would be in trouble if he said something like “do me a favor.” Hours later, it was revealed the president asked the Ukrainian president to “do us a favor.” (Mediaite)

-- The Wall Street Journal stands behind its reporting that Trump pressured Zelensky to work with Giuliani about eight times, despite claims from Trump allies and conservative media that it's wrong. The Journal notes the rough transcript is incomplete. There are also ellipses. (Erik Wemple)

NOTEWORTHY COMMENTARY:

-- Tuesday was Pelosi’s day, but Wednesday was Trump’s – for better or for worse, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “The impeachment inquiry is both an epic battle between the speaker and the president and, more fundamentally, a constitutional clash that will help define the limits on presidential power, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The outcome will shape, perhaps decisively, the 2020 campaign. Trump will either be out of office by January 2021 or he will have emerged victorious, reelected to a second term in large part because of what would then, inevitably, be interpreted as an enormous gamble by the speaker and the Democrats that went terribly wrong. The past two days have shown that there is no turning back.”

-- The Trump-Ukraine transcript contains evidence of a quid pro quo, writes National Review’s David French, a leading conservative attorney: “The transcript provides proof that Trump made a completely improper request that the president of Ukraine work with Trump’s personal counsel to investigate a political rival. It provides strong evidence that this took place in the context of a quid pro quo for desperately needed military aid.”

-- The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president, says The Post’s Editorial Board.

-- The rough transcript of the call is devastating. How could Trump not realize that? Max Boot wonders: “At least Richard Nixon had the good sense to resist releasing the ‘smoking gun’ tape until finally forced to do so by the Supreme Court. … Trump, by contrast, is so clueless — so lacking in even the most basic sense of right and wrong — that he could actually tweet this morning: ‘Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?’”

-- Democrats had no idea Trump would hand them so much ammo, writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

-- The House doesn’t need an impeachment inquiry to confirm Trump’s wrongdoing. His corruption is hidden in plain sight – just look at his D.C. hotel, argues Dana Milbank: “As the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any ‘foreign state’). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.”

THE TRUMP AGENDA:

-- The administration announced an asylum deal with Honduras, which could force migrants into one of the world’s most violent nations. Nick Miroff reports: “Department of Homeland Security officials reached the accord with the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is embroiled in allegations of government corruption and charges that he and others have been operating the nation as a criminal enterprise — Hernández has been named as a co-conspirator in a major U.S. drug trafficking case. The deal paves the way for the United States to take asylum seekers from the U.S. border and ship them to a nation with one of the highest murder rates in the world, a country with gang wars that have fueled waves of mass migration and multiple ‘caravans’ to the United States that became a major irritant to [Trump].”

-- The new deal comes just days after a man was brutally murdered in Honduras -- just hours after being deported from the United States. (La Prensa)

-- The Republican-controlled Senate voted for the second time to overturn Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but the body once again fell well short of the veto-proof, two-thirds majority needed to block the president from diverting military construction money to his pet project. (Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg)

-- Human rights groups demanded that ICE release all LGBTQ detainees and anyone with HIV in the agency’s custody. Robert Moore reports: “‘We know that lack of medical and mental-health care, including lack of HIV care, is the norm,’ Roger Coggan, director of legal services at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told reporters Wednesday afternoon. ‘By the Department of Homeland Security’s own count, 300 individuals identifying as transgender have been in custody and at the mercy of ICE since October of 2018. These cruel incarcerations need to stop immediately.’ DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint. It is unclear how many LGBTQ people and people with HIV are detained by U.S. immigration officials.”

-- Trump's decision to move the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service out of Washington will cause “significant delays” in vital research reports on which farmers depend. Politico reports: “ERS conducts research into areas such as climate change, nutrition, export data and the farm economy. Farmers also heavily rely on its outlook reports to make planting decisions. Crop markets can swing on the results of the numbers. ... USDA identified 38 specific reports that may be delayed because staff members have departed.""

­-- Income inequality has grown, including in heartland states. From the AP: “The nation’s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau’s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of ‘0’ indicates perfect equality, while a score of ‘1’ indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.”

-- The Federal Aviation Administration disputed an independent watchdog’s finding that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing’s 737 Max jets were underqualified. Ian Duncan reports: “Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog’s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was ‘not what happened,’ ... that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was ‘simply not accurate.’”

-- Trump’s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional materials distributed at private meetings with American military air crews. From The Scotsman: “The document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at ‘closed’ meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasizes the ‘five star’ status of the US president’s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been ‘newly refurbished.’ Two sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses the United Nations General Assembly. (Craig Ruttle/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The White House banned Iranian officials from entering the U.S. just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly, per the Times: “Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.""

-- Shortly after, Rouhani warned the Persian Gulf is ""on the edge of collapse."" From the AP: ""Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in 'international piracy' against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran 'will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,' Rouhani said ... 'Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.' ... Rouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington 'unable to resolve the more sophisticated issues' plaguing the Middle East.""

-- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaking about his role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder for the first time, said it was done without his knowledge. From Frontline: “‘It happened under my watch,’ the Saudi leader [said.] ‘I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.’ But he insists that it was without his knowledge. … [bin Salman was pressed] on how the murder could have happened without him knowing about it. ‘We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,’ Prince Mohammed responded. … ‘I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they’re responsible, they have the authority to do that,’ Prince Mohammed said.”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try forming a new governing coalition. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority. But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.”

-- Returning to Westminster, Prime Minister Boris Johnson goaded opposition lawmakers to call a no-confidence vote or agree to a general election and bring the Brexit fight back to the people after the Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was ‘wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.’ Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.”

-- At least 70 countries have engaged in disinformation campaigns, according to a new report by researchers at Oxford University. From the NYT: “In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia’s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor. Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing … The researchers … found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.”

-- Military drones are now common in nearly 100 nations, a new report found. From the WSJ: “China is a top exporter of drones alongside Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Pentagon officials have expressed concern over Beijing’s dominance of the global market for small drones. There are at least 21,000 and probably more than 30,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in military service world-wide, the report says. It catalogs 171 types of drones in military inventories and 268 military-drone units established by 58 countries. Fifteen countries have training academies for drone operators, and seven maintain drone bases outside their own borders, according to the report.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Cindy McCain, widow of John McCain, criticized the GOP, saying it is no longer the party she and her husband belonged to. Kim Bellware reports: McCain, when asked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election, “pointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that ‘it’s not functioning well’ and excludes people who aren’t ‘walking the line.’ ‘That’s just not right,’ McCain said. ‘That’s not the party my husband and I belonged to.’ While those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party’s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state’s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized — and vocal — Latino population and transplants from around the country. … ‘I can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,’ McCain said. ‘I’m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.’”

-- Elizabeth Warren is rising everywhere, per CNN: “The latest Quinnipiac University national poll ... has Warren at 27% to [Biden’s] 25%. Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. ... The trendline is what is important here.""

-- A volunteer for Warren’s campaign was killed in a car crash in western Iowa. Zachary Crombie Presberg, 22, joined the campaign as a summer organizing fellow and had stayed on as a volunteer. (Des Moines Register)

-- More infighting: Top aides are privately questioning Bernie Sanders's strategy. From CNN: “The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air. … Even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away. The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.”

-- Biden’s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president’s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden “made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate. James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico]. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. 'He said his brother would be very excited about this product,' Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.”

-- Cory Booker has crossed the halfway threshold to his $1.7 million fundraising goal. His campaign manager said that he needs to raise that much in the final 10 days of September to have a viable path forward, per Yahoo News.

-- Tulsi Gabbard qualified for the fourth Democratic debate after missing out on the third one. The Hawaii Democrat has the support of 2 percent of registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters, according to a Monmouth University poll, per the Columbus Dispatch.

A Democratic congressman from Arizona, an Iraq War veteran, explained why it was so significant Trump asked for a favor right after Ukraine's president said they wanted to buy more Javelins:

The Javelin was specifically designed to take out Russian tanks. It is laser guided, can deployed by one person, training is quick and has a 2 kilometer range.

A CNN reporter highlighted Lindsey Graham's situational approach to impeachment:

Graham, 1999: “You don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job ...if this body determines that your conduct ...is clearly out of bounds in your role. ...Impeachment is about cleansing the office.

In total, the Trump campaign and its backers spent between $346,700 and $1,430,182 on more than 2,000 ads for its Facebook page from Monday to midday Friday, according to data analyzed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. She obtained the data through Facebook’s public ad archive, which reports all of its data in ranges, not precise figures. Those ads had been viewed between 13.3 million and 25.3 million times, the NYU analysis found.

On Tuesday and Wednesday alone, the campaign shelled out about $500,000 on Facebook ads, according to figures tallied by ACRONYM, a digital outfit focused on liberal causes. On Wednesday alone it spent about $350,000, an amount it typically spends in a week.

The online offensive offered a window into Trump’s bare-knuckle approach to the coming impeachment battles, as he took the showdown to his favored terrain: the Internet. Already, campaign officials say they have filled their coffers with contributions: Eric Trump, the president’s second son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said Thursday that the campaign had raised $8.5 million in the previous 24 hours.

The Facebook ads, which traffic in claims found to be false by The Washington Post Fact Checker, also provided a new test for the technology giant after it reaffirmed this week it would exempt speech by politicians from fact checking. That exemption, company executives said, also applies to ads, though sponsored posts are required to meet community standards that proscribe threats as well as “content aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive another of money, property, or legal right.”

On Friday, Facebook said none of the ads violated its policies, including those that prohibit dehumanizing speech, though the company did not detail its reasoning. A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

As Trump flooded social media with impeachment-related advertising, would-be challengers competing for the Democratic nomination moved gingerly on the platforms. While it appeared that every one of the hundreds of ads placed by Trump’s campaign since Tuesday used the word “impeachment,” not a single ad placed by Joe Biden, the former vice president, used the word. Biden said this week he would favor impeachment proceedings if the White House tried to thwart congressional oversight activities.

AD

AD

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala D. Harris of California, both of whom had previously called for the president’s impeachment, each ran ads on the topic but far fewer than the general fundraising appeals they released that made no mention of the president.

In ads targeting mainly women, Warren asked users to sign a petition calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. Harris asked users, mainly in California, to sign a card thanking Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the speaker of the House, “for showing the leadership the White House lacks by beginning an impeachment inquiry.”

Biden, who became the subject of a July conversation between Trump and the president of Ukraine, placed new ads condemning the president for soliciting help from a foreign leader to smear him. But Biden stopped short of mentioning impeachment.

AD

AD

In addition to the individual candidates, the national party committees produced dueling advertising on the topic, with the Democratic National Committee asking users to donate to show their support for an impeachment inquiry and the Republican National Committee asking users to “stand against impeachment.” The GOP’s ads appeared to target in particular a swath of states in the Midwest, as well as New York, Pennsylvania and Maine.

The RNC said Friday it would join the Trump campaign in spending a total of $10 million across television and digital platforms assailing Democrats for beginning an impeachment inquiry. The campaign will spend $8 million, while the party will kick in another $2 million.

For months, Facebook spending on impeachment has been dominated by Tom Steyer, the investor turned impeachment activist, and his super PAC, Need to Impeach. Warren has been next in line, spending about $34,000 on the issue between Aug. 31 and Sept. 21, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic communications agency.

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

Ben: Over the last few months, Joe Biden has managed to fend off persistent criticism about his record, his handsiness, and his age, among other things, maintaining a consistent lead in Democratic primary polls all the while. But with the explosion of the Trump-Ukraine revelations, he finds himself in the middle of a scandal that’s really about the president’s corruption — but which also makes him an easy target for the right, who claim that he and his son Hunter are the real villains in all this. Meanwhile, in a possibly related development, Elizabeth Warren is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire. Is this whole thing a curse for Biden?

Gabriel: There’s definitely a lot going on here, but first let’s note: Warren’s upward trend has been going on for quite a long time. It’s not like she’s shot up in the polls as Trump has pushed his line on Biden’s “scandal” — which, let’s also be clear, there’s still no evidence to support is a real one. All that said, it’s hard to see how this is a net positive for Biden if it continues to be covered and thought about like it has been so far. His team has made a fairly persuasive case that Trump has been so focused on Biden, including in pushing this Ukraine theory, because he is most worried about him in a general election. That, of course, makes sense: Just look at the preliminary polling that shows Biden beating Trump consistently. This is great for Biden’s central message of electability. However, a lot of the coverage — i.e., the way real voters are consuming this saga — has nonetheless put new scrutiny on Biden’s son, Hunter, in a way that’s hard for Biden to defend, even if the actual substance of Hunter’s work wasn’t illegal, and the specific accusations about Joe Biden, as vice-president, interfering in Ukrainian investigations is unfounded.

But I think it’s instructive to look at how Biden himself is talking about all this. Here he is at a fundraiser in California yesterday: “Now, I know that even though there’s not been one single shred of evidence substantiating any accusation made, and today, the leading prosecutor, the headline in the Washington Post was, the prosecutor in, that they’re trying to convince to say something differently, in, in Ukraine said there’s nothing anybody in my family did wrong or at all. But folks, this isn’t about me. It’s never been about me. It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives. Health care, education, the godawful rampant gun violence that’s going on, and maybe the single most important consequential thing is climate change. So I’m not going to let him do it. This is not about me, this is about the American people and the issues that matter to them.”

This was after he recounted the actual big deal here: Trump’s call, and the whistle-blower’s report. So Biden clearly wants to talk about his own family … not at all.

Ben: Right. And he seemed a little bit tentative in his initial response to all this, which is a bit odd, considering the gravity and outrageousness of what the president was trying to do to him.

Gabriel: It’s useful to think of it all in the context of Biden’s whole career and political persona. He is very, very, very protective of his family, understandably, and simultaneously very invested in what he perceives to be his image as a straight shooter. So this is a double whammy.

Again, though, there’s no evidence that the accusations are true. Can’t stress that enough. So it’s understandable that there are a lot of nerves in Democratic circles that analysts/pundits are talking around that fact and immediately jumping to: doesn’t this look bad for Biden? I can’t tell you how many Clinton ‘16 alums have made a complaint like that to me in recent days. Not complaining about Biden’s actions, to be clear, but about how Trump has warped the public discussion around him to drag his opponent down.

Ben: So you’re saying the allegations might be true? #democrathoax

Gabriel: You’ll have to check the transcript memo.

Ben: Yes, it is crazy-making that we’re all aware of the game Trump is playing, and then we have to do this kind of meta-questioning of whether it’s working. I mean, I’m doing that right now. But, as I was saying to our colleague Ed yesterday, logic and fairness and rationality isn’t really the name of the game in politics, especially at the moment.

Gabriel: Well, I think it’s not crazy to assert that Biden’s entire pitch is based on the premise that you’ll be proven wrong about that.

Ben: That rationality is making a comeback?

Gabriel: That reason will prevail.

Ben: It may, but there will still be a dangerously high level of silliness floating around.

Gabriel: All this said, I think there’s a real question about how other Democratic candidates talk about this.

There’s already been some obvious discomfort. Warren was asked if her VP’s son could work abroad like Hunter Biden, and she initially said no, then said she had to check her plan to be sure. Castro has basically just defended Biden and refused to engage. No one has said “this is corrupt!” or agreed with Trump, obviously, but they’re proceeding with immense caution.

Ben: Yeah, it’s a bit like the age issue. Pressing it too overtly is likely to backfire, as Castro recently learned.

Reporting indicates that Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats want to do this impeachment thing pretty quickly. Do you get the sense that the Biden camp is relieved about that fact? That by the time Iowa rolls around, the process might already be over?

Gabriel: It’s very hard to tell, I think they’re still trying to figure it out, just like everyone else. If you’re a leading candidate, though, the prospect of an impeachment proceeding playing out during the primaries is a bit scary, since the politics of the impeachment are completely up in the air. It’s just an unpredictable landscape. That said, obviously Biden’s team doesn’t want “Biden,” “corruption,” “Ukraine,” “investigation” to show up in context-free headlines for the next six months (even if the other words in the headline are “Trump” “impeach,” etc.), but realistically the ongoing impeachment process is likely to move the national focus even further away from the narrow question of Hunter Biden’s work, anyway. Republicans may continue to press on the Biden accusations, but that’s likely the case, no matter how long the impeachment inquiry takes.

Ben: Biden hasn’t been shy about going after Trump directly — his whole early strategy was to paint the president as a sui generis monster, which was in contrast to some of his rivals, who tended not to focus so much on the president (until they saw how well it was working for Biden). Could this episode work to his advantage in that it provides more evidence that Trump simply needs to be thrown out of office, and the one person who can do that is Joe?

Gabriel: That’s what Biden is betting. Look at what his campaign manager said to Politico for a story this morning: “Why are you punching someone? Because you’re afraid of them.” The question is how Biden communicates that to voters without amplifying Trump’s attacks. And, just as importantly, how other candidates counter it without feeding into Trump’s line of argument.

Ben: To return to Warren: Perhaps the clearest sign yet of her threat to Biden is that his campaign is reportedly mulling a wealth tax, cribbing a page from her (and Bernie Sanders’s) playbook. Does this strike you as a sound political strategy?

Gabriel: I mean, he’s been saying over and over at private fundraisers, surrounded by rich people: Don’t expect anything from me, I’m not going to make your lives easier. So no one is going to start thinking of Biden as a crusader against the one percent, obviously, but it may soften some of the criticisms from the left, just a tiny bit. We don’t know what this’ll look like, yet, though. Reports just have his advisers “considering” the move. It’s not like he’s trying to win over the Bernie ‘16 crowd, just to prove he gets it. And FWIW I think the clearest sign of her threat to Biden is her beating him in polling.

Ben: Fair enough.

Gabriel: Going back to how Biden talks about all this, and everyone else responds, for a sec: We may have just gotten a very consequential development. CNN and the Times, who are co-hosting the next debate, just announced that it’ll be one night only. And we know that there are almost certainly going to be 12 candidates onstage, which by definition means candidates will have less time than ever to actually talk, unless the debate is, like, four hours long. There’s no way Trump’s impeachment doesn’t come up pretty prominently, obviously, so we’ll see soon how candidates talk about Biden’s side of this. What do you think would be an effective way for a long shot who needs Biden to falter to answer the question?

Ben: The questionee has become the questioner.

Were I a long-shot candidate, I don’t think my strategy would be to go after Biden directly on this issue. I don’t think it would engender any sympathy from Democratic voters — and this is the sort of thing that’s so thick in the air that it doesn’t need explicating. But perhaps you could get away with some more subtle questioning of Biden’s electability, which is his most powerful argument for the nomination. You could mention that Biden has a lot of baggage (which is true) without directly tying it to impeachment. What do you think?

Gabriel: You could try it, but the last three people to go after Biden in debates, however subtly or overtly, only got very momentary support, if any, out of doing it (Harris, Booker, Castro.) The most effective play in the eyes of voters might be to say exactly what Biden is saying: This is a distraction, and we can’t afford to be distracted. That’s saying something similar without actually saying it. But that’s also admitting Trump has way more power to set the conversation than you probably want to admit."

The closing days of a fundraising quarter are usually hectic for presidential candidates and their top-level staffers, who are tasked with pulling in every last dime they can find and figuring out what to do with the cash. This week — punctuated by the lightning-fast ramp-up of an official impeachment inquiry into the president — was different. By Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced the move, it was clear to aides of most of the 18 at-least-semi-serious remaining Democratic campaigns that, with the country’s attention squarely on Capitol Hill and the White House, they’d suddenly fallen further off the national radar than ever before. By Thursday, that attention was even more intensely focused, and a handful of campaign operatives began ringing internal alarm bells so loudly that their candidates had no choice but to start reckoning with the painful reality that no one cares about them right now. By the end of the week, in campaign offices scattered across the country, senior-level operatives finally sat down in small groups to discuss what the path forward now looks like for their campaigns — or, in some cases, whether they have realistic ones at all. A senior aide to one campaign described his team’s Friday gathering as “a ‘we’re fucked, what do we do?’ meeting.”

The big-picture strategic concern for every campaign now is that no one has any clue how long the impeachment process will take, what kind of attention it will command, or which way its politics will break. (See: Joe Biden’s team using Donald Trump’s lashing out as evidence of Biden’s electability — proving the president is most worried about the former vice-president in the general election — while much of the rest of the field quietly bets that the deluge of news about his son will sink Biden.) But the more immediate problem for almost everyone in the still-massive field not named Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg is money. Specifically, having enough of it to maintain real campaigns for the next few months.

That’s because impeachment, for this crowd, couldn’t have come at a more delicate time: the end of the final quarter before most pols believe the race gets serious, and therefore the exact moment they were banking on generating as much coverage and attention as possible, to raise as much money as possible — to keep afloat for as long as possible, or to finally make much-needed campaign hires and investments just as voters start paying serious attention. Take Cory Booker, whose campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, circulated a memo last Saturday morning ringing his own alarm. He wrote that if the senator didn’t raise $1.7 million in the final ten days of the quarter — which ends with September, on Monday — he would have to drop out, deprived of a “legitimate long-term path forward,” in Demissie’s words. This show of vulnerability (a classic Booker maneuver, to those who know him best and are used to his attention-grabbing tactics) seemed to work at first: Money poured in, setting him up to hit the stated mark. Other campaigns watched closely for clues as to how to replicate that success, since Demissie had simply stated out loud what a handful of other campaign managers would admit only in private about their finances. But Booker’s fundraising pace slowed as the week progressed, and as the impeachment inquiry comprehensively smothered attention to any other topic, including the Democratic primary and Booker’s push.

Booker may have raised enough in the first few days to survive. But the squeeze is now on.

“The media, prior to this, was already making it a three-to-five person race, and now there’s a solar eclipse of a story that will make it really, really difficult to drive any message,” says Glen Caplin, who was a senior advisor to Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “The entire conversation now is going to be driven around Trump and impeachment, and it’s going to be a real challenge for candidates in the bottom five to get coverage, and even those in the top five to drive it on any given day.”

A senior aide to one candidate still in the race put it a little less delicately: “It sucks, actually. Impeachment’s gonna kill anyone who’s not a senator or in the top five. We’re fucked.”

The likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn’t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (“It’s been the most nationalized race I’ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,” said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it’s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the “one way you can break through right now,” since ads aren’t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn’t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, “the choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,” said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. “The main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.”

Some candidates could raise money off their potential involvement in impeachment, most prominently the House members or the senators who could have a vote on Trump’s ultimate fate. (Supporters of Kamala Harris, for one, have been highlighting clips of her past questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr.) But this has, for now, proven an unconvincing pitch for potential supporters, according to people familiar with multiple candidates’ digital fundraising numbers.

So far, candidates are largely playing it safe and keeping their heads down — they’ll answer questions about impeachment when asked, and issue statements, but no campaign has yet reset its messaging to be all about Trump’s corruption or the investigation. Even billionaire Tom Steyer — who rose to national prominence in part by campaigning for Trump’s impeachment, and who doesn’t need to raise money but could use all the attention he can get — unveiled a new global climate plan on Friday, sticking to his pre-impeachment plan. Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled a public lands proposal. But as the week closed, some aides for other campaigns considered last-ditch direction changes at their “we’re fucked” meetings. “You basically have two choices: Say outlandish shit about impeachment, or do something so big that people have to pay attention. Hard to do at tier two or below,” said one top strategist for a candidate who will, at least, make the next debate stage.

And, as Julián Castro can attest, distinguishing oneself as especially aggressive on the investigations has little demonstrated upside for lower-tier contenders. The former Housing Secretary was the first candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment in April, but he saw little if any polling bump from it. Warren, on the other hand, jumpstarted her struggling campaign in part by making a similar call after Castro.

The best bet for some such hopefuls, then, might simply be hoping the pace of impeachment news slows, and that this week’s deluge proves atypical. “I’m not sure how long it’s gonna last,” said one strategist for a faltering campaign.

Castro, for one, appears to have a similar wish. And he needs all the help he can get. “I don’t say this lightly,” he wrote to supporters on Thursday. “If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.”"

Are they simply marching, or are they politically engaged more generally? Here’s what I found.

Here’s how I did my research

AD

I collected data from participants at the Climate Strike in D.C. on Sept. 20. A 13-person research team (including me) snaked through the crowd as they lined up at John Marshall Park before they began marching, sampling every fifth person at designated increments to gather a field approximation of a random sample. In total, we collected data from 193 participants at the event, with a response rate of 79 percent.

AD

What we found is consistent with my findings from earlier research on the youth climate movement and on those with experience in what many have called the “resistance”: the broader movement that has been challenging President Trump’s administration and its polices since January 2017. Participants in the Climate Strike were predominantly female. The median age of the crowd was 22 years old. Three-quarters, or 76 percent, of the participants will be eligible to vote in the U.S. 2020 election. And their current levels of civic engagement strongly suggests they will vote.

As part of this survey, we asked participants the following question: “If the 2020 election were held today (no matter whether you are eligible to vote), who would you vote for?” Forty-one percent supported Elizabeth Warren, with by far the largest share. Bernie Sanders came in second with 20 percent of the support. Joe Biden was a distant third with 12 percent.

AD

Most participants in the Climate Strike identified as being on the political left, while 9 percent identified as politically moderate. Interestingly, those who identified themselves as “Very Left” on the political spectrum (24 percent of the crowd) also favored Warren (46 percent) over Sanders (33 percent).

AD

These activists are significantly more engaged in a range of political activities than the general American population: 46 percent reported contacting an elected official in the past year; 46 percent attended a public, town, or school meeting; and 44 percent engaged in consumer activism by boycotting or deliberately buying a certain product for political, ethical, or environmental reasons (“buycotting”).

Many report having been involved with more confrontational forms of political engagement as well. About a third of Climate Strikers, or 32 percent, reported participating in confrontational direct action in the past year.

AD

Given these levels of civic engagement and political experience, expect these new voices to make themselves heard in the upcoming elections. If the election’s outcome is not what they hoped for, don’t be surprised if there's more climate action in the streets. Based on the direct action we saw during ShutDownDC on Monday and Friday, as well as the other civil disobedience that took place around the U.S. this past week, these climate activists are willing to act.

AD

And if peaceful protest and political participation do not work, they still have other options.

State attorneys generals have always worked cooperatively in major litigation against private firms, as they are doing against pharmaceutical companies in the opioid crisis — and as they have done against the tobacco companies, lenders after the financial crisis and in all sorts of consumer protection cases. “What happened and what you saw after the 2016 election was the emergence of a group of AG’s,"" she explained. ""It is highly unusual to find ourselves at a time having to take on the federal government, to stand up for the rule of law, protect democracy, protect people’s rights.”

“The courts have been allies in the fight to restrain Trump’s agenda,"" she said. ""The courts have really been the place we’ve gone to toe the line on some of these illegal and unconstitutional actions.” She and the other attorneys general have been quite successful in bringing suits, usually with requests for preliminary injunctions. “It is critically important we had this branch to go to stop abuses by the executive branch,” she said. Multiple iterations of the Muslim travel ban and environmental regulations were stopped by states’ actions in court.

While it is “too soon” to tell the impact of Trump-appointed judges, the rate of confirmations and the spotty qualifications of some remain a long-term concerns. In this context, Healey credits the role of state courts, laws and constitutions that can retain rights and protections when the federal government rolls back.

On health care, Massachusetts and other states have multiple actions pending around the country seeking to preserve the Affordable Care Act and/or stop administration efforts to undermine or whittle away the protections in the law. On a more basic level, she finds the administration’s conduct on health care extraordinary. Healey explains, “The Republicans have tried to take away healthcare how many times? 97 times? 100 times? You saw the American people come forward to say, ‘Don’t take away our healthcare.’ "" Nevertheless, the Trump administration continues court actions to obliterate the ACA and slash Medicaid. “What you see is Democratic AG’s stepping into the fore,” she said. Healey also said she hopes for “more sensible policy making” and an end to efforts to take away what they cannot take away through legislation.

Massachusetts has joined California and other states in seeking to maintain the waivers that California gets (and other states sign onto) to allow higher air-quality standards than the federal government requires. The feds now want that to end, and to reverse progress made in various states with the full cooperation of the auto companies. “It’s stupid policy. It’s stupid economically and it’s really morally reprehensible,” Healey says. She finds the administration’s response — suing the auto companies for cooperatively keeping air-quality standards high — a ridiculous use of resources.

I asked Healey about the scandal enveloping the White House and Justice Department. Healey says she finds it “very troubling, very disturbing and [I] think it should be a significant cause of concern for any American.” She reiterates that the attorney general is the people’s lawyer, not Trump’s personal lawyer and yet, time and again, it has been Trump’s personal interests that have prevailed. Healey says it is “incredibly concerning” that so many lawyers at Justice Department, the White House and elsewhere seem to have been involved or at least have been mute. “And it’s not just within the White House DOJ,” she said. “But look what’s happening in the Congress, too. Any number of those senators are lawyers themselves or have lawyers working for them and yet for them to continue to turn a blind eye to an administration that does not respect the rule of law. . . .”

Healey worries that corrupt conduct gets normalized. “I did it, so what?” seems to be the new defense, she observed. “We need a time out and a reset about what is right and what is wrong.” She fears we have gone “astray” and rather than adhere to our constitutional traditions we are “replicating authoritarian regimes.”

If Warren does win the presidency, it’s quite possible that Healey will occupy a prominent role, or perhaps try to run to replace Warren as senator. I asked Healey whether she thought Republican Gov. Charlie Baker would, in that event, have an obligation to appoint a Democrat on a temporary basis. For the first time during the interview, she replied briskly: “No comment.” For now, she’s a principal legal antagonist of the administration and an enthusiastic Warren supporter. Remember her name, however. I’m quite certain that Massachusetts attorney general will not be the highest office she holds.

Less funny, anonymity also has largely defined Klobuchar’s role in the Democratic presidential contest — even though she has been a senator from Minnesota for 12 years and serves in leadership, even though she passes more legislation each session than most Democrats, even though she’s regularly on cable news and is campaigning across the country.

At the beginning of the latest Democratic debate earlier this month, Klobuchar — who was stationed at the last lectern on the far left of the stage — embraced reality.

“I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we’ve already got that in the White House,” she said, adding, “If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you’ve got a home with me.”

The question for her campaign: In a primary driven by more combative activists, how many voters want that? And why her over other centrist candidates?

Klobuchar has seen a small bump in some polls since that debate, delighting her and her staff. A September Focus on Rural America poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers found her support at 8 percent, and a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll released last weekend put her at 3 percent. Yet an average of national polls in September showed Klobuchar’s support around 1 percent.

AD

She’s leaning on the fact that most voters say their support is fluid. Yet, for months she’s been overshadowed in the center by former vice president Joe Biden, who, like her, contends he’s a champion of working-class Midwestern voters and union members and knows how to work with Republicans to get legislation passed. And she has no clear strategy for changing that.

While most Democratic candidates have publicly challenged Biden — questioning his age and his comments on racial issues, among other things — Klobuchar largely has refrained and has even come to Biden’s defense. When asked why she thinks she would have a better shot at winning Rust Belt states than Biden, who grew up in Pennsylvania, Klobuchar says that she is “actually from the Midwest,” is a woman and is “in a new generation of politicians.” (At 59, she is 17 years younger than Biden.)

“A generation that actually has governed during the Trump era, which I think is key,” she said during a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. “I was able to navigate this Congress during and before Donald Trump.”

Meanwhile, Klobuchar has repeatedly questioned and criticized policy ideas embraced by the two most prominent liberals in the race — Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — that she says are too costly and would be paid for by the already strapped middle class. That includes Medicare-for-all, which Klobuchar calls “a bad idea” that would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance plans, and making four-year colleges tuition free, which she says would force blue-collar workers to foot tuition bills of “rich kids.”

These sorts of ideas “are better left in the college faculty lounge,” Klobuchar said in Detroit last week — which sounded like a jab at Warren, a former law professor, although Klobuchar insisted it wasn’t. Klobuchar has said that although Warren has a plethora of plans, her own plans “have deadlines” and are more likely to be passed and implemented.

Via a small charter plane, Klobuchar recently took a whirlwind two-day trip through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three usually Democratic states that gave Trump the White House. During the trip, she made sure to note that in 2018 she won 42 Minnesota counties that voted for Trump two years earlier, when he came surprisingly close to winning her home state.

Klobuchar said that presidential candidates need to keep voters in these states in mind now — and that a more moderate candidate would have better success there during a general election.

During a visit to a carpentry-training center in Pittsburgh, Klobuchar often finished the sentences of her tour guides as they spoke of the dire need for welders and their frustration that some parents push their kids into four-year colleges when a trade school would be a better fit.

She said the government should double the amount of money given to students through Pell grants, increase the income cap to qualify for those grants and make one- and two-year-degree programs free.

“We are so focused sometimes on one path to success and that’s not everyone’s path to success, and we need to make it easier for students to go to programs like this,” she said.

The next day, she took artisanal doughnuts to United Auto Workers members striking outside a General Motors assembly factory in Detroit.

“I stand with you guys,” she told them. “You stood with the company when it was in trouble, right? Took a bunch of cuts, did things. And now the company is doing better, and you should share in that prosperity.”

Some responded positively.

“She said all the right things — which they do, but she seemed heartfelt and genuine, and you don’t usually get that from politicians,” said Meoshee Edwards, 47, who has worked at the plant for 23 years, likes Sanders and knew nothing about Klobuchar before she showed up. “She seems to know exactly what we’re fighting for and why we’re fighting for it. . . . I am going to research her now.”

But Klobuchar wasn’t warmly embraced everywhere. During a tour of a dairy farm in rural Wisconsin — home to a young calf named “Amy” in her honor — a few of the local farmers who had gathered to meet her were upset that she spent more time talking to the media than to them. Later that day, she stopped by a training session in Milwaukee to share her ideas for expanding voting access with a group of African American activists and take a few questions about her time as a prosecutor. As she took a photograph with the group, one man declined to be included because he said she hadn’t taken enough questions and hadn’t fully answered the questions she was asked.

AD

Throughout the trip, Klobuchar made clear that to her, being a moderate isn’t just about policy — it’s also about her tone and approach. That’s meant focusing on issues and legislation that Republicans are willing to work on, even if it doesn’t excite a lot of Democratic primary voters. It has meant remaining calm and collected while questioning Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. It has meant being the un-snazzy mom on the debate stage who scolds the others when they bicker.

“We need to not just change the policies in our country, but also change the tone of our politics,” Klobuchar said to cheers in a Milwaukee coffee shop last week.

AD

Sitting in the audience was Nancy Glissman, 59, who drove more than two hours with her husband from Illinois to be there. For many years, Glissman voted for Republicans for president but then voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. With Trump in office, she is now firmly a Democrat.

AD

“I think Amy could lead us out of this without being divisive to our country,” said Glissman, who is retired. “We need somebody strong, but somebody that everyone can trust and get around. I think she’s that kind of person.”

Glissman sat with Brenda Dourseau, 60, a retired corrections officer who said the party needs to focus on reconnecting with young voters such as her grandchildren — and she wasn’t sure whether Klobuchar was the person to do that.

AD

“We need a candidate that can really touch these millennials. If they can lead them and get them excited, then [baby boomers] are going to follow, because we know that we have to get Trump out of there,” she said. Democrats “need to go to the younger voters. They truly do.”

Tom Glissman, Nancy’s husband, said that he would give Klobuchar more consideration if she were doing better in the polls. He is leaning toward Warren — although he wishes she would abandon her calls for Medicare-for-all and instead embrace offering a public option, as Klobuchar has done.

AD

“I love Elizabeth Warren, I really do, but she’s just a little too far left,” Dourseau said. “With all of the fire in the belly she has — if she was a little more moderate, she would be a shoo-in.”

All three agreed that they would vote for any Democrat in the general election.

“I can’t wait until this nightmare is over,” Glissman said. “I can’t wait until this Trump presidency is over. I will sleep better.”

“Me, too,” Dourseau said. “It’s a mess. The country is a mess.”"

President Trump. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)

The congressional Republicans fiercely defending President Trump's conduct in a July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart are leaning on a legal technicality.

The president, they say, did nothing wrong by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate one of his chief 2020 rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, because he never framed the request as an explicit quid pro quo in exchange for military aid.

Critics say the argument is extremely tenuous: Any rational person reading the rough transcript of the call would understand Trump made clear Zelensky should open a probe to ensure the release of the $390 million aid package.

Yet Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), describing the threshold for a quid pro quo, suggested the president would have needed to say something like, “‘Uh, hey pal, you know, you need to like, go after the Bidens or I ain’t gonna give you any money.’ He’d be really, like, thuggish about it.”

Some election law experts say Graham has a point: Through a series of decisions over the past two decades, courts have raised the bar almost impossibly high for prosecutors seeking to prove public officials have traded their power for personal gain. The resulting dynamic undergirds Washington’s swamp economy — a system protecting the outsize influence of donors and lobbyists by allowing them to keep goodies flowing to policymakers, while ensuring those in power don’t face scrutiny for horse-trading.

“Quid pro quo being a high legal standard is a fair point,” says Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, “though the words in that phone call come a lot closer to proving quid pro quo than you see in a lot of cases.”

The case that began chipping away at the public corruption standard unfolded in the shadow of the last presidential impeachment. Two weeks before President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House in December 1998, a federal court acquitted his agriculture secretary, Mike Espy, of corruptly taking sports tickets and other lavish gifts from lobbyists for companies he regulated. Prosecutors said Espy accepted $34,000 worth of sports tickets, luggage and other lavish gifts from lobbyists. But the court found Espy hadn’t violated an illegal gratuities statute in doing so, because prosecutors failed to prove he took any official action in exchange.

“Going into that case, people thought this was pretty straightforward,” says the Brookings Institution’s Darrell West. “But what it revealed is that you have to demonstrate you got a benefit and you did something in return … Trump could easily defend himself by saying he just wanted to establish warm relations between the two countries, and he wasn't doing something in return for a campaign benefit.”

West said the Espy verdict had a chilling effect on public corruption cases. And decisions in subsequent cases further eroded the legal standard.

The U.S. Supreme Court has helped turn the tide. A 2010 ruling involving the former Enron executive Jeff Skilling, for example, narrowed the so-called honest-services fraud statute. “The court restricted the use of the provision to only the most egregious forms of fraud, such as bribery and kickbacks, disallowing the charge for grayer types of corporate malfeasance,” Jesse Eisinger writes in the book ""The Chicken**** Club.”

Bookbinder says while the decision was aimed primarily at corporate defendants, it had a spillover effect for public officials facing potential corruption charges, as well.

The high court in 2016 ripped some more pages from the prosecutors’ playbook by unanimously overturning the conviction on public corruption charges of Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell. The Republican had taken more than $175,000 in loans and gifts from a Richmond businessman who wanted state universities to test a dietary supplement his company had developed.

But as The Post’s Robert Barnes wrote at the time, the tests were never conducted and the gifts didn’t violate state law. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts reasoned, “There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that. But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government’s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.”

These laws are written, of course, by people subject to them. “They’re looking to protect themselves, and the laws have been interpreted very narrowly by the courts,” Bookbinder says. “Courts can be very sympathetic to public officials. Judges don't seem to like broad public corruption laws.”

Whether that stems from judicial philosophy or an interest in avoiding antagonizing another branch of government, the upshot has been good for the swamp. In the 20 years since the Espy decision, spending on federal lobbying alone has more than doubled, from $1.45 billion in 1998 to $3.46 billion last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

George Brown, one of the prosecutors in the Espy case who now teaches at the Boston College of Law, says in Trump’s case, “if I was a lawyer in the House, I would say even though I can't point to a statute, that doesn’t mean this is not grounds for impeachment… We don’t have a federal crime of ‘abuse of office.’ But this is an abuse of office.”

And Democrats who have now launched a formal impeachment inquiry don’t need to meet a legal standard to press ahead. The Constitution gives lawmakers wide latitude to determine what constitutes presidential “high crimes and misdemeanors.” And Trump may have broken the law anyway, since it is a crime to solicit a campaign contribution from a foreign citizen, and a foreign corruption probe aimed at a rival arguably constitutes an in-kind donation.

Trump and his defenders nevertheless continue emphasizing the lack of an explicit deal between the president and Zelensky. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted it:

❌ Myth: The President made a “promise” to Zelensky in return for reviving an investigation relating to Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.



✔️ Fact: There was no promise. The President wanted allegations of corruption potentially involving an American official to be investigated. — Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) September 26, 2019

The talking points the White House distributed to congressional Republicans — which they accidentally sent to Democratic offices, as well, before trying to recall them — led with the no-quid-pro-quo argument. And some top Republicans on the Hill are sticking with it:

Because he knows the transcript shows no quid pro quo or crimes.

MARKET MOVERS

— Jobless claims increase to three-week high: “Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits rose for a second week but remained near historically low levels, a sign the labor market remains broadly robust,” Bloomberg News’s Reade Pickert reports.

“Jobless claims rose 3,000 to a three-week high of 213,000 in the week ended Sept. 21, according to Labor Department figures released … that were about in line with estimates in Bloomberg's survey. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, fell to 212,000, the lowest since late July.”

Consumer confidence is also dropping: “U.S. consumer comfort fell for a third week as views of the buying climate dimmed to the weakest level since June, adding to signs consumer spending will moderate after the strongest quarter since 2014,” Bloomberg’s William Edwards reports. “The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index slipped to 61.7 in the week ended Sept. 22 from 62.7 the prior week, data released Thursday show. The buying gauge eased to 54.3 from 54.5 with views on personal finances and the national economy also posting declines.”

— Business investment drop-off was steeper than we thought. Reuters's Lucia Mutikani: ""U.S. business investment contracted more sharply than previously estimated in the second quarter and corporate profit growth was tepid, casting a shadow on an economy that is being stalked by financial market fears of a recession... The soft investment and sluggish profit gains, reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday, could raise doubts on consumers’ ability to continue driving the economy...

""Business investment declined at a 1.0% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its third reading of second-quarter gross domestic product. That was the steepest decline since the fourth quarter of 2015.""

— Housing gains are underwhelming: “The housing market is a bit better lately. But considering the overall economic environment, the improvement still counts as underwhelming,” the WSJ’s Justin Lahart reports.

“The National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending home sales — sales of previously owned homes that are under contract but haven’t been finalized — bounced back in August, putting it 2.5% above its year-earlier level. That follows … [the] Commerce Department report showing that new-home sales jumped last month and last week’s report that existing-home sales firmed in August.”

Putting the gains in perspective: “Combined new- and existing-home sales have gotten back only to where they were in the beginning of last year. And they are about level with where they were in 2000, when the U.S. population was significantly lower than it is now.”

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— U.S.-China talks set to resume next month: ""Trade talks between the U.S. and China are set to resume Oct. 10-11 in Washington, D.C., three people close to the talks told CNBC,"" CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Kayla Tausche reports. ""Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing the delegation from Beijing, one of the people told CNBC.""

""Liu visited Washington this spring sporting the title 'special envoy,' empowering him to negotiate on behalf of President Xi Jinping and pledge to buy American soybeans in the Oval Office with [Trump]. But Liu was stripped of that title on a subsequent trip, after hardliners within the Communist Party balked at some of the concessions to which he had agreed.""

Meanwhile, China says it is buying agriculture products: China says it has purchased “a ‘considerable’ amount of U.S. soybeans and pork ahead of the next round of trade talks in Washington,” CNBC’s Yun Li reports.

“Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press conference that the U.S. and China are maintaining ‘close communication’ in preparation for the negotiations next month. He confirmed China has resumed its purchase of American farm goods and said the tariffs on those orders will be exempted.”

— Lumber mills slash jobs amid trade war: “The big bet that U.S. hardwood lumber companies placed on China over the past two decades is collapsing,” the Wall Street Journal’s Austen Hufford reports.

“China was a savior of sorts for the industry after the financial crisis last decade. Customers there kept buying oak and ash boards in large quantities, while construction and furniture production fell in the U.S. Now, after Beijing placed retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on imports of lumber and other U.S. wood products, exports of hardwood lumber to China have fallen 40% this year.”

POCKET CHANGE

— Effects of GM strike start to spread: “The United Auto Workers strike at General Motors Co. is starting to take a toll on businesses throughout Michigan, creating a growing threat to the state’s already-slowing economy,” the WSJ’s Kris Maher reports.

“Michigan’s economy faces the greatest exposure from a prolonged strike, because it has about 15 GM manufacturing facilities employing tens of thousands of workers, more than any other state … The work stoppage had cost GM hourly workers and others in Michigan not working due to the strike a total of about $9.3 million a day in lost wages by the end of last week, according to the Anderson Economic Group. For the state, that meant about $400,000 in income-tax revenue a day.”

GM reverses decision on striking workers’ health care: The automaker said “it will pay for the health insurance of its striking hourly workers, reversing a decision to push the costs onto the United Auto Workers union,” Reuters’s Ben Klayman reports. “The UAW had accused GM of blindsiding them with the decision to drop coverage during the strike, and some workers had claimed they could not pay their medical bills as a result. The union seized on this issue to rally public and political support for the 48,000 striking workers.”

— Telsa stock jumps after Musk’s comments: “Shares of Tesla jumped more than 5% after Electrek, an electric vehicle news website, reported that CEO Elon Musk said the company ‘has a shot’ at delivering 100,000 cars this quarter, which would be a new record,” CNBC’s Jasmine Kim reports.

“Electrek attributed the update to a leaked email from Musk sent to his employees at Tesla. Musk wrote in the email: ‘We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter, which is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company!’ ”

— WeWork’s CEO voted to oust himself: “When WeWork’s directors voted on Tuesday to oust Adam Neumann as chief executive after a failed attempt to take the office-sharing startup public, Neumann cast his vote against himself, according to three people familiar with the situation,” Reuters’s Joshua Franklin, Anirban Sen and Koh Gui Qing report.

“The vote by Neumann, who remains non-executive chairman but gave up majority control of the company he co-founded, was the culmination of a stunning coup to remove him led by his biggest backer, Masayoshi Son, the billionaire CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, these sources said.”

— Senate passes stopgap spending bill: ""The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill ... to keep the government open through Nov. 21, punting tough decisions about [Trump’s] border wall and other funding disputes until just before Thanksgiving,"" my colleague Erica Werner reports.

""The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it.""

What's next: ""The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020. The bipartisan vote on the spending measure came despite a Capitol in chaos over House Democrats’ new impeachment inquiry of Trump and a whistleblower complaint against Trump related to a call he had with the president of Ukraine.""

2020 WATCH:

— Wall Street Democrats warn they'll boycott if Warren wins nod. CNBC's Brian Schwartz: ""Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race.""

The quotes:

A ""senior private equity executive"": ""You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump.’”

An ""executive at one of the nation's largest banks,"" on hedge fund and bank executives: ""They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry.""

A ""hedge fund executive"": ""I think if she can show that the tax code of 2017 was basically nonsense and only helped corporations, Wall Street would not like the public thinking about that.""

Warren responds:

I'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process.

Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals.""

The backdrop: Record-high income inequality. The Post's Taylor Telford: ""Income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it more than five decades ago, according to data released Thursday, even as the nation’s poverty and unemployment rates are at historic lows. The gulf is starkest in wealthy regions along both coasts such as New York, Connecticut, California and Washington, D.C., as well as in areas with widespread poverty, such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Equality was highest in Utah, Alaska and Iowa.

""And while the nation is in the midst of its longest economic expansion, nine states saw spikes in inequality from 2017 to 2018: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia.""

— SEC finalizes rule to encourage IPOs. Reuters's Katanga Johnson: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday finalized a new rule that allows all companies to privately sound out prospective investors before filing for a stock exchange listing. The so-called 'testing-the-waters' rule, which currently only applies to smaller firms preparing to go public, will now be extended to all prospective issuers hoping to gauge broader market interest before filing registration statements for initial public offerings, the SEC said.

""The move, which the agency’s commissioners unanimously voted to approve on Wednesday, is part of a broader push by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to make it easier for companies to go public, amid worries that a 50 percent decline in U.S. listings over the past two decades is hurting investors.""

The context: Big-ticket IPOs have been a big disappointment this year, as the NYT's Matt Phillips, Stephen Grocer and Erin Griffith report: ""This was supposed to be the year when America’s biggest start-ups would finally make their triumphant debut on the stock market. Billionaire Silicon Valley investors, sneaker-clad founders and button-down bankers all expected enormous stock sales to turn companies like Uber, Lyft and WeWork into a new generation of corporate giants.

""It hasn’t quite turned out that way. Last week, WeWork postponed its planned initial public offering. Uber and Lyft sold shares earlier this year only to see their prices collapse. Investors took a look and backed away, seeing overpriced companies with no prospect of making money any time soon, in some cases led by untested executives. On Thursday, Peloton joined the list with a disappointing first day of trading.""

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has run a marvelous campaign and is whip-smart, yet she foolishly ducks the most obvious question: Will taxes go up on middle-class people to pay for Medicare-for-all? Her evasiveness not only convinces people that the answer is yes, but undermines her brand as a truth-talking populist who thinks we need government to do big, important things. Advice: Stop. Look how shady you look trying to duck and weave. Ignore the consultants telling you not to admit you would raise taxes. Put out a plan (you should have your own), and show voters the math. Trust them to see it is a good deal for them, if that is what you believe.

Among the many administration figures reportedly involved in the Ukraine fiasco and the coverup, some were enablers, furthering the scheme by delivering messages or taking overt action (e.g. stopping aid to Ukraine). Others are merely silent bystanders, convinced that if they keep their heads down and let braver colleagues tell the story, they would escape with their reputations and law licenses intact. They cannot, it seems, conceive that this president is collapsing. Whether by the next president, law enforcement or Congress, every detail and crevice of this story will be exposed. In some cases, there will be a fine line between passivity and conspiracy. Advice: Stop. Your tenure in the White House is over. Don’t lose your career, your law license or your liberty on the bet that you can escape notice. Look how quickly the story moves and how many others are already leaking, perhaps in ways designed to deflect blame from them onto you. Resign swiftly, go to the House Intelligence Committee and share what you know. The fear of discovery and of liability that now haunts you will dissipate.

To be certain, the Sean Hannitys and Breitbarts are never going to acknowledge the reality that the president they have boosted and defended is deeply unwell and betrayed his office. They truly are hopeless. But what about members of the pundit class, those who used to be seen as “gatekeepers” for the right, who carried the “But Gorsuch…” or “But taxes…” rationale for supporting the Trump presidency? They think their careers and friendships depend on keeping up with the act of ignoring, deflecting, topic-switching and attacking the messengers (the real media). But at some point, the better-than-average pundit class will find itself in a world in which “respectable” conservatives insist all along that they opposed President Trump. The mob will have moved onto a new hero and figured out that Trump must be repudiated as a crank, an abuser of power and a narcissistic fool in order to rescue the causes of right-wing nativism, elite resentment and bigotry that fund the right-wing ecosphere. Advice: Stop. Read the whistleblower complaint and the transcript, a couple of times if needed. Cease playing dumb about the severity of Trump’s actions. This is a man who threatened the whistleblower with harm. If you really believe in the reasons you supported Trump (tax cuts, judges, a hard line on immigration), understand that those causes will be forever tainted unless they can be divorced from Trump. Blame Trump’s feckless lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani if you like, but urge Senate Republicans to put an end to this debacle with a strong showing that they are willing to impeach.

The hardest thing to do is to give up the perspectives that prevent one from recognizing reality and thereby adjusting to it. Failure to do so has profoundly dangerous consequences.

They tested an array of voting machines and election systems that states plan to use in the next election -- and were able to crack into every machine they got their hands on.

Lawmakers seeking to get more election security funding embraced their findings -- and promised to spread the results of their work to scare every sitting member about the political risks of weak security.

“The best way we can make the case is by scaring the living bejesus out of every member of Congress that the system can be fixed against them,” said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.).

The ethical hackers' tests, which took place this summer at the Def Con cybersecurity conference's ""Voting Village,"" could easily be replicated by voters, poll workers, or anyone else with access to the machines, said Matt Blaze, a co-founder of the election testing project and a Georgetown University cryptography professor. And in some cases, he said, hackers could probably compromise the machines even if they weren’t anywhere near them — especially if poll workers made mistakes setting them up or took shortcuts.

All it took was a few days of tinkering on machines they mostly bought on eBay. “The resources of…eBay are well within that of our foreign adversaries,” Blaze warned.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a major booster for election security funding, said the tests prove “it is basically a piece of cake for a relatively savvy hacker to compromise an election and alter votes.""

But the wide variety of serious flaws these hackers found, ranging from weak default passwords to shoddy encryption, underscores just how little time states have to make fixes by 2020. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is blocking bills that would mandate key election security fixes recommended by Blaze and other security experts in exchange for cash.

“As of today, my view is that hostile foreign powers — and I’m not talking just about the Russians — are going to interfere in the 2020 election in a way that’s going to make what happened in 2016 look like small potatoes,” Wyden said.

Intelligence officials are also warning that Russian hackers who probed voting machines and hacked into voter databases in 2016 could do far worse next time, and other nations may be eager to follow suit. During a hearing yesterday focused on the landmark whistleblower complaint against President Trump, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire warned that cyberattacks and election interference are the “greatest challenge” the intelligence community faces, declaring ""this is cyberwar.""

Blaze and his co-founder Harri Hursti, founding partner of Nordic Innovation Labs, are urging Congress to require states to use paper ballots whenever possible and to conduct post-election security audits.

McConnell recently endorsed delivering an additional $250 million in federal money to state election officials but that's far lower than the $600 million Democrats in the Senate and House are pressing for -- and it doesn't include any mandates about how states must spend the money.

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

President Trump. (Erin Scott/Reuters)

PINGED: The computer system where officials stored the rough transcript of a conversation between President Trump and the leader of Ukraine is considered the White House's most secure lockbox. That's why it's highly unusual that a conversation containing no apparent highly classified information got stored there, several former officials from both the Obama and Trump administrations tell the Wall Street Journal's Warren P. Strobel and Andrew Restuccia. The “code word” computer system described in the whistleblower complaint is typically reserved for documents about U.S. covert actions and counterintelligence probes to root out moles and even most top White House national-security aides don't have access to it, the Journal reports

The high level of security would be extreme for a presidential phone call and suggests that the White House was concerned about political damage rather than national security, former National Security Council advisers told Jason Koebler and Joseph Cox at Motherboard.

“You don't have hundreds of people getting access to presidential calls. They're tightly controlled, so … to take the added step of telling the White House lawyers to put this on that system is beyond bizarre to me,” Kelly Magsamen, who served in the National Security Council for two administrations, told Motherboard. “It suggests they know it was extremely damaging.”

PATCHED: The Navy has appointed a new head cybersecurity official following a damning internal audit that found the branch had been hit with repeated national security-threatening compromises that jeopardized state secrets, Gordon Lubold and Dustin Volz at the Wall Street Journal report. Aaron Weis, a former cybersecurity adviser to the Pentagon, will lead the Navy's efforts to improve its cybersecurity standards and to create a stronger defense against increasingly aggressive Chinese hackers, Gordon and Dustin report.

One key focus for Weis will be tightening cybersecurity standards for defense contractors, a major target of foreign hackers. Navy officials expect to roll out a plan for more changes later this year, the Journal reported. The officials declined to discuss specific breaches with the Journal, but in one instance last year Chinese hackers reportedly managed to access plans for a supersonic missile after targeting a small contractor.

PWNED: An ""unauthorized third party"" breached the personal data of nearly 5 million DoorDash consumers, contractors, and merchants in May, the company revealed in a blog post yesterday.

The breach included the victims' names, addresses and phone numbers and also captured the driver's license numbers for 100,000 contractors. The incident, which comes just a year after DoorDash denied reports of a separate breach, could trigger fines under certain state data breach laws.

The company said it only noticed the “unusual activity"" which invovled a third-party service provider earlier this month and immediately blocked the user. Since then, DoorDash has added additional security protections and brought in an outside expert to assess its systems, the company said.

The breach affected only users who joined DoorDash before April 5, 2018, according to the company. The breach also exposed the last four digits of payment cards for consumers and the last four digits of bank account numbers for contractors and merchants.

New York's attorney general is suing doughnut company Dunkin' Brands for “glazing over” the fact that a 2015 hack compromised the accounts of nearly 20,000 customers, resulting in the theft of tens of thousands of dollars stored on users' store cards, the office said in a press release.

The company also failed to investigate the attacks to determine if additional accounts were compromised, the lawsuit claims. The company's failure to address cybersecurity concerns resulted in a second breach of more than 300,000 customers in 2018, which also compromised users' emails and card value, the suit claims. Dunkin' disclosed the 2018 attack to customers, but didn't reveal that hackers had actually accessed those customer accounts, the lawsuit claims.

“Dunkin’ failed to protect the security of its customers,” said Attorney General Letitia James. “And instead of notifying the tens of thousands impacted by these cybersecurity breaches, Dunkin’ sat idly by, putting customers at risk “ The lawsuit is seeking full restitution for the customers, civil penalties and changes to the company's business practices.

The whistleblower who sounded an alarm while others bit their tongues showed that. So did the inspector general who alerted Congress to his complaint when President Trump’s loyalists were trying to keep it secret. And the public got a glimpse during a House committee hearing on Thursday of how differently this scandal might have played out if Trump's previous pick to lead the nation’s intelligence community had been confirmed.

The temperamental contrast was stark between Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), the hyper-partisan congressman who wanted the job, and Joe Maguire, the decorated military hero who got it instead and seemed eager to show he’s no one’s toady. Democrats faulted Maguire, as the acting director of national intelligence, for checking in with the very entities who a CIA whistleblower had accused of wrongdoing, including Bill Barr’s Justice Department and Trump’s White House counsel’s office, to see if they wanted to claim executive privilege to prevent the disclosure of his allegations.

Maguire noted earnestly that he was new in the role and wanted to do the right thing. The retired admiral had been running the National Counterterrorism Center after 36 years in the Navy, including as commander of Seal Team 6. He said he’s sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution 11 times. “No one can take an individual’s integrity away,” Maguire explained. “It can only be given away.”

Ratcliffe’s questioning of Maguire – which was more of a monologue, really – offered a window into how he might have handled both the complaint and the hearing if he’d found himself in the hot seat. The congressman made the case that Trump prodding his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was “lawful conduct.” He claimed without evidence that the whistleblower was “wrong in numerous respects” and dubiously compared the complaint to the “Steele dossier” in the Russia investigation. “The United States is allowed to solicit help from a foreign government in an ongoing criminal investigation, which is exactly what President Trump did in that conversation,” Ratcliffe declared.

Ratcliffe’s hopes of getting formally nominated went down in flames on Aug. 2 after Senate Republicans expressed concern about his qualifications and evidence that he had padded his résumé. The three-term congressman had impressed Trump in July with his hostile questioning of former special counsel Bob Mueller. When the president pulled his support just a week after announcing his intention to nominate Ratcliffe, reporters asked Trump why he put someone with such limited national security experience up for such an important job without fully vetting him. “I think he would’ve picked it up very quickly,” Trump replied. “I give out a name to the press and they vet for me. We save a lot of money that way.” Trump gave the job instead to Maguire, who had no idea he’d immediately be thrust into the center of an epic fight between the White House and Congress.

During the hearing, Ratcliffe also falsely insisted that the legal opinion from the Justice Department, which claimed that intelligence community officials didn’t need to turn over the whistleblower complaint because it was outside of their jurisdiction, was written by nonpolitical lawyers. “That's an opinion from the Department of Justice ethics lawyers – not political appointees, but career officials that serve Republicans and Democrats,” Ratcliffe said during the hearing.

In fact, that opinion – released publicly on Wednesday – was authored by Trump appointee Steven Engel. Engel earned a reputation as a highly partisan figure in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, which is why Democrats fought his confirmation to run the Office of Legal Counsel. He was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 47 in November 2017. As a former U.S. attorney, it seems inconceivable that Ratcliffe would not know the Office of Legal Counsel is led by a political appointee.

-- It’s also very revealing to contrast how Maguire and Trump talked about the whistleblower. The acting DNI testified that he does not know who wrote the document, but he said he doesn’t question the person’s motives. He added that he believes they “acted in good faith” and insisted that he is glad the information has finally come out. “I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” Maguire said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

As Maguire was testifying, Trump declared that the whistleblower acted like “a spy” and suggested that the legally protected conduct was akin to “treason.” Speaking in New York at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, the president made clear that he’d also like to ferret out anyone else who provided evidence of his misconduct. “I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistleblower … the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

The Los Angeles Times published an audio recording of the closed-door speech, and The Post later obtained a video. “We’re at war,” Trump said in his ad-libbed remarks, referring to the scandal. “These people are sick. They’re sick. And nobody’s called it out like I do.”

-- Trump and his band of brothers have been leaning on the language of war this week. Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, congratulated Democrats at the Maguire hearing on the “rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.”

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House strategist, compared Nancy Pelosi’s speech on Tuesday night to the start of the Civil War in 1861. “Pelosi’s announcement to begin a formal process at 5 p.m. was the shot at Fort Sumter,” Bannon said. “Now you cannot freelance, you cannot go rogue. You have to be disciplined. You have to be high and tight.”

-- Former DNI James Clapper likened the president’s comments about the whistleblower to “witness retaliation.” “What’s really bad about it is this is going to have a very chilling effect on any other potential whistleblowers,” the Trump critic said on CNN.

WHAT’S EMERGED ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER:

-- “The whistleblower’s identity remains obscured, the details of his work for the CIA cloaked in secrecy. But the document he delivered reveals almost as much about the investigative mission he carried out in stealth as it does about the alleged abuses of power by the president,” Greg Miller reports. “[T]he CIA officer behind the whistleblower report moved swiftly behind the scenes to assemble material from at least a half-dozen highly placed — and equally dismayed — U.S. officials. He wove their accounts with other painstakingly gathered material on everything from the intervention of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage. …

“Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what [Mueller] accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment. ‘In the course of my official duties,’ the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that ‘the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.’”

-- The White House learned that a CIA officer had lodged allegations about Trump’s call even as the officer’s whistleblower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, the New York Times reports: “The officer first shared information about potential abuse of power and a White House cover-up with the C.I.A.’s top lawyer through an anonymous process … The lawyer shared the officer’s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. … But as White House, C.I.A. and Justice Department officials were examining the accusations, the C.I.A. officer who had lodged them anonymously grew concerned after learning that [CIA general counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood] had contacted the White House … While it is not clear how the officer became aware that Ms. Elwood had shared the information, he concluded that the C.I.A. was not taking his allegations seriously.”

“The whistle-blower was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity, and has since returned to the C.I.A.,” per Julian Barnes, Michael Schmidt, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner in the Times. “His complaint suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.”

-- The AP also reports that White House and the Justice Department learned about a CIA officer’s concerns about Trump “around the same time the individual filed a whistleblower complaint.” Eric Tucker, Michael Balsamo and Zeke Miller say that information about the whistleblower was already making its way through the administration:

“On Aug. 14, White House counsel John Eisenberg and a CIA official alerted the head of DOJ’s national security division about the original complaint to the CIA. John Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call. He then alerted people within the Justice Department, but it was unclear specifically who he told. In the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community’s inspector general about a whistleblower complaint.”

-- Responding to reader criticism, Times executive editor Dean Baquet defended their decision to publish information about the whistleblower and noted that the White House already knew he was a CIA officer. “We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower — including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House — because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible,” Baquet wrote. “The role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the U.S. abused power and whether the W.H. covered it up.”

-- The whistleblower emphasized in the complaint that he was not the only one worried. “The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,” he wrote in his complaint. “They told me there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

NEW DETAILS ON WHAT RUDY WAS UP TO:

-- Giuliani spent months cultivating relationships with five current and former prosecutors in Ukraine to achieve a particular goal: Helping Trump win next year’s election by pursuing allegations damaging to his Democratic rivals. Paul Sonne, Michael Birnbaum, Rosalind S. Helderman and Josh Dawsey report: “Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family. ... During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election. … Some of the Ukrainians Giuliani and his associates interacted with were banned from entering the United States. Giuliani blamed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for blocking the officials from coming to the United States to give him more information. … A former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers — and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.”

-- A former top Ukraine prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of Giuliani’s dirt-digging effort, said Hunter Biden “did not violate anything.” Michael Birnbaum, David L. Stern and Natalie Gryvnyak report: “‘From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,’ former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of [the whistleblower's complaint] … ‘Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,’ Lutsenko said. Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year. Lutsenko said that Giuliani tried to arrange a meeting with him two times before they finally managed to connect on the third try in January, ‘I took a vacation. I took my youngest son, I showed him New York and I met with Mr. Giuliani,’ Lutsenko said. ‘I had a long conversation with him. But this was only in the forum of exchanging information.’

""Lutsenko met with Giuliani again in Warsaw in mid-February, then for a third and final time ‘in Europe,’ he said, refusing to be more specific. Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws. But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.”

-- One of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's political rivals in Kiev is demanding that he release the government's transcript of the call, as Zelensky finds himself in hot water across Europe for his criticisms of the French and Germans. Siobhán O’Grady and Rick Noack report: “In a Facebook post, [Ukrainian opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko] called it ‘strange that the [Ukrainian] President’s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House.’ … [In the call, Zelensky] praised Trump and went on to say he met both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron and told them: ‘They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.’ Those comments were not well received in Europe. ‘To say that I consider this to be incomprehensible would perhaps be a mild way to put it,’ [said] Elmar Brok, who was recently appointed special adviser on Ukraine for outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.”

-- Conservative columnist John Solomon, executive vice president of the Hill newspaper, helped craft the flawed Ukraine narrative that would later be echoed by Trump, his son Don Jr., and Giuliani. Paul Farhi reports: “Back in March, the Hill newspaper published a series of stories and interviews that seemed, at the time, to be mainly of interest to foreign-policy wonks. [Solomon] interviewed Ukraine’s then-top prosecutor, [Lutsenko], who alleged a startling conspiracy: that law enforcement officials within his country had leaked damaging information in 2016 against Paul Manafort ... to help ... Clinton’s presidential campaign. … The story touched off a brushfire within the conservative media, in which Solomon is a prominent figure, but stayed largely out of mainstream view. On Thursday, however, Solomon’s work gained new attention — and raised new questions about its sourcing, credibility and motivation. In [the whistleblower's complaint], Solomon’s stories were cited as part of a narrative about the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine’s government into digging up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rivals.”

-- Trump appears to be counting on confusion over the complex Ukraine story to offer a fog of false claims and allegations to make it appear Joe Biden did something wrong. The Post’s Fact Checker team published a short guide this morning to Trump’s statements — and the truth.

-- And Philip Bump created a helpful timeline of the significant dates in the whistleblower’s complaint to provide more clarity on how Trump's and Giuliani’s efforts to get dirt on Biden unfolded.

CASCADING FALLOUT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE:

-- Vice President Pence is trying to dodge the impeachment spotlight, but his Ukraine moves are attracting notice. Toluse Olorunnipa and Ashley Parker report: “Pence did not participate in [the July call] … But Pence’s name has emerged in several other contexts … The whistleblower complaint … said Pence canceled a planned trip to Ukraine at the direction of Trump, who was seeking to pressure the Ukrainians to help him politically. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed that Pence’s attendance had been requested at Zelensky’s inauguration and that his office had looked at dates for a visit to Kiev. … The vice president’s Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky, and his discussions with Trump, will be key targets for House Democrats … Pence told reporters after the meeting that he had not discussed Biden with Zelensky but said that he had relayed Trump’s ‘great concerns about issues of corruption.’”

-- “The White House has taken extraordinary steps over the past two years to block details of Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders from becoming public. Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report: “The number of aides allowed to listen on secure ‘drop’ lines was slashed. The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call’s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with ‘EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.’ And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak … At one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials. …

“The complaint said the transcript was ‘loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive level.’ According to the whistleblower, ‘one White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.’ … The July 25 call had roughly 12 to 13 people listening in. … Once the call concluded and copies were distributed to top officials in the White House, lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office then directed that the document be moved to a code-word-protected secure computer network that is normally reserved for transcripts that contain national security secrets after officials raised concerns about Trump’s comments, according to the complaint.”

-- Lost in the controversy over Trump’s phone call is Zelensky's effort to curry favor with the president through his private business. Jonathan O’Connell and David Fahrenthold report: “‘Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,’ Zelensky told Trump [according to the transcript of their July 25 call] ... Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him abut it. … It remains unclear whether the stays were illegal. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.""

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced impeachment investigation that could lead to a vote around Thanksgiving. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as [Pelosi] is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-line’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’ Inside the room, the group urged the leadership to keep the messaging around impeachment on national security and the Ukraine probe being led by the House Intelligence Committee…

“Some senior Democrats are even arguing that other committees should forgo potentially explosive hearings that could distract from the intelligence panel’s work … ‘Very few hearings, if any,’ said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. … But many of the moderate freshmen do not want to be seen as rushing to conclusions — whether on the Ukraine probe or any other aspect of potential presidential wrongdoing. … A senior Democratic aide familiar with discussions among the party’s moderate wing relayed concerns that a probe seen as moving too rapidly by the public could backfire. …

“One of the first credible polls to test the Democratic impeachment push following Pelosi’s Tuesday announcement found the public almost evenly split. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist Poll conducted Wednesday found Americans approving 49 percent to 46 percent of the House inquiry, with independents disapproving 50 percent to 44 percent.""

-- Pelosi explained to the New Yorker that impeaching Trump for “bad behavior” isn’t worth it. The difference now is the president, she contends, is undermining democracy and the electoral system. David Remnick writes up his interview: “When I asked Pelosi if she thought Trump knows, in this instance or any other, the difference between right and wrong, she replied, ‘He knows the difference between right and wrong, but I don’t know that he really cares. I do think his categorical imperative is what’s good is what is right for him. In the campaign, he told us who he was. He said that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care, that his supporters wouldn’t care. Well, he could violate our Constitution, the integrity of our elections, and dishonor his oath of office, as he did in this call, and think that nobody cares.’”

-- She’s back: Hillary Clinton is doing a media tour to express support for impeachment, starting with CBS and continuing with additional TV sit-downs next week. The former secretary of state called the man who beat her in 2016 a “corrupt human tornado” and an “illegitimate president.” HRC’s appearances probably aren’t helpful to the Democratic cause and make it look like they’re trying to relitigate the 2016 campaign.

-- Trump is writing the Republican playbook on impeachment, and he’s going with a scorched-earth strategy. Will it work? Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report: “Trump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid. And in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump’s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it. … Trump’s advisers said they envision a ‘split screen’ strategy in the coming weeks. The president is considering stepping up his fall schedule of campaign rallies at arenas across the country to galvanize his supporters outside of Washington and portray House Democrats as liberal insiders who are focused on impeachment instead of governing.”

-- Politico co-founder John Harris, who covered Bill Clinton’s impeachment for The Post, remembers that impeachment proceedings used to be news of unquestionable gravity: “The week showed it's just more fodder for the ideological and culture wars.”

THE (FEW) REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS:

-- Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker endorsed an impeachment inquiry of Trump, joining fellow Republican governor Phil Scott of Vermont. ""It’s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it,” Baker told reporters in the Bay State. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s office did not respond to requests for comment, per Reis Thebault.

-- Former Republican senator Jeff Flake said “at least 35” GOP senators would privately vote for Trump’s impeachment. The Arizonan, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, was responding to veteran Republican political consultant Mike Murphy's suggestion on MSNBC that 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump if it was “a secret vote.” “That’s not true,” Flake said in Texas. “There would be at least 35.” (Fox News)

-- The president's leading advisers are concerned about the ""threat"" posed by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and are ""trying to isolate him,"" Jonathan Martin reports in the Times: ""Mr. Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. … To Mr. Romney, who represents a state where he is beloved and is unlikely to seek another office, it is a moment where he believes country should trump party. ‘Each person should search their own heart and do what they think is right, which is just what I do,’ he said. … Mr. Romney said he was not attempting to steer a party he believes is overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s grip. But as Mr. Romney contemplates what he acknowledges will likely be his last period of public service, his friends say he is appalled by what he sees as the president’s win-at-all-costs immorality and his party’s willingness to remain quiet in the face of such misconduct.”

-- “Because Trump tests boundaries of morality and legality, his defenders are, in effect, calling on Americans to ratify those changes,” writes Michael Gerson, who served as chief speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House. “By all the evidence, Trump believes that politics, stripped of pretense, is the dirty, unethical pursuit of power, which is properly used to destroy your enemies. Republicans who defend or excuse him are providing permission for his radical redesign of public life. This is perhaps the saddest result of Trump’s corruption: turning good men and women into the bodyguards of a petty, cruel, lawless, would-be autocrat. Because Trump has chosen to be transparently corrupt, congressional Republicans cannot dispute the facts of the case (as they did during [Mueller’s] investigation). They may still insist: No quid pro quo. But this is more of a rally chant than an argument.”

Gerson, a Trump critic, believes impeachment has become inevitable: “Impeachment may be inadvisable. It may apply a cheese grater to the nation’s partisan wounds. The process may be conducted foolishly. It may feed a Republican thirst for revenge against a future Democratic president. It may motivate Trump’s base to salivating enthusiasm. The broad, American middle may yawn and switch to ESPN. All of this matters, especially if it increases the chances of Trump’s reelection. But it matters like a fate, not like a choice.”

A RANGE OF VOICES FROM THE POST'S OPINION PAGE:

-- The whistleblower complaint strengthens the case that Trump offered Ukraine’s president a quid pro quo, inveighs the Editorial Board.

-- We sent aid to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's ongoing occupation. By holding back American support, Trump helped Putin, writes Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Obama administration.

-- Trump’s impeachment need not be a long, drawn-out affair, writes liberal Eugene Robinson: “The nation has suffered this small, foolish, dangerous man long enough. Pelosi should damn the torpedoes and move full speed ahead.”

-- The whistleblower complaint doesn’t do the Democrats any favors, argues conservative Henry Olsen: “It offers little new information not already in the public domain. Furthermore, if it continues to be relied upon as evidence justifying impeachment, Democrats will have to make some hard choices about how to proceed.”

-- Democrats are sprinting ahead of the evidence, adds conservative Marc Thiessen, another former Bush speechwriter.

­-- The whistleblower and the vulnerable Democratic freshmen who backed an impeachment inquiry are profiles in courage, writes conservative Max Boot: “This week reminds us that there are some people in Washington who are not motivated solely by self-interest — that there are actually a few people in positions of public responsibility who care about the Constitution and are willing to run considerable risks to protect it.”

-- Americans have already seen enough for three articles of impeachment, argues Jennifer Rubin, a lawyer by training.

-- As alarming as the allegations are against Trump, impeachment is still not required, writes Princeton University professor Keith Whittington: “The House would not necessarily be failing to do its ‘constitutional duty’ if it did not pass articles of impeachment.”

Refugees gather in front of the White House. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Trump administration slashed the number of refugees who will be admitted to the U.S. next year to a historic low of 18,000. David Nakamura, Maria Sacchetti and Seung Min Kim report: “The new limit represents a 40 percent drop from the 2019 cap and marks the third consecutive year that the administration has slashed the program since the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in President Barack Obama’s final year in office. In addition, the Trump administration announced an executive order aimed at allowing local jurisdictions more leeway in rejecting refugees who are being resettled across the country, although experts said such powers are less relevant at a time when the number of refugees being admitted has dwindled sharply.""

A breakdown of who is being let in: ""Under the plan for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, the administration would allocate 5,000 refugee slots to people fleeing for religious reasons, 4,000 for Iraqis who assisted the United States and fall under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, and 1,500 for nationals of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to senior administration officials. Another 7,500 slots would go to refugees not covered by these categories, including those referred to the program by U.S. embassies. Last year’s cap of 30,000 divided slots by region, including 11,000 refugees from Africa, the largest group, administration officials said. Latin America and the Caribbean had 3,000 slots last year.”

-- Matthew Albence, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, once again took aim at “sanctuary cities” that refuse to help the feds deport undocumented immigrants. This time, he did so from the podium in the White House briefing room. Maria Sacchetti reports: “Albence criticized jurisdictions in several states after the agency arrested nearly 1,300 migrants during the past week via Operation Cross Check, a recurring immigration roundup of people convicted of crimes that include murder, manslaughter and child abuse. Nearly 200 of those arrested could have been taken into custody in a state prison or a local jail, he said. Instead, they were released after posting bail or at the end of their sentences, forcing ICE agents to track them down. … Albence was flanked by sheriffs from Texas, North Dakota and other states where Trump enjoys broad support.”

-- Organizations challenging Trump’s attempt to end protections for the Dreamers picked Ted Olson, a former Republican solicitor general and lawyer long associated with conservative causes, to argue their case before the Supreme Court. The choice might’ve been more surprising had Olson not played a similar role in the legal battle for same-sex marriage. (Robert Barnes)

­-- An undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong house in Southaven, Miss. Now, the city is fighting a civil rights lawsuit by arguing that, because of his immigration status, he wasn’t protected by the U.S. Constitution. Antonia Noori Farzan reports: “Attorneys for the small city near Memphis claim that because [Ismael] Lopez had no ‘legally recognized relationship’ with the United States, he had no rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, or the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens. ‘If he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct,’ attorney Katherine S. Kerby wrote in a brief filed Sept. 4. ‘Ismael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the ‘We, the People of the United States’ entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit.’”

-- The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill that will keep the government open through Nov. 21. Erica Werner reports: “The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it. The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- The Senate also confirmed Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to succeed Alex Acosta as labor secretary. Felicia Sonmez and Eli Rosenberg report: “Scalia was confirmed Thursday on a 53-to-44 vote. Democrats have argued that Scalia’s record as a corporate lawyer has shown him to be ‘anti-worker.’ In remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) contended that Scalia fought to protect the interests of chief executives and the wealthy elite and opposed worker protections throughout his career, describing his nomination by Trump as a ‘disgrace.’”

-- And the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Trump’s pick to become the second-highest-ranking military officer after a bruising nomination fight centering on allegations of sexual assault from a former aide. Missy Ryan and Karoun Demirjian report: “Senators voted 75 to 22 to confirm Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, who has headed U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was the lone Republican to vote against Hyten, while all Democratic senators running for president either voted against him or were absent, save Michael F. Bennet of Colorado. Bennet voted in favor.”

-- The U.S. military’s suicide rate for active-duty troops has climbed over the past five years, a Pentagon report reveals. Dan Lamothe reports: “Some 541 service members died by suicide in 2018, including 325 active-duty troops, the report said. The active-duty suicide rate was about 24.8 per 100,000 service members, up from 21.9 in 2017 and 18.7 in 2013. … Service members who die by suicide continue to be mostly male, white and under the age of 30, said Karin Orvis, director of the Pentagon’s defense suicide prevention office. The Army and Marine Corps, the services with the highest suicide rates, also have the greatest percentage of men.”

-- Trump’s pick to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives faces growing Republican concerns over his commitment to gun rights. From the Journal: “Failing to confirm [Chuck] Canterbury would leave the ATF without a permanent, politically appointed director at a time when the law enforcement agency is at the forefront of the Trump administration’s fight against violent crime and as the White House and Congress continue to negotiate gun-control measures after several mass shootings in recent months. … Mr. Canterbury tangled in his July confirmation hearing with Republican senators who were frustrated that he wouldn’t clearly define his views on gun-control measures such as expanding background checks for prospective buyers and a ban on assault rifles. He was head of the FOP when it took positions supporting more-rigorous gun-control measures including an expansion of background checks. But he wouldn’t immediately say what stance he would take if confirmed to the ATF, only that he would consult with other Justice Department officials.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency formally told California it is “failing to meet its obligations” to protect the environment. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey report: “Days after President Trump mocked Los Angeles and other big cities for their ‘tremendous pollution,’ EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an oversight letter charging California officials with failing to meet federal health standards in numerous communities where large homeless populations litter the streets with trash, drug paraphernalia and human waste. … California has long led the nation in demanding stricter limits on pollution linked to climate change. Now, the Trump administration is arguing that the state’s focus on global warming has come at the expense of more basic environmental protections.”

-- Seeking to fill the void created by Trump's inaction, six U.S. governors gathered in Manhattan on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting to confer with presidents, prime ministers and other foreign leaders to press for action on climate change. Carol Morello reports: “The governors in the group, most of them Democrats, insist they are not conducting a form of shadow diplomacy. They say neither the White House nor the State Department, which typically conducts talks with foreign governments, has tried to deter their efforts. Their mission is to assure other countries that many of America’s leaders are still engaged in combating climate change, even if the United States formally drops out of the Paris agreement next year. ‘Every party looking at this should know there is still intelligent life in the United States taking action on climate change,’ Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a co-founder of the Climate Alliance, said in a back-seat interview en route to a meeting with officials from the European Union. ‘It’s important to give the world confidence of movement, of dynamic actions being taken in America. And it’s succeeded. Not a single country has left the agreement. No one has followed Donald Trump over the cliff.’”

-- A federal judge denied a request by the news media to unseal grand jury records cited in the Mueller report. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia said she was bound by the ruling, McKeever v. Barr, and that the petitioning party, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, did not qualify for other exceptions to grand jury secrecy rules.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden’s advisers are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street now that the former vice president stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a “wealth tax” on the richest Americans. Jeff Stein reports: “The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds ... Tax experts said Biden’s embrace of that idea would mark just how much more aggressive Democrats are now willing to be on taxes.”

-- Some anxious Biden supporters want him to embrace a super PAC. From the Times: “Several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. ‘For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,’ said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. ‘And I was already thinking the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we’d need to fight this.’”

-- Democratic donors from Wall Street are threatening to back Trump or sit out the 2020 campaign if Elizabeth Warren wins the nomination. From CNBC: “‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive ... Some big bank executives and hedge fund managers have been stunned by Warren’s ascent, and they are primed to resist her. ‘They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,’ an executive at one of the nation’s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity.”

-- White, college-educated voters are driving Warren's rise in the polls. Eugene Scott reports: “The lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.”

-- In a fundraising email, Julián Castro warned that his campaign will be over is he doesn’t qualify for the November debate. From the Texas Tribune: “The email sought donations for ads to help him reach the new polling threshold: 3% in four national polls or 5% in two surveys from the first four early voting states. Castro has already met the donor requirement of 165,000 individuals but hasn't met the polling requirement — or even come close.”

-- Sen. Kamala Harris, the former attorney general of California, said Giuliani should probably be disbarred. “We need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,” the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “And frankly, if there were any members of the State Department who were facilitating Rudy Giuliani’s private conversations on behalf of the president, there should be accountability and consequence for that.” (Politico)

-- Former congressman Darrell Issa is launching a primary challenge to embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who faces an impending trial for using campaign funds to help facilitate several extramarital affairs. (John Wagner)

-- Former Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price, who resigned in disgrace, threw his hat in the ring to take over retiring Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson’s Georgia seat. From ABC News: “According to the Georgia governor's office, Price submitted his resume to be considered for replacing Isakson, who announced in August that he is resigning from his post in December due to various health issues. Isakson, 74, won a six-year term in 2016 and his term is due to end in 2022.”

-- A U.S. attorney whose office investigated interference in the 2018 midterm elections said he is certain Russia will try to meddle in the upcoming presidential race. Rachel Weiner reports: “‘They’re going to do the same thing,’ G. Zachary Terwilliger said Thursday afternoon at an event at George Mason University’s National Security Institute. ‘They’re going to do it. In an open setting like this there’s not a lot I can get into, but I think it wouldn’t be irresponsible for me to say they’re definitely going to try.’ … Terwilliger said he had heard from an administration official that ‘their big concern is deepfakes,’ or doctored images and videos. But he said he was also worried about the ‘actual physical infrastructure’ of election machines, while cautioning that the issue was outside his purview.""

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Pentagon authorized a modest air defense boost for Saudi Arabia after the attack on the kingdom’s oil industry. Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe report: “Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper’s decision to authorize the deployment of an additional battery of Patriot missiles and four Sentinel radar systems, accompanied by 200 American troops, to shore up a key ally is a modest step that represents the administration’s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions. … Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the deployment would ‘augment the kingdom’s air and missile defense of critical military and civilian infrastructure.’ ‘These steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East,’ he said in a statement.”

-- Iraq is trying to rein in its Iran-aligned militias as tensions boil in the Persian Gulf. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “Iraqi officials are worried that their country could get sucked into the conflict, with concerns spiking after a May 14 drone strike on a pipeline in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The officials were embarrassed to learn that the attack had not come from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, who had claimed responsibility for the strike, but from Iraqi territory, said lawmakers and Western officials who described the fallout. ‘The prime minister was very angry,’ said one lawmaker. … Iraqi lawmakers fear that attacks launched from their soil would not only inflame regional tensions but could provoke reprisals against targets inside their country, drawing Iraq into another ruinous conflict.”

-- Syrian government forces carried out a chlorine attack in May, a U.S. intelligence assessment found. From the Journal: “The episode took place on May 19 near the village of Kabana as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces sought to subdue resistance in Latakia province, a senior U.S. official said. … At least four people were wounded in the rocket strike, which was alleged at the time by the Syrian opposition but took months for U.S. intelligence to confirm. The Syrian government has denied the attack.”

-- The fiancée of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi is demanding that Saudi Arabia be held accountable for his murder. Oct. 2 is the anniversary of his death. Hatice Cengiz spoke with NBC News on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly: ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet,’ she said. ""Saudi Arabia was put under massive pressure, thanks to international media coverage … But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad.""

-- Trump’s privately held company, seeking to revive its money-losing golf course in Scotland, secured approval to build 550 luxury and holiday homes there, as well as a second golf course. Joshua Partlow reports: “The Aberdeenshire Council voted 38 to 24 to allow the Trump Organization’s residential development to move forward despite vocal opposition from many residents who fear it would crowd the roads and schools of their windswept village. By winning the council’s approval, the Trump Organization is poised for one of its most ambitious foreign projects of his presidency. It is also a rescue effort of sorts for Trump’s first golf course in Europe, which has lost money each year since it opened in 2012. … In a sign of its confidence in Wednesday’s vote, the Trump Organization had already begun marketing the homes as part of what it called the Trump Estate, with some homes priced at more than $1.5 million.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing extensive backlash after delivering a bombastic performance upon his return to Parliament. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “The widower of a murdered lawmaker and the sister of the prime minister joined a chorus of voices on Thursday saying [Johnson] has stepped over a line with his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit. But Johnson was refusing to change course on his language or his strategy. … Johnson drew particular fury over his remarks about Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and Brexit opponent who was murdered days before a June 2016 referendum by a far-right domestic terrorist who yelled ‘Britain first!’ before shooting and stabbing her to death. … Johnson [said] that the best way to honor Cox’s memory would be to ‘get Brexit done.’ … Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister, an author and politician who opposes Brexit, called her brother’s remarks ‘tasteless.’”

-- Afghanistan's presidential election is this weekend, and voters are torn between fear, frustration and a sense of duty. From the AP: “The Taliban have relentlessly issued threats against Saturday’s vote. The insurgent group has sent suicide bombers to rallies and election offices, killing dozens and warning they will kill more. ... Afghan officials say security preparations have been elaborate. In an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Interior Masoud Andarabi outlined an election security plan that he said has been more than eight months in the making. ... Despite the government’s best efforts, 431 polling centers will be closed Saturday because Andarabi, the interior minister, said they were too difficult to secure — either because they were under Taliban control or Taliban could threaten nearby villages.”

-- Concerns about fraud are also running high among the public and observers because it could trigger political chaos. The main challenger to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani warned of dire consequences if the polls are marred by fraud. Pamela Constable and Susannah George report: “Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan’s chief executive, did not say what he would do if massive fraud takes place, but he suggested in an interview that it would be up to Ghani to ‘act responsibly.’ ‘The results will not be accepted if there is clear evidence of fraud,” Abdullah said at his residence. ‘The signs are not good. . . . It is not an ideal situation for the country,’ he added, referring to warnings by opposition groups and leaders, including himself, that Ghani and his government will try to rig the polls.”

“I do think things have changed. . . . You have to recalibrate based on the fact that Trump’s attacks on you are going to be at the center of these impeachment hearings,” said Larry Rasky, a longtime ally of Biden who had senior roles in his two previous presidential campaigns. Rasky said he worries Biden’s campaign has been naive about the amount of resources needed to counter Trump.

The new demand that Biden simultaneously run a general-election matchup with Trump and a primary campaign against several formidable Democratic challengers risks straining a campaign that started later and has organized more slowly than some of his rivals’ efforts.

Biden’s campaign for now seems to have settled on an approach similar to the one Democrats used in the 2018 midterms, trying to ignore Trump as much as possible to focus instead on issues they believe are more resonant with voters.

Biden, who has insisted his election would return the country to normalcy, has over the past several days largely sought to avoid the political spasm in which he is now a central figure. His campaign has sent out daily statements on health care and other issues, as if leaning toward predictability in a highly unpredictable time. He has only sporadically talked about Trump’s attacks on him and his son Hunter.

At a fundraiser Saturday in Park City, Utah, the host, Barry Baker, called Trump a “lying, narcissistic traitor, cheater,” while Biden over the course of a 20-minute speech did not mention impeachment or the president’s dealings with Ukraine.

“This isn’t about me. . . . It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives,” Biden said last week.

AD

AD

Biden has sent out a string of fundraising emails — which his campaign says resulted in its best donation week since early in the campaign — and some longtime confidants hope he can avoid getting dragged into Trump’s bombastic antagonism. They have called or messaged Biden and urged him to avoid getting into a bitter back-and-forth with the president, reminding him that the political landscape is littered with foes whose character Trump has dirtied.

“For Joe Biden to get down in the mud with this guy, whatever stank on him will run off on Joe,” said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter. “He’s handling it the way he should — with restraint I could not handle on my best day. I mean, [Trump] is coming after his family. In my part of the country, there would be fisticuffs over this.”

“Trump is goading him,” he added. “But if you want a Democratic Donald Trump who screams and yells and lies, then you need to vote for someone else. Because that isn’t Joe Biden.”

AD

AD

Already the Trump onslaught has had an impact on the Democratic side of the presidential race, overshadowing efforts by Biden and others to more pointedly put Warren on defense on a host of issues.

Yet the benefit to Biden, as some of his advisers see it, is the possibility that Democrats will view his response as statesmanlike and rally behind him amid attacks they see as unfair. So far they say the approach is providing dividends.

“Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi are the three most important people in American politics right now,” said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa, who is neutral in the race. “It propels him to the limelight in ways that other folks don’t get. It seems everybody else is playing catch-up; they are trying to get the limelight back.”

The impeachment proceedings underway in the House followed revelations that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son. The administration had previously held up congressionally approved aid to Ukraine, which is in the midst of a conflict with Russia after its invasion of the Ukrainian territory Crimea.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner earlier came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Trump has delved into exaggeration and falsehoods in his fusillade of accusations against Biden. Yet the episode also has raised the uncomfortable question for Biden about whether he should have allowed his son to make money from a Ukrainian company at the same time he was overseeing the Obama administration’s efforts to crack down on corruption there. Already, several of Biden’s presidential foes have obliquely engaged on that topic.

Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor and a top Biden supporter, said he thought Biden has handled the issue “just perfectly” so far, but he quickly added that it’s hard to tell whether the accusations will have a lingering impact.

“I don’t think Democrats will think there’s any truth to the attack,” Rendell said. “But some might worry that if Biden gets elected, there will be all sorts of grand juries, and Republicans will look into this stuff. . . . Not that Democrats believe Joe would do anything corrupt, but just that it would be charge and countercharge.”

The episode has crystallized an existing sense of anxiety among some of Biden’s top donors and longtime supporters about his campaign. Some allies have been expressing concerns for weeks that Biden doesn’t seem to be the happy warrior he had been in previous campaigns. They have urged him and the campaign to adopt a more assertive and focused message, one that puts the middle class front and center.

Some of those worries have led to preliminary discussions, in Chicago and Washington, over whether to launch a pro-Biden super PAC. Biden’s campaign has publicly discouraged any outside assistance, which could open him to attacks from Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that he is being bankrolled by wealthy interests. Those discussions, first reported by the New York Times, are ongoing.

Among those involved have been Rasky; former Biden staffer Mark Doyle; Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who led Barack Obama’s campaign finance team in 2008 and was deputy campaign manager in 2012; and Democratic consultant Mark Riddle.

In a sign of what Biden is up against, the Trump campaign announced Friday the $10 million ad campaign focused on Biden, his son and Ukraine. It includes a video snippet of Biden saying the United States would withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee if Ukraine did not fire the corrupt prosecutor.

“But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him,” the narrator says. “They lost the election. Now they want to steal this one. Don’t let them.”

The Biden campaign has attempted to reassure donors and has sent out talking points to allies to encourage a public response to Trump.

“We’re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and Donald Trump just revealed to the entire world how terrified he is that he’ll lose it to Joe Biden,” Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “That’s because the contrast between the vice president and Donald Trump couldn’t be more powerful.”

On Sunday, two top Biden campaign officials sent a letter to the heads of major news and cable networks, urging them not to book Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. “By giving [Giuliani] your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,” the letter from Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.

While conceding that they are in a highly unpredictable environment, Biden advisers say their candidate will ultimately benefit from contrasts with Trump over issues and leadership.

“A lot of us who know Joe Biden think it’s incredibly unfair,” said Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. “And it’s a tactic some folks have used in the past to gain political advantage, and . . . we shouldn’t allow that. As voters, we should say, ‘Hell no, we’re not going to do that.’ ”

Vilsack, who remains uncommitted in the Democratic primary, said voters should focus on how Biden has avoided getting caught up in personal attacks. He added that the current environment is showcasing what a general election between the two men would look like — which could calm voters.

“The Biden campaign seems to be able to handle the attacks,” he said. “We really don’t know what the attacks about these other candidates are going to be.”

Some Biden allies privately draw a contrast with Warren and Trump’s assault over her past claims of Native American heritage. Afterward, she dropped rapidly in the polls; she has risen steadily over the past six months at a time when Biden was bearing the brunt of Trump’s criticism.

Alan Feirer, the party chairman in Madison County, Iowa, has expressed some skepticism of Biden in the past but said he is impressed by how he handled the past week.

“We’ve been reminded what a statesman he is because he hasn’t risen to the bait of what Trump was presenting over the past few days,” said Feirer, who is staying neutral. “I don’t think it’s instilled doubt or anything. If anything, it’s instilled more confidence and reminded people why they like him. He’s been classy.”"

The closing days of a fundraising quarter are usually hectic for presidential candidates and their top-level staffers, who are tasked with pulling in every last dime they can find and figuring out what to do with the cash. This week — punctuated by the lightning-fast ramp-up of an official impeachment inquiry into the president — was different. By Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced the move, it was clear to aides of most of the 18 at-least-semi-serious remaining Democratic campaigns that, with the country’s attention squarely on Capitol Hill and the White House, they’d suddenly fallen further off the national radar than ever before. By Thursday, that attention was even more intensely focused, and a handful of campaign operatives began ringing internal alarm bells so loudly that their candidates had no choice but to start reckoning with the painful reality that no one cares about them right now. By the end of the week, in campaign offices scattered across the country, senior-level operatives finally sat down in small groups to discuss what the path forward now looks like for their campaigns — or, in some cases, whether they have realistic ones at all. A senior aide to one campaign described his team’s Friday gathering as “a ‘we’re fucked, what do we do?’ meeting.”

The big-picture strategic concern for every campaign now is that no one has any clue how long the impeachment process will take, what kind of attention it will command, or which way its politics will break. (See: Joe Biden’s team using Donald Trump’s lashing out as evidence of Biden’s electability — proving the president is most worried about the former vice-president in the general election — while much of the rest of the field quietly bets that the deluge of news about his son will sink Biden.) But the more immediate problem for almost everyone in the still-massive field not named Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg is money. Specifically, having enough of it to maintain real campaigns for the next few months.

That’s because impeachment, for this crowd, couldn’t have come at a more delicate time: the end of the final quarter before most pols believe the race gets serious, and therefore the exact moment they were banking on generating as much coverage and attention as possible, to raise as much money as possible — to keep afloat for as long as possible, or to finally make much-needed campaign hires and investments just as voters start paying serious attention. Take Cory Booker, whose campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, circulated a memo last Saturday morning ringing his own alarm. He wrote that if the senator didn’t raise $1.7 million in the final ten days of the quarter — which ends with September, on Monday — he would have to drop out, deprived of a “legitimate long-term path forward,” in Demissie’s words. This show of vulnerability (a classic Booker maneuver, to those who know him best and are used to his attention-grabbing tactics) seemed to work at first: Money poured in, setting him up to hit the stated mark. Other campaigns watched closely for clues as to how to replicate that success, since Demissie had simply stated out loud what a handful of other campaign managers would admit only in private about their finances. But Booker’s fundraising pace slowed as the week progressed, and as the impeachment inquiry comprehensively smothered attention to any other topic, including the Democratic primary and Booker’s push.

Booker may have raised enough in the first few days to survive. But the squeeze is now on.

“The media, prior to this, was already making it a three-to-five person race, and now there’s a solar eclipse of a story that will make it really, really difficult to drive any message,” says Glen Caplin, who was a senior advisor to Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “The entire conversation now is going to be driven around Trump and impeachment, and it’s going to be a real challenge for candidates in the bottom five to get coverage, and even those in the top five to drive it on any given day.”

A senior aide to one candidate still in the race put it a little less delicately: “It sucks, actually. Impeachment’s gonna kill anyone who’s not a senator or in the top five. We’re fucked.”

The likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn’t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (“It’s been the most nationalized race I’ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,” said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it’s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the “one way you can break through right now,” since ads aren’t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn’t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, “the choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,” said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. “The main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.”

Some candidates could raise money off their potential involvement in impeachment, most prominently the House members or the senators who could have a vote on Trump’s ultimate fate. (Supporters of Kamala Harris, for one, have been highlighting clips of her past questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr.) But this has, for now, proven an unconvincing pitch for potential supporters, according to people familiar with multiple candidates’ digital fundraising numbers.

So far, candidates are largely playing it safe and keeping their heads down — they’ll answer questions about impeachment when asked, and issue statements, but no campaign has yet reset its messaging to be all about Trump’s corruption or the investigation. Even billionaire Tom Steyer — who rose to national prominence in part by campaigning for Trump’s impeachment, and who doesn’t need to raise money but could use all the attention he can get — unveiled a new global climate plan on Friday, sticking to his pre-impeachment plan. Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled a public lands proposal. But as the week closed, some aides for other campaigns considered last-ditch direction changes at their “we’re fucked” meetings. “You basically have two choices: Say outlandish shit about impeachment, or do something so big that people have to pay attention. Hard to do at tier two or below,” said one top strategist for a candidate who will, at least, make the next debate stage.

And, as Julián Castro can attest, distinguishing oneself as especially aggressive on the investigations has little demonstrated upside for lower-tier contenders. The former Housing Secretary was the first candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment in April, but he saw little if any polling bump from it. Warren, on the other hand, jumpstarted her struggling campaign in part by making a similar call after Castro.

The best bet for some such hopefuls, then, might simply be hoping the pace of impeachment news slows, and that this week’s deluge proves atypical. “I’m not sure how long it’s gonna last,” said one strategist for a faltering campaign.

Castro, for one, appears to have a similar wish. And he needs all the help he can get. “I don’t say this lightly,” he wrote to supporters on Thursday. “If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.”"

Are they simply marching, or are they politically engaged more generally? Here’s what I found.

Here’s how I did my research

AD

I collected data from participants at the Climate Strike in D.C. on Sept. 20. A 13-person research team (including me) snaked through the crowd as they lined up at John Marshall Park before they began marching, sampling every fifth person at designated increments to gather a field approximation of a random sample. In total, we collected data from 193 participants at the event, with a response rate of 79 percent.

AD

What we found is consistent with my findings from earlier research on the youth climate movement and on those with experience in what many have called the “resistance”: the broader movement that has been challenging President Trump’s administration and its polices since January 2017. Participants in the Climate Strike were predominantly female. The median age of the crowd was 22 years old. Three-quarters, or 76 percent, of the participants will be eligible to vote in the U.S. 2020 election. And their current levels of civic engagement strongly suggests they will vote.

As part of this survey, we asked participants the following question: “If the 2020 election were held today (no matter whether you are eligible to vote), who would you vote for?” Forty-one percent supported Elizabeth Warren, with by far the largest share. Bernie Sanders came in second with 20 percent of the support. Joe Biden was a distant third with 12 percent.

AD

Most participants in the Climate Strike identified as being on the political left, while 9 percent identified as politically moderate. Interestingly, those who identified themselves as “Very Left” on the political spectrum (24 percent of the crowd) also favored Warren (46 percent) over Sanders (33 percent).

AD

These activists are significantly more engaged in a range of political activities than the general American population: 46 percent reported contacting an elected official in the past year; 46 percent attended a public, town, or school meeting; and 44 percent engaged in consumer activism by boycotting or deliberately buying a certain product for political, ethical, or environmental reasons (“buycotting”).

Many report having been involved with more confrontational forms of political engagement as well. About a third of Climate Strikers, or 32 percent, reported participating in confrontational direct action in the past year.

AD

Given these levels of civic engagement and political experience, expect these new voices to make themselves heard in the upcoming elections. If the election’s outcome is not what they hoped for, don’t be surprised if there's more climate action in the streets. Based on the direct action we saw during ShutDownDC on Monday and Friday, as well as the other civil disobedience that took place around the U.S. this past week, these climate activists are willing to act.

AD

And if peaceful protest and political participation do not work, they still have other options.

Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.

“It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody’s talking points,” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week. “It’s something extra that they have to talk about.”

While leading Democrats increasingly demand forceful statements on Trump’s actions, many voters and activists are urging candidates not to stop talking about how they would provide health insurance to more Americans, shrink the gap between rich and poor, and combat climate change. Some bluntly warn that devoting too much attention to impeachment could be a costly mistake.

“Impeachment is an afterthought for a lot of people,” said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Scott County Democratic Party in Iowa. “I appreciate them coming out with a statement, but that’s about where it needs to end. I think the most important thing to carry forward for the Democrats is going to be having a message and a vision for what they are going to bring to the table.”

She added, “I think, especially in the Democratic Party, we lose elections when we make it about ‘we’re better than the other guy’ and we don’t lay out a vision.”

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the rare step of beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump last week after he acknowledged urging the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Many Democrats say dislodging Trump from office is unlikely, given the strong support for him in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed for removal.

Nevertheless, the Democratic presidential field has largely lined up behind Pelosi, endorsing her inquiry and vocally condemning Trump’s conduct. A whistleblower complaint at the center of the controversy alleges that Trump misused his office for personal gain and that unidentified White House officials took improper actions to keep it a secret. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.

Some voters expressed concerns about the Democrats forging ahead on impeachment. Diana Kroeger, 52, an independent from Hollis, N.H., who stood in line for a photo with Warren after her Friday town hall event there, said “I’m worried” about the process, fearing it will further divide the country.

Will Norona, an autoworker from Flint, Mich., who walked a picket line in front of a GM plant in Detroit last week with Sanders, said he worried that focusing on impeachment could take attention away from other issues.

“Our focus is on this,” said Norona, 43, speaking of the autoworkers’ strike.

But other Democrats, believing Trump to be increasingly vulnerable, want to see the candidates call him out more aggressively than ever.

“They’ve got to keep the focus on Trump while hot lights are on him,” said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina Democrat.

Shawana Love, 42, an undecided voter who also joined the picket line in Detroit, said seeing the Democrats take steps toward impeaching Trump gets her more excited about the election. “Impeach his a--!” Love said.

The fast-moving developments and clashing voter sentiments are prompting many of the candidates to dedicate valuable time at campaign events — and devote space on their social media pages — to responding to the latest Trump news with outrage.

But they are taking different tacks.

Warren has been pointing out that she advocated impeachment proceedings long before the recent revelations about Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.

“The way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,” Warren told reporters after Friday’s town hall. “So I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it’s important. The American people are counting on us.”

AD

AD

Some Warren allies say she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes: tackling corruption.

“For Elizabeth Warren, it’s right in the middle of the bull’s eye,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. “Assuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn’t integrate it more and more into her stump speech.”

Still, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed — a remote prospect at the moment — the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they’ve been railing against for months.

AD

Sanders has been more cautious about the prospect of impeachment. While he also supports an inquiry, a point he has emphasized repeatedly in recent days, he has long focused on policy, and he warned Democrats not to abandon work on other important issues.

AD

“The Congress of the United States must show the American people that it can walk and chew gum at the same time,” Sanders said last week in Davenport, Iowa.

Warren, Sanders and the four other senators in the race have to keep another variable in mind: They would effectively become jurors in a Senate trial if the House votes to impeach Trump and Senate leaders move ahead with a judicial proceeding.

AD

“Let’s have that trial in the United States Senate,” Sanders said in Plymouth, N.H., on Sunday. “I will do my best to look at the facts as objectively as I can.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has sought to use the impeachment inquiry to remind voters of her experience as a prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris canceled a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles to fly back to Washington for a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to which she also belongs.

Biden is tethered to the situation more directly than any other candidate. During a July 25 phone call, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation that the White House released. Biden’s son Hunter had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.

AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment.

AD

At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said that he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to “hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.” He added, “This is not about me.”

Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president.

“It’s very much a double-edged sword. On one hand, anyone kind of wants to be mano a mano with Trump right now,” said Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden — chipping away at his assertion that he’s the most electable Democrat — and “those questions have to be answered.”

In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

“I do think things have changed. . . . You have to recalibrate based on the fact that Trump’s attacks on you are going to be at the center of these impeachment hearings,” said Larry Rasky, a longtime ally of Biden who had senior roles in his two previous presidential campaigns. Rasky said he worries Biden’s campaign has been naive about the amount of resources needed to counter Trump.

The new demand that Biden simultaneously run a general-election matchup with Trump and a primary campaign against several formidable Democratic challengers risks straining a campaign that started later and has organized more slowly than some of his rivals’ efforts.

Biden’s campaign for now seems to have settled on an approach similar to the one Democrats used in the 2018 midterms, trying to ignore Trump as much as possible to focus instead on issues they believe are more resonant with voters.

Biden, who has insisted his election would return the country to normalcy, has over the past several days largely sought to avoid the political spasm in which he is now a central figure. His campaign has sent out daily statements on health care and other issues, as if leaning toward predictability in a highly unpredictable time. He has only sporadically talked about Trump’s attacks on him and his son Hunter.

At a fundraiser Saturday in Park City, Utah, the host, Barry Baker, called Trump a “lying, narcissistic traitor, cheater,” while Biden over the course of a 20-minute speech did not mention impeachment or the president’s dealings with Ukraine.

“This isn’t about me. . . . It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives,” Biden said last week.

Biden has sent out a string of fundraising emails — which his campaign says resulted in its best donation week since early in the campaign — and some longtime confidants hope he can avoid getting dragged into Trump’s bombastic antagonism. They have called or messaged Biden and urged him to avoid getting into a bitter back-and-forth with the president, reminding him that the political landscape is littered with foes whose character Trump has dirtied.

“For Joe Biden to get down in the mud with this guy, whatever stank on him will run off on Joe,” said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter. “He’s handling it the way he should — with restraint I could not handle on my best day. I mean, [Trump] is coming after his family. In my part of the country, there would be fisticuffs over this.”

Already, several of Biden’s presidential foes have obliquely engaged on that topic.

Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor and a top Biden supporter, said he thought Biden has handled the issue “just perfectly” so far, but he quickly added that it’s hard to tell whether the accusations will have a lingering impact.

“I don’t think Democrats will think there’s any truth to the attack,” Rendell said. “But some might worry that if Biden gets elected, there will be all sorts of grand juries, and Republicans will look into this stuff. . . . Not that Democrats believe Joe would do anything corrupt, but just that it would be charge and countercharge.”

The episode has crystallized an existing sense of anxiety among some of Biden’s top donors and longtime supporters about his campaign. Some allies have been expressing concerns for weeks that Biden doesn’t seem to be the happy warrior he had been in previous campaigns. They have urged him and the campaign to adopt a more assertive and focused message, one that puts the middle class front and center.

Some of those worries have led to preliminary discussions, in Chicago and Washington, over whether to launch a pro-Biden super PAC. Biden’s campaign has publicly discouraged any outside assistance, which could open him to attacks from Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that he is being bankrolled by wealthy interests. Those discussions, first reported by the New York Times, are ongoing.

Among those involved have been Rasky; former Biden staffer Mark Doyle; Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who led Barack Obama’s campaign finance team in 2008 and was deputy campaign manager in 2012; and Democratic consultant Mark Riddle.

In a sign of what Biden is up against, the Trump campaign announced Friday the $10 million ad campaign focused on Biden, his son and Ukraine. It includes a video snippet of Biden saying the United States would withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee if Ukraine did not fire the corrupt prosecutor.

“But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him,” the narrator says. “They lost the election. Now they want to steal this one. Don’t let them.”

The Biden campaign has attempted to reassure donors and has sent out talking points to allies to encourage a public response to Trump.

“We’re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and Donald Trump just revealed to the entire world how terrified he is that he’ll lose it to Joe Biden,” Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “That’s because the contrast between the vice president and Donald Trump couldn’t be more powerful.”

On Sunday, two top Biden campaign officials sent a letter to the heads of major news and cable networks, urging them not to book Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. “By giving [Giuliani] your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,” the letter from Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.

While conceding that they are in a highly unpredictable environment, Biden advisers say their candidate will ultimately benefit from contrasts with Trump over issues and leadership.

“A lot of us who know Joe Biden think it’s incredibly unfair,” said Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. “And it’s a tactic some folks have used in the past to gain political advantage, and . . . we shouldn’t allow that. As voters, we should say, ‘Hell no, we’re not going to do that.’ ”

Vilsack, who remains uncommitted in the Democratic primary, said voters should focus on how Biden has avoided getting caught up in personal attacks. He added that the current environment is showcasing what a general election between the two men would look like — which could calm voters.

“The Biden campaign seems to be able to handle the attacks,” he said. “We really don’t know what the attacks about these other candidates are going to be.”

Some Biden allies privately draw a contrast with Warren and Trump’s assault over her past claims of Native American heritage. Afterward, she dropped rapidly in the polls; she has risen steadily over the past six months at a time when Biden was bearing the brunt of Trump’s criticism.

Alan Feirer, the party chairman in Madison County, Iowa, has expressed some skepticism of Biden in the past but said he is impressed by how he handled the past week.

“We’ve been reminded what a statesman he is because he hasn’t risen to the bait of what Trump was presenting over the past few days,” said Feirer, who is staying neutral. “I don’t think it’s instilled doubt or anything. If anything, it’s instilled more confidence and reminded people why they like him. He’s been classy.”"

Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate who’s rising most quickly in the polls, answered this question in September’s Democratic debate by calling for stronger protections for labor and the environment in U.S. trade agreements with other countries. Our research suggests this approach is popular with the U.S. public. Americans like free-trade deals, but they want the deals to come with protections.

AD

AD

U.S. trade deals usually have protections built in

Free-trade deals reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, but also usually end up protecting certain constituencies. For example, developed countries’ governments often include labor and environmental provisions in trade deals, which promote core international standards on collective bargaining, child labor and endangered species. Recent trade deals between developed countries (the global North) and developing countries (the global South) have included labor and environmental standards that are just as legally binding and enforceable as the other parts within the deals. Both labor and environmental provisions have been effective in improving living standards in developing countries that trade with the United States and the European Union.

Including labor and environmental protections in trade deals boosts popular support for free trade

These are the kinds of protections Warren wants more of. So what does the public think? Our latest article in the Review of International Organizations looks at survey evidence on what people think in the United States and other developed countries.

AD

AD

Our key finding is that the public in those countries is more likely to support free trade agreements when those pacts protect the environment and labor. That’s true among those who dislike free trade, either because they believe it makes them economically insecure or because they believe free trade is unethical, as it erodes human rights and harms the planet. Low-skilled workers, who see their jobs moved into lower-wage countries, like these provisions because they think the protections level economic competition. Highly skilled workers also like them because they think the provisions are fairer and help improve conditions for workers and the environment worldwide.

This suggests that politicians such as Warren may be able to sell new trade deals to the public in nations grappling with populist policymaking and economic nationalism. For example, boosting and promoting such provisions might help generate support for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which awaits congressional ratification.

More generally, trade deals may well be more attractive to skeptics in the global North if linked to such social protections. What’s more, such measures have a relatively low cost, as they require no changes domestically and aim instead to raise the standards in the global South. Expect other politicians besides Warren to turn to them to get trade agreements through.

Although it was not exactly an unpredictable development, the arrival of formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump could change a lot of things for the Democrats hoping to face him in 2020. On the one hand, it has made it easy for impeachment fence-sitters to finally go with the flow, making impeachment itself no longer a divisive campaign issue. On the other hand, it is a massive distraction from the messages the candidates had carefully prepared before and during the early stages of the campaign, as Sean Sullivan observes:

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact …

[T]he drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, “Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.”

There is one candidate, however, who may view the impeachment issue as a possible way to get her mojo back: Kamala Harris. Molly Hensley-Clancy lays out how that might work, and why it could give Harris a boost:

Iowans know what they like about Kamala Harris. They’ve seen it on TV: the sharp-tongued, compassionate, and courageous prosecutor that leaves them imagining an unflappable black woman on the debate stage next to Donald Trump …

Her presidential campaign had fallen into a dangerous pattern: after capturing the country’s attention with moments of prosecutorial brilliance, she had seen excitement about her candidacy soar, only to fall back to Earth …

In Iowa last weekend, the roots of her campaign’s see-saw were clear: It was hard for voters to see Harris the prosecutor. Harris the presidential candidate was meandering and often indirect, struggling to present a strong argument for her own campaign …

With President Donald Trump teetering on the edge of possible impeachment, though, Harris has a clear opportunity. Kamala Harris the prosecutor is already back on Americans’ television screens and could be set for a prime role in a potential Senate impeachment trial.

I’m not so sure. Like the other five senators in the presidential race, Harris has the problem of being more or less a spectator to the drama unfolding in the House, and a prisoner to Republican control of their own chamber. Yes, she is a member of both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, potential venues of hearings related to the impeachment drive and the underlying issues. But she won’t have a chance to grill witnesses as she did during the Comey and Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, unless the Republican chairs of those committees (Richard Burr and Lindsey Graham, respectively) choose to give her and other Democrats that opportunity. In theory, Mitch McConnell could create some sort of special committee to handle ancillary investigations — of the sort that, during the early stages of the Watergate scandal, made the Foghorn Leghorn soundalike Sam Ervin and even the racist demagogue Herman Talmadge national icons. But why would he want to do that when the GOP’s party line is that there is absolutely nothing worth investigating in Trump’s conduct?

As for the impeachment trial (assuming there is one), the one thing we know for sure is that Mitch McConnell will make it just extensive enough to claim that Trump is exonerated at the end of its forgone conclusion in acquittal, and not a moment longer or deeper. And traditionally, senators have been quiet in anticipation of and during impeachment trials, in accord with the criminal-law analogy of them as “jurors” weighing evidence for the impeachment “indictment,” as I explained recently:

According to precedent, senators act like jurors, making no public statements on the proceeding until after their votes are cast (in the Clinton case, senators spoke before the vote in a closed-door session, with their remarks published in the Congressional Record after the vote).

Not a lot of headline-grabbing drama in that procedure.

While I am dubious of the idea that Harris will definitely have a “prime role” in an impeachment trial or related Senate proceedings, Hensley-Clancy is spot-on in observing that the Californian really needs a boost and probably a change in the topics she is addressing on the stump. Harris’s original campaign strategy, based explicitly on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, was to establish herself as a nationally credible candidate before or during the Iowa caucuses, and then win a breakthrough victory in South Carolina by taking away African-American support from Biden just as Obama did from Hillary Clinton. Indeed, she had an advantage even Obama didn’t enjoy, thanks to her home state holding its own primary just a few days after South Carolina, as I observed soon after she entered the race:

In the sports language often used (along with combat and gambling lingo) by political operatives, one of Harris’s people called this strategy: “the SEC primary meets the West Coast offense.” And it makes sense, on paper, particularly if Harris can go into South Carolina with a head of steam and win there.

In fact, after she boxed Joe Biden’s ears in the first candidate debate in June, it looked like Harris was emerging as a world-beater whose stock would rise in every state. But her subsequent downward drift in polling, which continued throughout the summer and into the fall, has led to a strategic reassessment by her campaign. Long story short, she’s been doing so poorly in South Carolina that she’s pouring most of her resources into Iowa to execute the sort of jiujitsu that salvaged John Kerry’s once-doomed candidacy in 2004 (Kerry was badly trailing Howard Dean in New Hampshire, so he went for broke in Iowa and won there in an upset that revived his standing in the Granite State and elsewhere). So far, it’s not working any wonders just yet: in Ann Selzer’s recent gold-standard Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, Harris was running a poor fifth with 6 percent of the vote. Trouble is, the four candidates above her in Iowa are emphasizing the first-in-the-nation caucuses, too, and unlike, say, Elizabeth Warren, Harris is not exactly setting Iowa on fire with her many personal appearances there, as Hensley-Clancy and others have reported.

And meanwhile, the news from later states on the calendar keeps getting worse for Harris. A new CNN poll of South Carolina has her tied with Tom Steyer for fifth place at a mere 3 percent — a point behind Pete Buttigieg, for whom the Palmetto State is hardly a major target. And the latest poll from California, conducted by the Berkeley IGS for the L.A. Times, has the state’s favorite daughter running fourth in single digits, 21 points behind front-running Warren.

Sure, this could all change again: The combative and compelling Kamala Harris of that first debate could return in subsequent debates, and perhaps she can find a way via impeachment to play the prosecutor again (though that role has its own perils, as Tulsi Gabbard showed in eviscerating Harris’s record as California attorney general in the July debate). What she most needs is a collapse of support for Joe Biden, who stands directly in the way of Harris’s efforts to attract African-American votes and to serve as a fallback candidate for voters worried about Warren and Sanders’s vulnerabilities as symbols of the Democratic Party’s leftward drift. But in any event, Harris will soon run out of time. At this point in 2008, Obama was doing a lot better in Iowa, South Carolina, and nationally. There’s only so long that she can remain a candidate of great, if unrealized, potential."

Both are ardent critics of the glut of money in politics, and because of their self-imposed limits, both say their campaigns are “100 percent” funded by grass-roots donors.

AD

These identical claims got our interest.

Sanders and Warren have raised most of their campaign money this year from small-dollar donations. Yet both also have tapped millions of dollars left over from previous campaigns — from a time when they had not yet adopted the strict fundraising practices they currently follow. That complicates their claim to “100 percent” grass-roots purity.

AD

It’s a good example of how the complexities of the campaign finance system sometimes get blurred in the service of an appealing talking point. Let’s dig in.

The Facts

Sanders had raised $46.3 million by the end of the second quarter, according to Federal Election Commission records. That includes $10.1 million transferred from previous campaigns.

AD

When not counting transfers, 77 percent of Sanders’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. That’s the highest share of small-dollar donations relative to total fundraising among all major candidates. When counting transfers, the share of small-dollar donations is 60 percent.

Warren had raised $35.6 million by the end of the second quarter, FEC records show. That includes $10.4 million transferred from her 2018 Senate campaign.

When not counting transfers, 67 percent of Warren’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. When counting transfers, the proportion is 48 percent.

AD

“Grass-roots funding” has no formal definition. Sanders and Warren seem to define it in terms of the money they won’t accept.

AD

Sanders doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from corporate PACs or super PACs, or from fossil fuel, drug or insurance companies. Warren doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from federal lobbyists or PACs, or fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.

Considering these restrictions, it’s plausible to describe all the money Sanders and Warren have raised directly this year as grass-roots funding.

But there’s another piece of the pie here. As noted, Sanders and Warren each have transferred nearly $10 million from previous campaigns to their 2020 presidential committees.

AD

AD

In Sanders’s case, FEC records show he had transferred $4.6 million from his 2016 to 2020 presidential campaign committee as of the end of the second quarter.

In his previous presidential campaign, Sanders had somewhat looser fundraising restrictions in place. News reports show he held at least a few events in 2015 where he sought high-dollar donations.

Time magazine reported in December 2015: “Sanders has hosted at least nine medium- to high-dollar, closed-door fundraisers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere to directly fund his own presidential campaign. Even though Sanders’ efforts sometimes have a proletarian flair — he held one $200-per-ticket fundraiser at a dive bar near a grungy Seattle park — some aspects of the Democratic insurgent’s fundraising are similar to the candidates he condemns.”

AD

AD

The New York Times reported in October 2015: “Mr. Sanders was cheered at a fancy campaign fund-raiser at the Hollywood home of Syd Leibovitch, a high-end real estate agent, and his wife, Linda, on Wednesday night. Tickets for the event sold for a minimum of $250. Those who spent the maximum, $2,700, or who raised $10,000, were invited to a ‘pre-event reception,’ according to the invitation.”

Sanders spokeswoman Sarah Ford said: “In 2016, we held zero closed-door fundraisers with high-dollar donors and accepted no donations from corporate PACs, corporate lobbyists or super PACs.”

When we asked about the high-dollar fundraising in 2015, though, a Sanders aide said, “We do not plan to transfer the amount of money from the 2016 account that came from fundraisers with high-dollar donors in attendance.”

AD

AD

The Sanders aide added that, for the 2020 campaign, grass-roots fundraisers “run alongside the senator’s schedule at public venues and are live-streamed on social media.” The aide added: “They are open to the public and tickets start at $27.”

In Warren’s case, FEC records show she jump-started her presidential campaign this year with a $10.4 million transfer from her 2018 Senate committee. The infusion allowed her to build a campaign apparatus early in the race.

For her 2018 Senate reelection campaign, Warren raised money at events with high-dollar donors. A search of her FEC records showed max contributions of $5,400 from the chief executives of DreamWorks and Yelp, media mogul Haim Saban, philanthropist Alexander Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge fund owners and wealthy investors, and some donors who have given millions to the Democratic Party. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren’s Senate campaign. (The contribution limit for individuals is $2,700 per race, but they can give that amount for both a primary and general election.)

AD

AD

Warren also benefited from some PAC donations when she ran for Senate, though it was a small share of her fundraising, as we explained in this fact check.

Warren raised $6 million in donations of $1,000 or more to her 2018 Senate campaign, a spokesman said. That’s about 23 percent of her total $25.8 million fundraising for that race. According to OpenSecrets, Sanders raised nearly $28 million in donations of $1,000 or more to his 2016 presidential campaign, a little more than 10 percent of his total $232 million haul for that race.

“The open secret of Ms. Warren’s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency,” the Times reported this month, noting “trips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha’s Vineyard, and Philadelphia — all with fundraisers on the agenda.”

AD

AD

The Warren campaign in response to our questions said the average contribution to her Senate campaign in 2018 was $29.45, a sign of broad appeal among grass-roots donors.

Warren also “raised or donated $11 million to Democrats running for office and state parties in all 50 states,” a spokesman said.

“Elizabeth’s schedule is filled with town halls and selfie lines, not closed-door fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires, because she believes that to take back the White House we need to build a grassroots movement,” Warren spokesman Chris Hayden wrote in an email. “When we made the decision to run the campaign this way, the players in the usual money-for-influence game dismissed it as naive and said it would never work and it would kill the campaign. We're pleased that our grassroots strategy has been so effective that they're now threatened enough to be attacking us for it.”

AD

The Pinocchio Test

Sanders and Warren say they’re running presidential campaigns funded “100%” by grass-roots donors. It’s a big claim with no wiggle room.

Money is fungible, so it’s an artifice to claim that money from wealthy donors last time around isn’t being used this time around.

The key here is that Sanders and Warren define their presidential campaigns as entirely grass-roots-funded because of their self-imposed restrictions: no hobnobbing with rich donors in closed events and no PAC money, for example.

But Warren held high-dollar fundraisers for her 2018 Senate run and then transferred $10.4 million from that campaign account to her presidential committee. Her Senate run raised $6 million from donors who gave $1,000 or more, and she also took some PAC contributions.

Sanders in 2015 sought and received big checks from wealthy donors. Sanders’s 2020 committee so far has gotten $4.6 million from his prior presidential campaign.

These are omissions worthy of Two Pinocchios. As a share of total fundraising, however, Sanders was less dependent than Warren on high-dollar contributions in his previous campaign.

But something deeper is happening.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/30/democrats-have-moved-left-taxes-something-deeper-is-happening/,"While Sanders may be still be on the left of the Democratic Party, the economic proposals this campaign is producing show how much the conversation around the economy has changed among Democrats, even those who are ostensibly more moderate.

Here’s what Sanders is proposing:

Under Sanders’s plan, the government would increase a firm’s corporate tax rate if its highest-paid employee earns more than 50 times what its average worker does — an attempt to encourage companies to distribute their profits more equitably. The plan would apply only to companies with more than $100 million in annual revenue.

So if the median employee makes $40,000 a year and the CEO makes more than $2 million a year, the corporation would have to pay a higher tax rate.

AD

I’m a bit skeptical about this as a policy solution, since it seems more likely that if it were in place a company would find ways to reduce its chief executive’s pay to avoid the tax rather than raising the pay of employees, which ought to be the primary goal.

AD

But there’s no question that the gap between CEO pay and workers’ pay is obscene. In 2018, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the ratio of CEO to median worker’s pay at top corporations last year was a remarkable 278 to 1 (or 221 to 1 depending on which measure you use to account for stock options). At some large corporations, the ratio is over 1,000 to 1. Over the past 40 years, while worker pay has only grown by 12 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, CEO pay has grown by more than 1,000 percent.

Sanders’s approach to this problem is a kind of outside-in one: Tell the companies they’ll be punished if the outcome of their pay reflects this glaring inequality, and then let them figure out how to fix it.

AD

Warren, in contrast, has a proposal that is in many ways more fundamental. She would mandate that large corporations serve the interests of all stakeholders (including their workers and the communities where they’re located), not just their shareholders. And she would require that 40 percent of the seats on corporate boards be filled by people elected by employees. “Codetermination” systems are in place in other countries, most notably Germany, where they seem to produce less short-term thinking (and lower CEO pay) without sacrificing economic success.

AD

But what’s striking about these kind of proposals is that they’re intended to question some of the basic premises on which our economic system has been operating for decades — and that’s now mainstream thinking in the Democratic Party. Even Joe Biden, who’s running as a moderate, is considering proposing a financial transactions tax on Wall Street, which used to be something advocated only by progressives like Warren and Sanders.

To see what an extraordinary change this is, let’s recall the tax policies of the two most recent Democratic presidents. In 1993, Bill Clinton passed a budget that included, among other things, an increase in the top income tax rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent. At the time, Republicans predicted that this would immediately plunge the United States into an outright economic cataclysm. Of course, the opposite happened: We experienced a dramatic boom, just one of the many times that reality has proved Republicans’ economic predictions to be 180 degrees wrong.

AD

But the point is that even though it raised plenty of revenue and helped lead to a balanced budget, Clinton’s tax increase was relatively modest. Just seven years before, the top rate had been 50 percent.

AD

Then after George W. Bush cut the top rate to 35 percent, Barack Obama eventually negotiated a deal whereby the Bush cuts would be retained for all but the wealthiest, bringing the top rate back to 39.6 percent — an even smaller increase than Clinton’s. In 2016, Hillary Clinton offered an intricate tax proposal that would have raised taxes on the top 1 percent of earners by about 5 percent.

So while Democrats have wanted to raise taxes on the wealthy pretty much since they were dramatically lowered under Ronald Reagan, up until now the ideas have been mostly about tweaking things around the edges. While it’s not inaccurate to say the party has “moved left” in the time since, what has really happened is that Democrats have decided that it’s politically safe to advocate for things that they probably supported years ago but worried wouldn’t fly with the electorate.

AD

And they still might not. But with inequality at unprecedented levels and polls consistently showing that wide majorities of Americans believe the biggest problem with the tax system is that corporations and wealthy people get away without paying their fair share, the last thing Republicans probably want is to have an argument about whether we should be tougher on corporations and the wealthy.

AD

But that is indeed the argument we’re going to have in 2020.

And three days before the school year began, Conlin, then seven months pregnant, was told by the dean’s office at Drake University’s law school that her scholarships would not be renewed.

The secretary that gave her the news told her it was because she was pregnant and “probably would not become a lawyer,” Conlin says.

AD

Conlin eventually made it to graduate school with the help of a loan and her wedding ring, which she hocked to a pawnshop to pay her tuition at the time. She went on to enjoy a career that has spanned more than five decades and includes time as an assistant attorney general in Iowa and one of the first two women to ever be a U.S. attorney.

But after conservative commentators began to cast doubt on Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign-trail assertion that she was discriminated against while pregnant as a schoolteacher in the early 1970s, Conlin felt the need to look back at this painful chapter in her own life.

AD

She was one of hundreds of women who shared stories on social media about being fired or discriminated against for being pregnant, a tidal wave that needed no hashtag. The chorus of voices sharing tales of misconduct served as yet another rebuttal to a concerted campaign to undermine a prominent woman’s account of misconduct.

AD

“It irritates me immensely,” Conlin said in a phone interview, of the attempts to smear Warren’s recounting of her biography. “How short their memories are. Some of them weren’t even born at the time.”

On Twitter, women told stories of being fired outright for being pregnant, as Conlin had been, or being told during interviews or meetings that pregnancy was a mark against them as they competed for positions, promotions and raises. They wrote of contracts not being renewed after they gave birth, and of positions that were revoked, as Warren says hers was. And they also spoke of more subtle forms of discrimination they faced while pregnant — being moved out of public view from a post at a bank, for example.

AD

The ranges of experiences dated from the 1960s — still a decade away from federal legislation that officially outlawed discriminating against pregnant women — to the current day, as many said these issues are far from fully resolved. Warren read some of the stories women shared on a video she posted to Twitter on Wednesday.

I was fired for being pregnant and unmarried in 2002! SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO. It was a private business with few employees and I was part-time, so I had no recourse. — Jen Strange (@jenstrange) October 8, 2019

Amy Rankin, 66, a retired public relations director in Florida, was one of those who shared her story, from 1987.

She said in an interview that she was fired from a real estate development company in Ponte Vedra Beach, a wealthy coastal enclave just south of Jacksonville, after giving birth to her second child that year.

Her bosses told tell her they wouldn’t hold her position during her leave.

AD

“They called me at home,” she said. “It was within, I’d say, 10 days of delivering my son.”

They told her she couldn’t come back to work immediately to save her job, even though she offered, she said.

She tried to file for unemployment but her old workplace tried to stop her, she said, arguing she hadn’t been terminated.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit workplace discrimination, found that she had a right to sue, after she brought her complaint to them. But with two young children, she never got around to filing a lawsuit. She eventually found another job, at an ad agency.

Rankin said she remembers as a child in the 1960s that one of her elementary school teachers got pregnant and then disappeared from the classroom. She said she never found out what happened to the woman but always assumed she was forced to leave because of her pregnancy.

“I can’t believe that there are people out there who do not believe Elizabeth Warren,” she said. “If you are a woman and you are a woman of a certain age, you have been discriminated against, whether it’s pregnancy-related or whether it’s job-related.”

The prevalence of pregnancy discrimination is hard to gauge. After being targeted by decades of lawsuits and legislation, it is perhaps less overt as it was before it was outlawed federally.

AD

“It’s still very much a pervasive issue that spans across industry, race, ethnic background and class,” said Alex Baptiste, a policy counsel at the National Partnership for Women & Families in Washington. “It shows up in different ways in different types of industries — could be a loss of promotion in a white-collar industry or lack of accommodation in a blue-collar industry.”

More than two dozen states and at least four cities have expanded protections for pregnant women beyond what is outlined in the 1978 federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act, but awareness of the laws and employees’ comfort challenging their employers can vary, Baptiste said.

The EEOC tracks federal complaints about pregnancy discrimination but not those routed to state or city agencies. The number of complaints it has received has decreased in recent years, from 4,029 in 2010 to 2,790 in 2018. About 60 percent of those complaints are typically found to have “no reasonable cause,” according to the commission.

AD

Some 9 to 12 percent result in settlements; another 23 to 25 percent are found to have merit and are resolved in other ways. The commission says that $16.6 million was paid out in settlements in 2018.

“There’s always the option of filing a lawsuit,” Baptiste said. “But it’s not an option for a vast majority of workers, because it takes a lot of time and money, and it’s by no means a guarantee.”

Warren has said that as a pregnant teacher in 1971, when she was 22, she was told that a job she had been promised was given to someone else. But Republicans and Twitter commentators have used an old interview from 2007, in which Warren talks about being pregnant, as supposed evidence that she has been misleading.

AD

Teachers who worked at the same elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., around the same time told The Post that pregnant teachers like Warren could be easily fired without cause.

“Back in those days, it was very common for people not to be rehired if they were pregnant,” said Trudy Randall, who began teaching at the school in 1968.

My dudes, women are STILL fired or not hired at all basically just for looking like they might one day soon want to become pregnant.

Conlin said it was common for teachers and women in just about every other profession to be let go after their pregnancies.

As an assistant attorney general, Conlin worked on a case involving two teachers, Joan Parr and Judy McCarthy, who were forced to take leaves from public high schools in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1972 in the middle of their pregnancies. Because Parr had less than two years of service at the school, she was effectively fired, in accordance with the district’s policy about pregnancies at the time.

The Iowa Supreme Court found that the policies constituted discrimination on the basis of sex — in what Conlin believes was one of the first of such rulings.

“To suggest that [Warren] would have been able to keep her job as a teacher while pregnant is absurd,” Conlin said. “It didn’t happen anywhere in the United States of America, as far as I know, in the 1970s. Women who were pregnant had to pretend not to be pregnant to go on working.”

1. I may know a bit about the history of teaching. It was EXTREMELY COMMON to push pregnant teachers out of their jobs, right through the 1970s.

High-profile cases continue to grab attention. In Washington, D.C., in 2016, Chipotle was ordered to pay $550,000 to a former employee after being found to have fired her for being pregnant.

In another D.C. case around that time, a spy at the Defense Intelligence Agency who was lined up for a high-profile post in an unnamed country (“Country X” in the lawsuit) said her bosses violated her rights by trying to delay a training course at the end of her pregnancy and then failing to enroll her in it.

The EEOC ordered that the spy be given another comparable offer from the DIA, that she be given back pay and that her bosses undergo harassment training.

Conlin said she recently represented an Iowa firefighter whose superiors refused to put her on lighter duty while she was pregnant, and a police officer who got similar treatment.

“I probably get a dozen calls a year from women who are being discriminated against because they’re pregnant,” she said, adding that sometimes a phone call from a lawyer is all it takes to resolve one of those cases. “I take those kind of cases very personally.”"

The headline: “County Records Contradict Warren’s Claim She Was Fired Over Pregnancy.”

Shockingly, nowhere on these documents is it stamped: “The all-male board fired this young woman because she was pregnant and because of its deep-seated misogyny.” (And, more seriously, nowhere in the story is it indicated that the renewal offer probably came before school district honchos knew Warren was pregnant.)

Conservatives and pro-Trumpers gobbled it up — and spit back out an amped-up version, one less tethered to facts. The poisoned version quickly spread into the larger mediasphere.

“Another Elizabeth Warren lie about Elizabeth Warren?” tweeted President Trump’s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, who — credit where due — does have proven expertise on the subject of lying.

AD

The right-wing Federalist agreed “lie” was the right word with its headline: “Records Show Elizabeth Warren Lied About Being Fired For Being ‘Visibly Pregnant’.”

AD

An embedded video kept it even simpler: “Warren Lied.”

Before you knew it, Fox News, in its wisdom, had jumped in. The chyron: “Warren Facing New Credibility Questions.”

Fox News anchor Dana Perino assembled some pundits to consider it — among them Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary under George W. Bush, who framed it as a troubling “character issue” for Warren. This gave Fox a chance to revisit Warren’s earlier blunder over claiming significant Native American ancestry.

Of course, it’s one of the jobs of the press to scrutinize presidential candidates — to “scrub” them, in the journalistic lingo.

AD

Elizabeth Warren is no different, liberal darling though she is.

As the Free Beacon’s Johnson told Vox, “foundational myths” spun on the campaign trail deserve skepticism: “It seems to me that these sorts of claims, whether it’s Democrats or Republicans making them, warrant scrutiny.”

AD

Fair enough. And Warren’s campaign seemed to have made a tactical mistake by not responding immediately, though they were given the opportunity by the Free Beacon, according to its story.

If Warren had shot back as cannily to this as she did to the recent absurd report that she’d had an affair with a 24-year-old Marine (she wittily tweeted out an image of her alma mater, the University of Houston and their mascots, the Cougars), she could have swatted this away.

AD

It wasn’t until the next day that some much-needed perspective began to emerge, thanks to a CBS News report.

It included crucial context that would have been ever-so-helpful in the initial piece, such as this interview with a retired Riverdale teacher, Trudy Randall:

“The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer. But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”

AD

It also included an interview with Warren about why the board originally renewed her contract and even gave her a provisional pass on some other training she needed to continue as a speech pathologist:

AD

“I was pregnant, but nobody knew it,” Warren said. “And then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck, and said he was going to hire someone else for the job.”

The CBS News piece also takes on another aspect of the Free Beacon’s story — that Warren in 2007 explained her departure from teaching without mentioning being fired. She told CBS News that going into elective politics caused her to become more open about that aspect of her past — and, in effect, to air the workplace discrimination that was rampant then and has never fully disappeared, despite being outlawed in the late 1970s.

AD

It all seems to track: There is no big controversy here. No apparent lie and no “character issue” that should unduly concern the voting public.

If there is a scandal here, it’s how — in the bad-faith media world — narrowly presented facts without sufficient context can do unfair harm.

They can and will be weaponized, falsely regurgitated and twisted beyond recognition.

The only thing missing from this mini-saga is Trump’s custom-made insult. Stand by for that.

Ben: At yesterday’s debate, Elizabeth Warren drew the kind of incoming fire from other candidates that mark her as the one to beat. Post-debate, rivals like Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden have kept up their attacks — the former said that Warren had been “more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she’s taken” than her Medicare for All plan; the latter accused her and Bernie Sanders of trying to “con the American people” into thinking a health-care overhaul would be easy. How risky is this kind of strategy for candidates who have previously chosen the high road?

Gabriel: Well they’re coming at it from different places, so their approaches have different risks. Buttigieg, for one, is trying to become the young Biden alternative, but he’s built up his image without going negative, and now he’s betting this is the way to be taken super-seriously — and, crucially, that voters are ready for these “let’s get serious”-style contrasts, and won’t rebel at the negativity. (See my story this morning on this very topic!) Biden is trying to maintain his position, and probably feels like he doesn’t have much of a choice but to draw these contrasts. Obviously neither Biden nor Buttigieg is missing the obvious fact that Sanders+Warren has more supporters, right now, than Buttigieg+Biden, which says something, but obviously not everything, about the shape of the electorate this cycle. But they’ve both picked their lane.

Ben: Warren clearly does not want to answer the question about whether her plan will raise taxes on the middle class. Some have criticized journalists for repeatedly bringing it up, arguing that their framing is misleading. But given her waffling, she seems destined to be hit with it again and again. Why do you think she doesn’t simply say, “Yes, taxes will go up, but the huge drop in health-care costs will make the tradeoff worth it,” the way Bernie Sanders does? What’s the political calculation there?

Gabriel: She’s already been asked it again and again … immediately after the debate last night! It’s probably the single question she’s been asked most over the last few weeks. But she’s clearly calculating that (a) she doesn’t want a clip out there, either in the primary or the general, of her talking about raising middle-class taxes, and (b) that she’s refused to answer this framing of the question for long enough that she’s not going to cave now and deal with all the coverage of that. But you can also see in her response how frustrated she is with the framing. She’s trying to make a specific point when she responds, not to dodge for dodging’s sake.

Ben: Do you get the sense that this is viewed as an actual potential problem, or more as something journalists are obsessed with?

Gabriel: Depends on who’s doing the viewing. There are definitely some candidates not named Elizabeth Warren who are worried about this — Buttigieg’s team, for example, loves pointing to a recent Des Moines Register poll suggesting Medicare for All is a general-election problem for Democrats. But Warren’s allies see this as little more than a gotcha that’s captivated journalists until they find their next thing.

Ben: As many have noted, Joe Biden sort of faded into the background for large stretches of the night, as candidates went after Warren instead. He also announced last night that he had only $9 million in cash on hand, significantly less than his top-tier rivals. There’s a definite narrative going on now that Biden’s long-awaited self-implosion is happening, and that he’s yesterday’s news. But he still polls very well nationally, and quite well in early states. Are we seeing more of the disconnect between what pundits expect to happen and what’s actually happening that we saw crop up earlier in this primary cycle, when his staying power came as a surprise to a lot of people?

Gabriel: I think this is a case where both can be true! He’s clearly no longer the strong front-runner, but you’d think by now that the pundit class would be a bit more careful about predicting doom for Biden. He’s shown in the last few hours alone that he’s going to turn up his contrasts a notch, clearly because he sees a problematic trend in his campaign. But he’s still polling first in many surveys and second in others. Hardly time for a massive panic, though the fundraising is a real problem.

One of the reasons Biden’s fundraising numbers are an issue, of course, is his reliance on big-dollar, in-person fundraisers rather than grassroots donations. He can’t go back to his donors and ask for more money like other candidates, because his relatively small number of donors have largely already given the legal maximum.

Ben: Amy Klobuchar had a pretty strong debate, but is right now not on track to qualify for the next one, in November, thanks to weak poll numbers. Do you think her performance could single-handedly put her on track to at least stay in the race longer?

Gabriel: I think there’s a reasonable case to be made that she did the most of any of the four onstage last night who still hadn’t qualified for November’s debate. She’s clearly made a similar calculation to Buttigieg (see above), and got a ton of speaking time out of it. Obviously, we’ll find out soon … and we’ll see how many polls there even are between now and the deadline!

Ben: Bernie Sanders did very well, especially coming off his heart attack. And he announced that AOC will be endorsing him, which is something of a coup, since some people expected her to pick Elizabeth Warren. Do you think either of these things will meaningfully boost his campaign?

Gabriel: He’s obviously at the center of attention again, and that’s been a major concern for him, so in that sense he’s already gotten a boost. We’ll see whether he’s able to stop his polling slide and start gaining new (or regaining old?) voters. But Sanders’s team was thrilled with how last night went, for good reason."

Michael Bloomberg’s flirtation with a 2020 presidential bid just won’t end. Last year, it was reported that the former New York City mayor was considering a run for the White House as a Democrat. Then in March of this year, he put the rumors to rest, writing in a column that he would pass up the chance to take on Trump. “I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election. But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,” he wrote at the time.

It only took a month for new rumors to begin. This time, reports suggested that Bloomberg was considering running if Joe Biden didn’t.

Biden, of course, is running for president. But after months as the clear Democratic front-runner, he’s recently seen his standing slip, with Elizabeth Warren edging past him in recent national polls. That reportedly has Bloomberg concerned, as CNBC reports:

Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private.

Those people caution that Bloomberg would need Biden to fall much further before he takes the plunge. “Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a source told CNBC.

But that doesn’t seem likely to happen, at least at this point. Even if Biden is no longer the clear front-runner, he’s still in good position to win the primaries. And even if the former veep was close to dropping out, there’s only one person who thinks Democratic-primary voters are eager to vote for a 77-year-old former Republican and it’s Bloomberg himself."

If you want a good indicator of how well Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign has been doing lately, consider the controversy that’s blown up in the past few days over a story she’s been telling for years. It centers on Warren’s claim, part of her account of a hardscrabble early life, that after one year working as a public-school teacher in New Jersey, she was “shown the door” by the school’s principal because she was “visibly pregnant” with her first child. Critics have noted that school records and an old interview raise doubts about the accuracy of her account.

The story gained traction on Twitter last week, after Jacobin’s Meagan Day highlighted a 2007 interview Warren gave at the University of California, Berkeley, in which she said she abandoned her career as a public-school teacher after realizing that the required graduate-school classes weren’t “going to work out” for her, making no mention of her pregnancy.

On Monday, the Washington Free Beacon ran with a solemn examination of school-board records from 1971 indicating that Warren was offered a contract to teach for another year, and instead resigned. The story quickly spread through right-wing media circles, with lots of language about Warren being “caught lying.”

Warren pushed back in an interview with CBS News published late on Monday, highlighting a central problem with the accusation: She does not appear to have said at any point that she was formally “fired:”

Warren told CBS News she stands by her characterization of getting “shown the door” because of her pregnancy and called it an “accurate description.”

“When someone calls you in and says the job that you’ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours. ‘We’re giving it to someone else,’ I think that’s being shown the door,” Warren told CBS News.

And Warren maintains the school-board records have nothing to do with the informal dismissal administered by the school principal:

Warren also told CBS News that she was, in fact, officially offered the job for the following year as the school board minutes indicate. “In April of that year, my contract was renewed to teach again for the next year,” Warren said. She also said she had been hiding her pregnancy from the school.

“I was pregnant, but nobody knew it. And then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck, and said he was going to hire someone else for the job,” Warren said.

Warren’s response is satisfying at a factual level. But there’s a bigger point here that’s worth highlighting: An essential element of informal discrimination — of the sort Warren seems to have faced — is to expect the victim to take the crucial step to avoid unpleasant confrontations. It’s not unlike the strategy of encouraging undocumented immigrants to “self-deport.”

And CBS actually turned up evidence that, in 1971, Warren was facing precisely the kind of culture of discrimination that made the story of her dismissal an appropriate point to hit in her stump speech:

Two retired teachers who worked at Riverdale Elementary for over 30 years, including the year Warren was there, told CBS News that they don’t remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school. But Trudy Randall and Sharon Ercalano each said that a non-tenured, pregnant employee like Warren would have had little job security at Riverdale in 1971, seven years before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed.

“The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,” Randall said. “But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”

As the school board minutes show, no member of the Riverdale school board at the time was a woman. A full year after Warren’s dismissal, the Associated Press wrote that a recent New Jersey State Division of Civil Rights decision meant that “pregnant teachers can no longer be automatically forced out of New Jersey classrooms.”

The story will probably fade, though on the margins you might see the right trying to link it to the “Pocahontas” narrative (based on Warren’s self-identification as a Native American in an academic directory a long time ago, and her mishandling of the issue just before her presidential campaign began). And for conservatives and swing voters bothered by the Native American business, a story suggesting that Warren embellished a tale of workplace discrimination could serve as another example of her playing identity politics without merit. For progressives with doubts about Warren, it could stir a sense that she is a Harvard elitist (and former Republican!) donning the clothes of teachers and other working mothers, while also borrowing Bernie’s populist thunder. But, again, this would only be at the margins. At any top-line level, this story is nothing for the Warren campaign to worry about.

There’s even potential it could have an upside for her: Don’t be surprised if Warren gets some sympathy from women — including Republicans and independents — who have similarly been expected to self-defenestrate at work and then keep their mouths shut."

Despite all the attention that has been given to the competition (mostly between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) for the love and support of progressive activists during the early stages of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, there’s an arguably even more important struggle underway for labor movement backing. Yes, union ranks have been steadily diminished in recent decades, and unions have been subjected to a sustained and often successful campaign of demonization by employees, shadowy dark money groups, conservative ideologues and black-robed judicial cheerleaders for corporations. But as my colleague Sarah Jones has pointed out, labor is feeling its oats in 2020:

[L]abor is seizing its moment. In a Wednesday morning speech in Milwaukee, the president of the Service Employees International Union outlined sweeping expectations for candidates who want the union’s endorsement. Mary Kay Henry praised Democrats for releasing policy plans to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, but made it clear that those plans are an inadequate substitute for releasing detailed, union-specific proposals. “The wealthy will find a way to protect their wealth, often at any cost. That’s why we need to put working people in charge. Because when workers organize, we can make bigger change, and we can make it stick,” Henry told assembled workers.

She then called for remedies that would increase union power and raise the nation’s rates of union membership. SEIU, she said, expects candidate proposals to meet four basic standards. They should prioritize union membership as a way to reduce economic inequality, and call for sectoral bargaining, where workers employed by different companies in the same industry could bargain collectively for a universal contract. They should also urge states to treat federal labor law as a floor, and not a ceiling, for labor rights, and ensure that federal workers and contractors make at least $15 an hour and have a chance to form a union if they choose. “If candidates can’t commit to these four things, they can’t count on our support,” she said, “and let’s face it, these candidates need our support.”

It’s probably no coincidence that fast-rising candidate Elizabeth Warren released her latest “plan” focused on labor rights the day before SEIU’s pre-endorsement presidential forum. And Vox’s Alexia Fernandez Campbell adjudges it as the “most ambitious” of the campaign so far. It’s certainly the longest, weighing in at 14 pages, and clearly meeting all of SEIU’s criteria. Bernie Sanders anticipated Warren’s action in August with his own “Workplace Democracy Plan.” As Campbell says, though, Warren’s is more detail-oriented:

In many ways, Warren’s ideas mirror some of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s proposals, like making it easier for workers to go on strike and letting unions bargain on behalf of an entire industry. But Warren also focuses on the minutiae — the little tweaks and changes that could make a real difference for working Americans.

About a month ago Campbell also characterized the leading candidates as a whole as falling into two groups:

Reading the labor platforms for each of the 10 candidates who qualified for the third Democratic primary debate next week, two groups emerged: the labor reformers and the labor supporters. Most of the frontrunners fall into the first category — Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg, and Sanders have all put out astonishingly detailed proposals that would shift the balance of power from businesses to workers. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang are in the second group. They seem to see themselves more as allies to workers and labor unions than true change-makers.

More recently, veteran labor reporter Steven Greenhouse gave candidates letter grades for their labor proposals, with Sanders and Warren earning an A; Pete Buttigieg an A-minus; Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, and Beto O’Rourke a B; Amy Klobuchar a B-minus; and Andrew Yang a C+. (To provide context, Greenhouse awarded Donald Trump an F-plus). It’s interesting that in almost all assessments of the field, Warren rated well even before she issued her “plan” because of deep appreciation for her trade policy proposals, which some union officials told Greenhouse were “by far the best and most sophisticated they’ve ever seen from a lawmaker.” She had also made a mark earlier with her Accountable Capitalism Act, guaranteeing workers 40 percent of corporate board positions, and her early support for California’s new legislation restoring wage, benefit, and union rights to “gig economy” workers.

Whatever endorsements individual unions make (and most are being cautious this year after too many piled onto the Hillary Clinton bandwagon early in the 2016 cycle), their memberships have a host of concerns just like any other voters, including health care (e.g., Medicare for All, which some fervently embrace while others fear as disruptive of generous health plans won at the bargaining table), specific industry concerns related to energy and the environment, women’s and minority rights, and of course electability. Any of the Democrats would be considered far superior to Trump and the party he leads. It’s notable that the pol most often singled out as representing the GOP’s bright and diverse post-Trump future, Nikki Haley, once told corporate investors they weren’t welcome in South Carolina if they brought along “union jobs.” Now more than ever, presidential general elections are a holy war for the labor movement, and its organizational muscle and enthusiasm will be valued assets for the eventual Democratic nominee."

Everyone knows that Elizabeth Warren has proposals for making child care affordable, reducing carbon-dioxide emissions, improving corporate governance, bolstering organized labor, promoting economic development in rural America, combating corruption, and addressing myriad other policy challenges that our nation faces.

But surely the senator doesn’t have a plan for everything. For example, imagine if America’s dumbest far-right grifters libelously accused her of engaging in exceptionally violent S&M with a former U.S. marine turned gigolo. Which is to say, imagine if Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman decided that they weren’t content with manufacturing bogus sexual-misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller and Pete Buttigieg, and paid some fellow idiot with a preposterously stupid name — for the sake of this thought experiment, let’s say “Kelvin Whelly” — to say that Warren hired him for “not just rough sex but extensive BDSM play,” and that “although I had a lot of experience in the business, I was shocked by the intensity, duration, and sheer violence of what Senator Warren wanted.” Imagine these allegations were all aired at a driveway press conference in front of this billboard:

Does Warren have a plan for how she could slyly wink at such an absurd and unlikely spectacle — without dignifying it with a direct response — while somehow simultaneously plugging her plans for higher education and tying it all back to her own uplifting personal story?

Does she have a plan for that?

Ben: Who do you think had a really good night tonight?

Sarah: Bernie. Warren, too. But Bernie was really impressive tonight. Sharp, clear, consistent.

Zak: Agreed. And not long after a heart attack, too. You’d have trouble getting me out of bed, let alone subject myself to this.

Ben: As others have pointed out, he was slightly toned down — which made him seem more effective.

Zak: I was never that put off by his ranting-granddad vibe, but it’s true that toning things down made his arguments seem less like insistent diatribes and more like reasonable presentations of commonsense ideas, at least superficially.

Sarah: Bernie’s tone never bothered me, to be honest. I never found him to be particularly shouty, and in any case, his unvarnished affect seems to be part of his appeal. So my takeaway isn’t really that Bernie succeeded because he toned it down. His answers were tight, his comments were critical when they needed to be, and he ably defended his policies from attack.

Zak: And I’ll echo Sarah on Warren’s good night. She weathered the attention that comes with being the front-runner way more smoothly and graciously than Biden. Less rattled, better able to lucidly stay on message, and never seemed to take anything personally.

Ben: Unlike in some past debates, the central target of the also-rans wasn’t Joe Biden, but the newly appointed front-runner, Warren. In an early exchange, she once again did not say whether she would raise taxes to fund Medicare for All, earning some criticism from Pete Buttigieg and others. Did this, or any of the other attacks against her, draw any blood?

Zak: I think her refusal to answer that question on those particular terms is a reasonable gamble. It risks her coming off as evasive, but I think pushing people to think more about overall costs versus just taxes is a net positive and has the potential to shift the terms of the discussion in a way that helps her cause. Plus the accusation themselves just aren’t that meaty. We know what her answer is going to be, and at a certain point it starts feeling like the people to whom it’s most scandalous are the reporters who insist on asking it knowing what the answer will be.

Sarah: I’d like for her to develop a more detailed answer on Medicare for All but overall I think she handled herself well. She’s made her wealth tax such a centerpiece of her campaign that the typical “but how will you pay for it” line that always gets lobbed at left-wing candidates falls a little flat. One other thing I appreciate about Warren (and Sanders, for that matter) is that she has little patience for gotcha questions, and I think that trait’s been useful to her in the debates.

Ben: Pete Buttigieg was considerably more combative in this debate than in previous affairs. He challenged Elizabeth Warren directly on her refusal to say she’d raise taxes with her health-care plan. He told Beto O’Rourke that “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” during an exchange on gun laws. In an effort to break into the top tier, he’s positioning himself as a moderate who will not hesitate to criticize those to his left. Is this working for him or coming off as arrogant? Or something in between?

Zak: There’s always something so incongruous to me about being extremely combative in defense of moderation. It’s especially off-brand for Buttigieg because we’ve come to expect this pragmatic levelheadedness and desire to stay above the fray and discourage in-fighting and all of a sudden he’s scolding everybody.

Sarah: It didn’t work for him. Look, Sanders and Warren have a clear message. Everyone knows who they are and what they represent. It’s difficult to say the same of Buttigieg. His alternative to Medicare for All sounds like a joke people would make on Twitter, and the “I’m just a sensible man from the heartland” routine is a bit rich coming from a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar whose father was a Marxist professor at the University of Notre Dame. When Buttigieg speaks, I don’t hear anything that resembles the concerns of actual voters; I hear a wonk. And while that’s partly because I’m a socialist and have different politics, I don’t think Buttigieg’s smarm is entirely a figment of my imagination.

And I agree with Zak. I think the notion of a pugnacious moderate is a bit of contradiction in terms.

Ben: Why didn’t anyone (or almost anyone) attack Joe Biden? It seems that people have crowned Warren as the obvious front-runner — but he’s still doing very well in national polls and many state polls, too.

Zak: Probably reserved about the broader implications of fueling Trump’s attacks. There seems to be a tacit agreement among Democrats not to admit openly that the Hunter business is shady, paired with a willingness to take a “wait and see” approach to how it affects Biden’s campaign moving forward.

Sarah: Trump’s complicated that a bit by going after Hunter. I actually think there’s plenty to criticize about Hunter’s business dealings, and would’ve liked to see someone press Biden on the cronyism, but nobody wants to look as if they’re aligned with Trump. I think, too, that candidates do recognize that Biden has a healthy base of support, and they’re wary of alienating those voters. Perhaps they think that Biden will self-immolate, given enough time.

Ben: That has been the conventional wisdom with him for a while and it keeps not happening — though he has faded a bit in recent weeks.

Sarah: Yes, and I think that’s due partly to his performance in the debates. He’s incoherent much of the time.

Ben: What’s up with Kamala Harris? She went from dominating the first debate to having an extended exchange where she tried to “gotcha” Elizabeth Warren by accusing her of not being onboard with banning President Trump from Twitter. That was weird.

Zak: I think she isn’t sure what she stands for and is throwing a lot of different things at the wall to see what sticks.

Sarah: I don’t think she really knows why she’s running for president?

Ben: We’ve all been there.

Sarah: Haha.

Ben: Any other candidates you thought shone or did the opposite of that?

Sarah: Why was Tom Steyer onstage? I mean, I know why, but he has no business being there.

Ben: He did not talk much.

Sarah: Right, and when he did talk, he did not do himself any favors.

Zak: Tom Steyer was like the amalgamation of every white man who’s dropped out so far. Plus Howard Schultz. I like to think they all just jumped into the same body and put it on a plane to Ohio.

Sarah: This is a terrible Transformers movie.

Zak: I was gonna say I pitched this as a Being John Malkovich sequel. No takers so far, but I’m shopping it.

Ben: Haha.

What was the most glaring absence in terms of topics? Gotta be climate, right?

﻿Zak: I think so, especially in the wake of the strikes and U.N. testimonies.

﻿Sarah: Climate, yes. But housing, too. Kind of shocking that we’ve yet to get a single question about the housing crisis.

Ben: Lastly, we’ve all noticed that the debates don’t tend to change the underlying dynamics or numbers of the race all that much. Is there anything about this one that people will remember and that will really make an impression?

Sarah: No.

Zak: Nope.

Ben: So that’s a yes?

Zak: That’s a no, Ben."

With all the buzz this week over polling on impeachment, you may have missed some trends in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. For the first time, it may be appropriate to refer to Joe Biden as the “former front-runner” or at least as “the co-front-runner.” The most-quoted source of polling averages, RealClearPolitics, has had Biden at the top of its Democratic presidential list since it began compiling such averages in December 2018 (five months before he formally entered the race). Today its two-week averages show Elizabeth Warren overtaking the former veep in national surveys with 26.6 percent to his 26.4 percent. Bernie Sanders is a distant third at 14.6 percent, and, of the other candidates, only Pete Buttigieg (5.6 percent) and Kamala Harris (4.4. percent) are above three percent. Only Biden’s 12-point lead in the increasingly outlier-like Politico/Morning Consult tracking poll is keeping him more or less in sync with Warren.

Warren is also leading Biden in the RCP polling averages for Iowa, though Biden remains slightly ahead of the field in New Hampshire and Nevada (where Sanders is second) and more impressive in South Carolina. Biden retains his lead in head-to-head general-election trial heats against Trump in the RCP averages with a 7.4 percent lead compared to 5.2 percent for Sanders, 4.5 percent for Warren, two percent for Buttigieg and one percent for Harris. In the very latest trial heat from Quinnipiac, Warren has moved into second place, leading Trump by 8 percent, with Biden still ahead of her at 11 percent and Sanders just behind her at 7 percent."

If you paid close attention to the Democratic presidential debate last week, you noticed something that Democrats might find disturbing. The two leading candidates — Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, probably in that order — both faced tough questions that could damage them in the general election. And neither appears prepared to defend themselves against what is coming.

Let’s begin with Biden, who has a simple problem with no clear solution. His son Hunter traded on his father’s name. In Ukraine, Hunter accepted a lucrative position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. Burisma surely believed hiring the vice-president’s son would give it political juice with the United States government. It did not. Joe Biden’s positions as vice-president did not benefit Burisma. He advocated the good-government line that everybody else in the Obama administration and the (small-D) democratic world took, pushing out that country’s corrupt prosecutor. His substantively correct stance did not benefit Burisma in any form.

Yet this does not fully absolve either Joe or Hunter. The latter was implicitly selling access to his father, and the fact that he did not deliver it means that he essentially conned Burisma. At a minimum, the arrangement marginally spent down the moral capital of the American government and economy by promoting the perception that official favor can be purchased through family members of powerful officials.

Trump, of course, has degraded that moral capital a million times over with his open nepotism and self-dealing. The problem Biden faces is that it is difficult to communicate the nuance of his position. How do you simultaneously say: (1) Hunter Biden was wrong to take that job, and I was wrong to let him; (2) I did not take any official action that benefited his family; and (3) Trump is using this minor corruption as cover to enable oligarchical corruption several orders of magnitude greater?

Biden’s response to this dilemma has been to elide it completely. At the debate, he simply insisted he and Hunter had done nothing wrong while deflecting the inquiry:

Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that’s what we should be focusing on.

And what I wanted to make a point about — and my son’s statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son’s statement speaks for itself. [Changes subject to Trump.]

When the moderator pointed out that he was dodging, Biden merely repeated the refrain (“My son’s statement speaks for itself”). For human and understandable reasons, Biden is obviously reluctant to scold his troubled son in public. Yet the fact remains that his son’s behavior is an albatross for the father, and all indications suggest that if Biden wins the nomination, the damage from this relationship will only become more extensive.

Warren, for her part, faced yet another round of criticism over her refusal to acknowledge the financing mechanism of the health-care plan she has endorsed. The political weak point of Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan is that it would move 157 million Americans out of employer-sponsored insurance and onto Medicare. In theory, this should work out great. (I would be happy to trade my employer insurance for Medicare.) In practice, this requires persuading half the country to swap their current insurance for a government plan and to convert their health-care premiums (which are nontransparent and remitted directly by their employer, reducing their wages only indirectly) into taxes (which are paid directly). Poll after poll shows that both these changes turn the abstractly popular notion of broader coverage upside down.

Warren’s strategy is to dodge both objections. She has, in the past, avoided the question of people losing their employer insurance by saying nobody likes their insurance company. (That’s not true: People tend to express satisfaction with their current coverage.) On taxes, she changes the question to total cost and refuses to acknowledge that taxes will go up in the swap.

Warren’s admirers consider this dodge to be clever, but the most recent debate shows just how politically damaging it could become. The problem is that Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, openly admits taxes would go up. “I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,” he conceded, while noting that “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less — substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.” The contrast between one Medicare for All supporter honestly admitting how the plan would work and the other refusing to admit it did not make her look good. It gave her opponents an opening to cast her as shady, which they seized.

Pete Buttigieg pointed out that Warren’s response was “a yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer.” Biden said, “It’s important to be straightforward with them,” and Amy Klobuchar added, “At least Bernie’s being honest here.” This is not merely a problem of Warren being associated with an unpopular policy. It is a question that is corroding her reputation for honesty, which is the foundation of her outsider, truth-telling brand.

As will Biden, Warren will find the reality that Trump is orders of magnitude worse to be of little value. Republicans have a party-controlled mass-media apparatus that has trained its rank and file to support liars, but the Democrats do not.

Warren painted herself into this corner by making an elementary mistake: She outsourced her policy position to a rival candidate. Sanders doesn’t care if he takes positions that poll horribly among the electorate as a whole — either he is genuinely invested in a magical-thinking theory of “political revolution” that sweeps away all electoral and legislative constraints or he’s running a message candidacy that isn’t even trying to win at all. By endorsing Sanders’s health-care plan, she gave him control of her message on the issue.

If Biden wants to beat Trump, he needs to put more distance between himself and his son. If Warren wants to beat Trump, she needs to ditch Bernie’s health-care plan and come up with one that doesn’t have political poison pills. The question with both candidates is, what steps are they willing to take to win?"

In a post yesterday on Joe Biden’s meh third-quarter fundraising haul, I suggested that its significance really depended on how the candidate nipping at his heels, Elizabeth Warren, did. Today we found out she did quite well, as NBC News reports:

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has raised $24.6 million during the past three months, her campaign said Friday, beating her last quarter haul of $19.1 million and quadrupling her $6 million total from the first quarter of the year.

The announcement comes as Warren, who has eschewed high-dollar events in favor of targeting small-dollar donations — continues to solidify her place at or near the top of the Democratic presidential field in both polling and fundraising. She was outpaced only by fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders — who leads the pack with $25.3 million raised in the third quarter — and dwarfed the fundraising totals announced Thursday by former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign. Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter.

Warren’s campaign also reported she had over $25 million in cash on hand at the end of September, and was making its first paid ad buys of the cycle in the early states.

All in all, it validates the gamble Team Warren made in taking the big $10 million surplus she transferred from her Senate campaign account (which, for the record, she was able to raise without the no-big-dollar restrictions she’s placed on herself in her presidential fundraising) and investing it in expensive but vital field staff in the early states, in hopes that she would be able to pay for its maintenance and expansion as new money rolled in. At the moment, it’s all working for the Massachusetts senator, whose campaign seemed to be stalled earlier this year. The most recent polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, and even California and the latest big national poll (from Monmouth) all show her taking the lead. And aside from showing her overall financial strength, the third-quarter numbers indicate she’s keeping pace with Bernie Sanders’s small-dollar money machine, even as she has largely eclipsed him in the polls.

At the moment, you could say the Democratic race remains dominated by the Big Three of Warren, Biden, and Sanders (in whatever order you choose to rank them), with fundraising dominated by a Big Four (those three plus Pete Buttigieg, who raised $24 million in the second quarter and $19 million in the third). Everyone trailing these candidates in either metric needs to make a move soon as voters prepare to vote."

Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images

The recent, steady rise of Elizabeth Warren’s presidential candidacy has obviously changed the dynamics of the 2020 Democratic nomination contest. While her strong favorability rating among Democrats has unsurprisingly paralleled her enhanced levels of support as a first-choice candidate, nagging doubts remain about her “electability” — despite the fact that she is routinely leading Trump in general-election trial-heat polls. Some of it undoubtedly flows from the unproven but widespread belief that Americans (usually other Americans, not poll respondents themselves) “aren’t ready” for a woman as president. There are also various concerns arising from Warren’s standing in her home state of Massachusetts — or even from the identity of her home state, which produced presidential-general-election losers in 1988, 2004, and 2012. Some observers even think the vastly overblown “scandal” over Warren once identifying in an academic directory as Native American — the source of the endless Trumpian “Pocahontas” taunt — is a much bigger deal than any rational assessment would suggest.

But the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she’s just “too liberal” or “too far left” for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign’s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists.

Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She’s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported, the drumbeat of warnings about Warren is getting louder, and emanates from separate sectors prone to different ideological tendencies. That became clear when leaked audio revealed Mark Zuckerberg’s fears about the candidate who has called for breaking up Facebook:

Mr. Zuckerberg and his peers running Silicon Valley’s megafirms aren’t the only executives feeling a bit uneasy about a White House potentially occupied by Ms. Warren …

Multiple polls indicate Ms. Warren’s campaign is gaining traction, and that momentum has wealthy donors warning the Democratic party her nomination would prompt them to leave their wallets in their pockets. Many of those wallets belong to company owners, influential shareholders, top executives and board members.

Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst for Raymond James Financial Inc., told me this week the changing dynamics in the election was a dominant topic in recent days. “I had many more conversations about Elizabeth Warren in the last week than I did about impeachment.”

And the emerging claim is that the very act of electing Warren could be a calamity:

Lori Calvasina, RBC Capital Markets’s head of U.S. equities strategy, said recent jitters in the stock market indicate investors are showing concern about a Warren presidency and its potential impact on markets. “People are starting to wake up to the risk” she said. As shareholders — including major institutional investors — express concern, top executives will be pressed to demonstrate they aren’t asleep at the wheel.

There are even not-so-veiled threats from investor types that they will tank the economy if voters insult them by electing Warren:

At the Delivering Alpha conference this week, [Omega Advisors CEO Leon] Cooperman sounded the alarm about a Warren win by saying “There’s unquestionably a shift to the left in this country,” and adding “They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president.”

[I]n a later CNBC interview, he revised his panic down only slightly, predicting that a Warren presidency would result in a catastrophic drop in the stock market.

In a parallel development to the prospective revolt of the capitalists against Warren, those purporting to represent the #NeverTrump faction of alienated Republicans are beginning to let it be known that their willingness to support a Democrat in order to defenestrate President Trump and take back their party is strictly conditional on the ideology of the nominee, with Warren being beyond the pale. David Drucker reported on this phenomenon last week:

Prominent Never Trump Republicans insist they would never back rising Democratic contender Elizabeth Warren, describing an election that pits the liberal Massachusetts senator against a president they despise as a choice between two unacceptable options.

A few Republicans opposed to Trump are prepared to support Warren if she emerges as the only viable challenger, affirming a commitment to topple the president at all costs. But for many well-known Republicans and unaligned political operatives inside the community of conservative Trump opponents, there are limits. Joe Biden, the former vice president, is a traditional labor Democrat they can stomach and even promote for. Warren is another matter, at least as they see things now …

“There is no universe where I will ever vote for Donald Trump and there is no universe where I could ever vote for Elizabeth Warren,” said Jennifer Horn, former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. “If Democrats really care about mending our nation, they shouldn’t be looking at the most far-Left people.”

Some #NeverTrump types are orthodox business conservatives who deplore Trumpian “populism,” and want a safe-and-sound non-populist Democrat who will return the political system to the pre-Trump status quo ante, which happens to be the basic rationale of Joe Biden’s candidacy.

So taken together, a powerful elite coalition of non-Democrats and at best quasi-Democrats is telling Democrats they cannot choose Warren because if that happens they will (a) destroy the economy and/or (b) throw the election to Trump.

The thing to watch going forward is whether Warren’s Democratic rivals begin to explicitly refer to these concerns as reasons not to nominate her, and tie their individual campaigns to an Anybody-But-Warren campaign. The fear that Warren’s (and Bernie Sanders’s) policy positions are not in line with the views of the general electorate is hardly a new one, as my colleague Jonathan Chait observed last month:

[S]he has spent most of the last year positioning herself as if the general election will never happen. At the moment, I’d feel very nervous betting the future of American democracy on Warren’s ability to defeat Trump.

The question is how Democrats measure the risk associated with a Warren nomination. There are objective measurements, including polling and sober analysis of how the 2020 general election is developing. And then there are protestations by business elites and their friends that purport to represent public opinion but seem more than a tad self-interested. Elizabeth Warren is going to point that out early and often, as one investment adviser noted:

“The more that folks in power come out against Warren, the more power she gets,” [Ed] Mills [of Raymond James Financial, Inc.] said. “When Wall Street mega donors say ‘anybody but her,’ that’s free advertising.”

These birds are smart enough to try to throw their voices like ventriloquists and claim that regular folks share their fears about Warren and “populism.” So there could be a lot of shadowboxing if and when Warren emerges as the Democratic front-runner."

Maybe it’s a coincidence, but just as the Democratic presidential nominating contest gets close to its voting phase, we are seeing a revival of shadowy threats of new “centrist outsider” candidacies. One is very familiar, per CNBC:

Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all.

Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private.

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Another comes from the opposite coast, per the Washington Post:

Bob Iger keeps saying he’s not interested in running for president. At least, not anymore.

But there’s still a small but influential push in Hollywood to get the Disney CEO to change his mind, according to two entertainment executives.

They see him as a successful — and likable — businessman who could actually take on President Trump. And be a more appealing alternative than some of the far-left populists now dominating the Democratic primary — especially as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), starts leading in some polls.

Leading this “push,” says the Post, is none other than Oprah Winfrey, herself once the object of Candidate of National Salvation talk. And here’s the kernel of sentiment that seems to be driving both the Bloomberg and Iger speculation:

“Democrats are a train wreck,” the [senior television] executive said. “The second Warren goes up in the polls — no one in corporate America will vote for her.”

And when you’ve lost “corporate America,” you’ve lost America, right?

You don’t have to have insider access or psychic abilities to suspect that beneath all the expressed boardroom fear of Warren losing to Trump is the deeper fear of Warren beating Trump and implementing her agenda. A wealth tax, aggressive antitrust enforcement, worker representation on corporate boards, and far more … Four more years of Trump may be preferable to some of these alleged Trump-haters. What is unclear is whether the new-candidate talk is legitimate, or simply an indirect way for those who oppose Elizabeth Warren to buck up Biden before it’s too late.

One thing is clear, though: It really is too late for a new candidate, however well financed, to jump into the Democratic nomination fight. Tom Steyer is as rich as any of these people, and waited until July of 2019 to launch his own candidacy. As his performance at the October 15 debate showed after he spent $47 million to buy his way onto the stage, the rich outsider “lane” in the 2020 Democratic primaries is narrow, already filled, and going nowhere. Unless Joe Biden drops out of the race tomorrow, and somehow Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar or Kamala Harris doesn’t instantly soak up his support, Bob Iger is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee, period. So the better way to understand this talk is as a trial balloon for an independent general-election candidacy of the sort that Bloomberg contemplated in 2016 and Howard Schultz considered earlier this year.

With enough money and enough overheated talk about saving America from the Scylla of Trumpism and the Charybdis of socialism, there’s plenty of time for a general-election indie bid to develop. Perhaps it can even become part of some new international centrist push, with Trump and Boris Johnson in one unacceptable camp and Warren and Jeremy Corbyn in the other.

If this kind of buzz does develop, it could help Biden (or whoever the centrist Democratic champion turns out to be) by reviving Democrat terror about third- or fourth-party threats to what is otherwise an invincible advantage over Trump, reflecting one of the theories about how Hillary Clinton managed to lose in 2016. As fate would have it, HRC herself is fanning those very flames, reports Axios:

Hillary Clinton said on David Plouffe’s podcast “Campaign HQ” this week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is Russia’s “favorite” 2020 candidate and said the country could be “grooming” her to become a third-party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She’s the favorite of the Russians …”

She told Plouffe that Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee for president in 2012 and 2016, is a “Russian asset — I mean, totally.”

Yikes. Let’s hope for Clinton’s sake that Stein is enough of a public figure to keep her from successfully suing HRC for slander. But conspiracy theories aside, an indie or third-party candidacy that lifts an unpopular Trump to the presidency once again is a specter that will haunt Democrats all the way until November of 2020. The immediate question is whether that nightmare will have a tangible effect on their own choice of candidates beginning in Iowa in early February."

After the last Democratic presidential-candidates debate in Houston on September 12, I adjudged the event as having little impact on the dynamics of the race. Sure, some candidates may have marginally helped themselves (Elizabeth Warren, as always, and probably Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, and Beto O’Rourke) and others may have hurt themselves (Julián Castro and Kamala Harris). But the overall dominance of the field by the Big Three (Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Warren) was undisturbed.

In part, the lack of drama in Houston was attributable to the lack of friction between Biden and Warren during their long-awaited first debate appearance on the same stage. Yes, Bernie Sanders was aggressively hostile to Biden’s criticisms of Medicare for All (the topic that debate moderators appear to find endlessly fascinating, at the expense of all others). But no one seemed to exude a sense of urgency about the competition, and so needles did not move.

Or did they? Whether or not the last debate made any difference, the dynamics have changed thanks to Warren’s steady rise in the polls and other indicators of candidate strength. On the day of the Houston debate, Biden had a ten-point lead over Warren in the RealClearPolitics national polling averages, and Warren was virtually tied with Sanders. Now Warren is virtually tied with Biden, with Sanders more than ten points back. On the fundraising front, Warren, like Sanders, is relying on small-dollar contributions, and like Sanders did very well in the quarter than ended on September 30 (Sanders reported $25.3 million raised, and Warren $24.6 million; Biden was significantly behind at $15.2 million). And probably most importantly, Biden’s perceived electability advantage may be eroding, as Warren is doing much better than before in head-to-head trial heats against Trump (Biden’s average lead over Trump is now 6.9 percent; Sanders’s is 5.3 percent; and Warren’s is 5.2 percent). There’s really not a lot of distance separating the Big Three — or, if you prefer, the two co-front-runners — on this particular measure of electability. And Warren’s favorability ratio among Democrats is now, according to the Morning Consult tracking poll, at 68/14; Biden’s is 73/20, and Sanders’s is 73/19.

Add in the fact that Warren now leads in the polling averages for the first two contests, in Iowa and in New Hampshire, and you can see why she rather than Biden may have a bull’s-eye on her back in the fourth debate. Reinforcing that possibility is the fact that Biden is in such a delicate position thanks to the central role he and his son Hunter are playing in the impeachment drama that has gripped Washington. His campaign has already pointedly warned rivals not to bring up the subject in the next debate. And if they (or more likely the moderators) do “go there,” then the former veep may chew scenery as the victim of a Trump smear, or as the candidate so terrifying to Trump that he risked impeachment to promote the smear.

So all in all, if anyone is to become a target in Ohio, it may be Warren. But she won’t be an easy target. For one thing, she is a skillful debater (none of the other candidates, so far as I know, went to college on a debate scholarship) who manages to convey passion without attacking other candidates, and is steadily improving her already strong ability to get wonky while remaining relatable to regular folks. And she’s pretty good at generating zingers, as she showed at the most recent multi-candidate forum (as reported by The Guardian):

During the CNN forum on LGBT issues on Thursday, Morgan Cox, the chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, asked Warren how she would react to a supporter who said: “I’m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.”

Warren replied: “Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. And I’m going to say, then just marry one woman. I’m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.”

That’s already gone viral.

Another problem with going after Warren is that the most savage GOP talking points about her are not about things Democrats are likely to touch with a ten-foot pole. Yes, she received extensive progressive criticism late last year for the DNA test she took the rebut conservative claims she had faked a Native American identity. But at this point, raising the subject just reinforces Trump’s interminably offensive “Pocahontas” labeling of Warren. The latest pseudo-scandal about Warren, a dubious claim that she made up an incident where she was “shown the door” as a teacher when she was pregnant, has aroused a some sympathy for her, particularly among women. No Democrat will bring that up, either, and if moderators do, then other candidates may well leap to her defense.

Perhaps one of the more “moderate” candidates who are lagging in the polls, such as Buttigieg, O’Rourke, or Amy Klobuchar, could bring out the old shillelagh of “too far left” for Warren or “too expensive” for her policy proposals. But they have to be careful about sounding like they are repeating Republican talking points. And such talk could tempt moderators into yet another endless discussion of Medicare for All and its effect on private insurance and tax rates — a discussion likely to give Warren and Sanders a disproportionate share of debate time.

Speaking of Bernie Sanders, no candidate’s standing is more threatened than his by Warren’s recent good fortune. And clearly, some of his supporters would like him to take her down a notch. But so far, both of these candidates have resisted various pressures to get them at odds with each other. And in the Ohio debate, Sanders may be less focused on Warren than on projecting sound health and renewed determination after his recent heart attack.

So to come full circle, could the real clash in Ohio be between Warren and Biden after all? As the candidate for whom everything’s coming up roses lately, Warren would seem to have little to gain by going on the attack at this point. And as noted above, Biden may have other fish to fry in dealing with — or perhaps exploiting — the impeachment saga. But sometimes unexpected things can happen in debates, particularly if a moderator springs a surprise or skillfully foments a fight. But all in all, the strongest debater in the field is the least likely to stumble, and stumbles by others could continue to frustrate those dismayed for one reason or another by Warren’s success."

“He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States,” Biden continued. “He sees only the power — and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.”

AD

Biden’s move came amid growing anxiety among Biden’s supporters that he is unprepared to handle the dual challenges of running a general-election campaign against Trump while simultaneously facing an intensifying Democratic primary contest.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has started to eclipse him in several polls, and Biden last week reported raising only $15.2 million during the last quarter — nearly $10 million less than Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Biden’s supporters also have bridled that Democrats have been slow to rush to Biden’s defense.

AD

Biden’s campaign on Saturday night distributed a memo to reporters from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: “Biden Campaign Will Hammer Donald Trump While Focusing On The Issues.”

AD

“This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people’s lives while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden,” Bedingfield wrote.

She outlined three strategies that the campaign is attempting to employ: calling out inaccuracies in Trump’s charges, fighting back against Trump, and talking about issues they believe voters care most about.

AD

Biden and his campaign have struggled over the past two weeks amid a flurry of developments that have launched a House impeachment inquiry in which Biden is a central player. Biden has alternated between pushing back on Trump and seeming unsure of how to handle a situation that has placed the focus on his son Hunter.

AD

For several days at a time, he had few public events, the only responses coming from his remarks at fundraisers at which a handful of reporters are allowed inside. But even then, he has openly ruminated about Trump in various directions.

Biden on Thursday night in San Francisco talked about the allegations, then quickly shifted to say, “This isn’t about me, it’s about you.” His focus then turned back toward himself, as he noted how he was the one who defeated Trump in most polls.

AD

He then went on to talk about his son, making light of a false allegation by Trump that Hunter Biden had made $1.5 billion in China.

“I wonder where the hell that money is, man, because I’ve got to pay tuitions,” Biden said. “God bless me!”

Then he said aloud that he couldn’t get into the “mosh pit” with Trump because the focus should be on issues like climate change and guns. After devoting several minutes to that, he said, “I don’t want to get sucked into this, what he likes to do.”

AD

Biden’s Post op-ed attempted to focus both on Trump’s latest attacks, as well as a broader indictment of his presidency. He criticized the president on climate change and for not doing more to stand up for the rights of protesters in Hong Kong.

AD

“Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie,” Biden wrote. “President Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth — about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.”

Biden has bet that voters are familiar with his long tenure in public life, which he hopes will make him more resilient to Trump’s attacks than earlier presidential targets.

“Please know that I’m not going anywhere,” he wrote, addressing Trump. “You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

It’s been an unsettling few weeks for the Joe Biden campaign. As recently as last month, his people were describing a strategy for the nomination contest in which the former veep, with his universal name ID and relatively broad base of voters and donors, would outlast multiple candidates in a “dogfight” that wouldn’t really sort itself out until well down the road. But in the wake of Elizabeth Warren’s polling surge, particularly in the early states, along with a weakening of Biden’s position, the spin from his campaign has subtly shifted, as reflected in this report from Politico:

Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in the Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March.

The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling numbers have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where she’s heavily invested in field organization …

[I]n the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden.

Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-Americans and more-moderate Democrats.

What this really means is that Team Biden is afraid he’s going to get skunked by Warren in the early states (or at least in three of them; he’s still doing well in South Carolina). Unsurprisingly, its story is that the real fight will begin later, once it has all boiled down to a two-candidate race centered in states where Warren’s upscale white lefty base isn’t as dominant. So don’t look at Biden’s falling poll numbers in Iowa or New Hampshire as meaning much; it’s all just an elimination contest in which Biden has a bye and a ticket to the finals.

This makes some sense, although it’s also reminiscent of what we’ve heard over the years from failed candidates who tried to stage a “comeback” or build a “firewall” after losing early. This dates to the beginning of the modern primary-dominated Democratic nominating contest, with an “ABM” (Anybody But McGovern) rallying cry in 1972 and an “ABC” (Anybody But Carter) effort in 1976 and 1980. There was similar talk on the Republican side in 2016, when someone was forever going to beat Donald Trump in the late going. Truth is, particularly for Democrats, a win in Iowa or New Hampshire has been a condition precedent for recent nomination wins, with the asterisked exception of Bill Clinton ’92, who didn’t really compete in Iowa because favorite son Tom Harkin took the state right off the table.

It is also true that Biden is particularly ill suited for Iowa and New Hampshire, states with strong progressive activist traditions and few of the African-Americans so central to his coalition. But the strategic questions for him are (1) whether the early states produce a competitor for him among party moderates and/or minority voters, and (2) whether early wins blow up someone like Warren into a world-beater who simply cannot be stopped.

So far, Biden has been very lucky that no other “moderate” or black candidate has gotten a lot of traction. Kamala Harris, who showed some potential to appeal both to white moderates and to fellow minorities, is increasingly being perceived as a Democratic Marco Rubio — all potential but no performance. Cory Booker is down in the low single digits everywhere. Pete Buttigieg has raised a lot of money and built some buzz but, unlike other white candidates, seems to have a real problem with black voters. Amy Klobuchar’s proximity to Iowa and excellent electoral history haven’t lifted her into contention. Beto O’Rourke is lucky to still be in the race, and Andrew Yang is sui generis and not yet demonstrating any path to the nomination.

But Biden’s biggest fear is that if Warren wins the first two contests, she could become unstoppable, as has every other candidate who won both Iowa and New Hampshire. The biggest Super Tuesday (March 3) state is California, where early voting will begin the day of the Iowa Caucuses. A new, high-quality PPIC poll from the Golden State shows Warren taking a narrow lead there. In the next-largest Super Tuesday state, Texas, Warren moved into second place in a mid-September Quinnipiac poll, in which she trailed Biden by a less-than-formidable ten points. If Team Biden is right and candidates like Bernie Sanders and O’Rourke fade early on, there’s no particular reason Warren might not gain even more ground there. Yes, there are an array of southern states voting on March 3 (Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) where Biden’s strength among white moderates and African-Americans will make him the early favorite. But Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Utah, Vermont, and Warren’s own Massachusetts also vote that day. The latest high-quality national Monmouth poll shows Warren with an identical three-point lead over Biden in both the early and later states

And while Warren does need to expand her support among minority voters (much as Sanders did in 2016), she’s already making progress. The aforementioned Monmouth poll shows her attracting 20 percent of minority voters nationally, eight points behind Biden. Assuming she wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gets the usual short-term “bounce,” such Biden margins could disappear.

None of this peril for Biden takes into account the impact of impeachment proceedings, which is hard to predict. Biden could attract some sympathy from Democratic voters as the victim of Trump’s impeachable efforts to get a foreign government to drop a hammer on him. But sustained attention for his son Hunter’s overseas adventures and sketchy lifestyle may not help, and Warren was the Democratic field’s first impeachment champion.

It’s also not at all certain that Team Biden’s two-candidate prophecy will come true. Yes, there’s some uncertainty about Sanders’s health at the moment, but he shows every sign of recovering and he can boast of impressive third-quarter fundraising (as can Buttigieg and, to a lesser extent, Harris and Yang). And there will be three more candidate debates between now and the Iowa Caucuses, which could upset many applecarts.

Biden’s media whisperers are smart to get a strategic narrative out there to counter the evidence that he’s losing ground to Warren. But he also needs to ensure he doesn’t get embarrassed in Iowa and New Hampshire. However much you spin, the real world still turns according to its own impervious rhythms."

But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president.

AD

The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 — each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office.

AD

“I think anybody’s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,” said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. “You know, if the person was 40 and was having some issues, I’d have concerns about it, too.”

Sanders headed home Saturday to Burlington, Vt., with no word on how long he would stay there. Jane Sanders said before his release that he would rest a “few days” but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.

AD

The campaign’s decision to wait three days to reveal that Sanders had suffered a heart attack conjured images of Hillary Clinton’s collapse in 2016 at a memorial service for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Clinton, at the time the Democratic presidential nominee, had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, but her campaign did not reveal that fact until many hours after she had fainted.

AD

Sanders aides revealed Wednesday that he had experienced chest pains at a campaign event Tuesday and had undergone a stent procedure to clear an artery blockage.

After he left the hospital Friday, his campaign released a statement from his doctors saying Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction — a heart attack. “His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician,” said his treating physicians, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj.

AD

But Sanders’s campaign declined to offer much detail about how serious his heart attack was. On Saturday, the campaign declined a request to speak directly with his doctors about his condition.

Asked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, “We just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.”

A heart attack occurs when a portion of the heart muscle is permanently damaged from a lack of blood flow, said Quinn Capers IV, an interventional cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University. In an interview Saturday, Capers said, “The most important thing that dictates how well somebody will do after a heart attack is how much of the heart muscle was permanently damaged.”

AD

Capers said the length of Sanders’s hospital stay suggests a small or moderate heart attack, after which patients can live long and healthy lives — though he cautioned that he could not know for sure because he did not treat the candidate.

Age can also be a factor in recovery, Capers said.

Health issues have dogged presidential candidates in a number of past elections. After Clinton’s fainting episode, detractors spread unsubstantiated claims of underlying illness.

AD

Sanders hasn’t faced the same scrutiny, in part because he’s struggling to gain momentum in the Democratic primary contest. Sanders doesn’t have a “strong path to the nomination,” said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster. “So it’s less of a story all around.”

AD

In 1999, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, then-Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley underwent treatment for an irregular heartbeat, prompting headlines such as “Bradley’s heart ailment injects health as campaign issue.” Although he’d managed the condition for four years and experts described it as “more nuisance than danger,” his campaign never gained traction against the eventual nominee, Al Gore.

The Sanders campaign has sought to project a business-as-usual attitude as the senator takes time away from his hectic schedule. A trio of top surrogates fanned out to campaign in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire over the weekend. And a $1.3 million TV ad buy the campaign had put off will start Tuesday in Iowa.

AD

Campaign aides have said unequivocally that Sanders will attend the Oct. 15 debate, but his campaign schedule shows no other events before then.

AD

Capers said that if Sanders were his patient, he would probably recommend seven to eight hours of sleep a night, healthy meals and time for stress release. Getting back for the debate “seems like a challenge,” Capers said, adding that if a patient told him he had to be there, he would recommend no additional activity before then.

Sanders aides have pointed to his strong fundraising as a sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy, even as he sits in third place in many polls behind Biden and Warren. Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, an impressive sum that topped all his Democratic rivals. His campaign said late Friday that it has $33.7 million in his account, a sizable war chest that could sustain campaign operations for months.

It was unclear how news of Sanders’s heart attack would affect his fundraising and his future campaign strategy. Before his heart attack, Sanders campaigned more aggressively than most, if not all, of his rivals. He often held multiple events per day, sometimes in more than one state.

AD

Whether the heart attack would shift his standing in the race was also an open question. A handful of Sanders’s Democratic rivals sidestepped questions about Sanders’s health on Saturday. In recent weeks, Warren has been rising in the polls, drawing large crowds and winning plaudits from prominent Democrats.

“I think she’s running a better campaign at this point than Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders,” said veteran Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh, an architect of Sanders’s 2016 campaign. “And obviously, Sanders has had a very unfortunate incident that has pulled him off the trail. Biden has been pulled into the impeachment debate. Both demonstrate how unpredictable politics can be and how external events can upset the race.”

It is big, offering more choices than ever. It is experienced, with candidates from every level of government and beyond. It includes more women and minorities than ever at a time when their voices are redefining the party. It is generationally and geographically diverse.

Yet, to date, there’s been little that has given Democrats the confidence that their nomination process will produce a challenger strong enough, appealing enough and politically skilled enough to withstand what will be a brutal general election against a weakened and vulnerable president. Trump’s campaign is already running a general election loaded with cash and with months of time to try to shape voters’ perceptions of Democrats negatively before their nominee is even selected.

For Democrats, almost everything about the past week should be grounds for optimism about the shape of the political landscape. The litany of things that happened to or were done by the president in just a few days is beyond comprehension, starting with the case that Trump used the powers of his office to try to damage a political opponent that is at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry in the House.

That case against the president appeared to gain strength, with closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill, and it was helped when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said there was a quid pro quo involving military aid. Mulvaney later retracted the statement, but the damage was done.

That came on the same day that it was announced that Trump had awarded next summer’s Group of Seven meeting to his Doral resort in Florida, boldly using the powers of his office to enhance his own business fortunes. After intense criticism from Republicans as well as Democrats, however, he tweeted Saturday that Trump National Doral Miami would no longer host the summit.

AD

Then there is the mess made by the Trump’s hasty decision to withdraw U.S. forces in northern Syria, which allowed Turkey to begin an assault on Kurdish forces, once U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State.

In one attempt to undo the damage, Trump sent a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatening to inflict harm to Turkey’s economy if Erdogan kept going. The language sounded as if it had been written by a make-believe tough guy rather than the president of the United States.

A fragile cease-fire agreement later brokered with Erdogan by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought some respite in the fighting but also gave Turkey much of what it was seeking.

AD

“Like two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight, and then you pull them apart,” Trump said at a Texas rally. Earlier he had dismissed the fighting as of no particular concern to the United States. Syria has “got a lot of sand,” he said. “So there’s a lot of sand they can play with.”

AD

Among those strengthened in the Middle East were the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. A meeting in the White House called with congressional leaders to discuss Syria turned into a showdown between an angry president and a resistant house speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif). He called her a “third-grade politician.” She bristled and wondered why, with Trump and his policies, “all roads lead to Putin.”

By week’s end, Trump’s Syria missteps had been denounced in a critical Washington Post op-ed written by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

AD

So almost everything about the week was grounds for optimism for Democrats — except for one event, which was the fourth Democratic debate, held in Westerville, Ohio. That debate quickly faded from view, swept aside by the tidal forces of a president on the defensive. For some Democrats, the three-hour session simply added to questions about the party’s fitness to win a general election.

AD

Much of this is a result of the continued debate performances by former vice president Joe Biden. He has been effective at times. But the sum of Biden on the stage against his rivals has been underwhelming at best, disappointing to those who see him as the most capable of winning a general election.

His poll numbers are holding up, but he has failed to consolidate the advantages he brought into the race. He has been unable to quiet questions about his readiness as a candidate.

AD

Into this vacuum has stepped Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). That she was the target for much of Tuesday’s debate was all anyone needed to know about how her standing is perceived by her rivals. For others working to win the nomination, she is the person to stop but also someone they see as having vulnerabilities to exploit.

AD

Warren is a skilled and disciplined candidate, which is why she has risen while Biden has been static at best. She knows what she thinks and has a theory of how to get to the White House. Her agenda — which includes big, structural change — the cost and complexity of her proposed policies, and her unwillingness to say how it all adds up give many Democrats pause about her ability to win in November 2020.

There are other choices, obviously. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), unabashed in his democratic socialist agenda, has the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), three of the most liberal new members of Congress. Some polls show him beating Trump in key states, though many Democrats are skeptical.

AD

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is young and heartland-based, a candidate who speaks eloquently in debates, interviews and in question periods with voters. He enjoys support from those in the party who are white and well-educated, but not yet with other voters that past nominees have needed to win the nomination, particularly African Americans.

AD

Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg are four of the 18 candidates still in the race. Could someone farther down in the pack, someone who isn’t even qualifying for the debates, capture the nomination? It’s not out of the question and surprises are always a part of the pre-Iowa, pre-New Hampshire campaign season. The hope for all those who are being ignored is to build quietly in Iowa and New Hampshire and get hot when the weather is at its coldest.

One small measure of the restlessness among at least some Democrats was a Sept. 28 tweet by Oprah Winfrey, which includes a short video clip of her talking with Bob Iger, chief executive of Walt Disney Co.

AD

“This is the man I wish was running for President of the USA,” she tweeted. In the video, she tells Iger that, if he were running, “I would be canvassing in Iowa right now. I would be going door-to-door … I wish … more than ever, every day, that you had done it.”

AD

Put aside the question of whether Iger could win a Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency, or Winfrey’s skills as a political handicapper. Her enthusiasm for someone not even in the biggest field of candidates ever assembled speaks to the degree to which the declared candidates have yet to capture imaginations, despite high levels of intensity among voters.

Because these kinds of concerns have happened before, and with some regularity, there is no reason to overstate the problem. Once voters check in and contests are held and someone begins to win primaries and caucuses decisively or consistently, perceptions of their strengths will change.

AD

But the campaign to date has produced questions that will demand answers. Can Biden step up and show something more than he has? Can Warren demonstrate that her proposals and campaign machine are enough to overcome reservations about her general election viability? Can a slipping Sanders rebound? Can Buttigieg or someone else who is less liberal than Warren or Sanders displace Biden?

Trump might look like a weakened candidate, but he will be a tenacious campaigner, willing to do anything he can to demonize and defeat his challenger. Democrats have many choices but are anxiously wondering which one of them will get the party to the White House in 2021."

You didn’t have to be clairvoyant to think that high-flying candidate Elizabeth Warren might have a bull’s-eye on her back in the fourth round of Democratic presidential candidate debates in Ohio Tuesday night. And for the most part she handled the newly intensified attention she received from moderators and rivals alike with her usual articulate and passionate debating skill. But on one point that has become a sort of hardy perennial of the debate series, she drew sustained fire and responded in a way that may draw mixed reviews.

After a preliminary round of questions in which all 12 candidates were able to comment on the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Marc Lacey of the New York Times went right back to the well about middle-class taxes and Medicare for All:

LACEY: Senator Warren, we’ve proposed — you’ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans’ college debt. And you’ve said how you’re going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you’re going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for All. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?

WARREN: So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.

Lacey wasn’t about to let that go by him, so he asked again:

LACEY: Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?

WARREN: So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.

As someone who very explicitly suggested Warren address skepticism about Medicare for All’s promises in just this way, I was impressed by this approach. But she unfortunately combined it with a refusal to answer Lacey’s specific question about taxes, so he invited Pete Buttigieg, who recently started running ads criticizing Warren and Sanders on this subject, to join in his demand:

LACEY: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, “evasive” about how she’s going to pay for Medicare for All. What’s your response?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.

Still Warren wouldn’t budge, and instead counterpunched by calling Buttigieg’s “Medicare for All Who Want It” proposal “Medicare for all who can afford it.” So Lacey impleaded Warren’s policy buddy, Bernie Sanders, into the argument:

At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health-care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less — substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, at least that’s a straightforward answer, but there’s a better way.

LACEY: Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?

No, she wouldn’t. Lacey dragged in Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden to beat up on Warren on the same point. Nevertheless, she persisted in ignoring the tax question and focusing on total health-care costs and the perfidy of the private health-care industry. Sanders tried to come to her rescue:

SANDERS: I get a little bit tired — I must say — of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.

I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health-care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

Eventually Klobuchar let her off the hook by changing the subject to long-term care, and Buttigieg trained his fire elsewhere. And Warren returned to her generally effective talking points.

Clearly, debate moderators and Warren’s rivals think her refusal to say out loud that her health-care plans will require a tax hike for the middle class is a big deal. And just as clearly, Warren thinks it’s a red herring and that her overall position on health care and Medicare for All is more compelling than an isolated focus on how the government’s share of the costs will be financed.

We’ll see how it plays out in the media echo chamber over this debate. If in the next debate in November moderators come back to this question of Medicare for All and taxes, we’ll know that whatever the public thinks, the chattering classes believe they must hear Warren submit.

Note: this post originally attributed a debate statement made by Bernie Sanders to Elizabeth Warren, due to an error in the Washington Post transcript. It has been corrected."

With a fourth Democratic candidates’ debate in the books, and many observers becoming impatient about some of the remaining 19 White House aspirants dropping out, guessing games will ensue about who will drop out next. At least one candidate, Julián Castro, has invited that sort of scrutiny with a fundraising appeal linked to a threat to quit:

News: Julián Castro's campaign says he will drop out if he doesn't make November debate. Campaign sets goal at $800,000 needed by Oct. 31



(Castro has secured needed 165,000 grassroots contributions, campaign needs to meet polling threshold and says $$$ needed to get there) — Steadman™ (@AsteadWesley) October 21, 2019

This sort of gambit worked for Cory Booker in September, so maybe Castro can get his loyalists to cough up some more dough in time to make the next stage. But soon some candidates who haven’t been doing well may calculate that they might as well stick around until voters start voting, at which point denying the obvious will become vastly more difficult. Later this week we’ll hit the 100-day milepost before the February 3 Iowa caucuses. So instead of trying to figure out who ought to quit earlier than that — today, or maybe even yesterday — a more useful exercise is to project which candidates cannot credibly survive a bad showing in the very first contest. It’s a variation on the old “how many tickets are there out of Iowa?” puzzle that the chattering classes have played for decades.

The “Big Three” Should Be All Right Unless They Totally Fall Apart

The candidates who have dominated the early going in Iowa and elsewhere, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, all have strong national followings, distinct identities, and good fundraising operations. Short of some horrid mistake that produces a free fall in support in Iowa and elsewhere, they all have enough of a national base and a plausible path to the nomination that a post-Iowa comeback is possible even if they underwhelm a bit in the caucuses. It’s also possible, of course, that one of the Big Three will decide winning Iowa is the ball game and will empty the bank account trying to do so. That’s what Hillary Clinton did in 2008. And her third-place showing in Iowa might have finished her had she not pulled a shocking upset win in New Hampshire just five days later.

Mayor Pete Really Needs Some Iowa Magic

Recent polling in Iowa has shown Pete Buttigieg doing quite well, consistently running third or fourth. But given the nature of his base of support, he absolutely needs to do quite well in both Iowa and New Hampshire; later on, his struggle to win over minority voters could become fatal to his candidacy if he hasn’t already established himself as viable. Since his current strategy appears to be to position himself as the “moderate alternative” to Joe Biden, Mayor Pete’s best path to the nomination is to beat Biden in Iowa and then begin to make himself the strongest moderate in the race, particularly if Warren and Sanders continue to fight it out for supremacy among progressive voters.

Bennet, Beto, Booker, Bullock, Klobuchar, and Probably Harris Are Iowa-or-Bust Candidates

There are quite a few White House aspirants who will likely have to (or need to) drop out if they don’t finish really well in Iowa. The most obvious is Amy Klobuchar, whose proximity to the First-in-the-Nation Caucus State has been central to her candidacy all along. Like fellow Minnesotans Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann (briefly viable in 2012 on the Republican side) and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (who dropped out in 2016 after polling poorly in Iowa), Klobuchar isn’t going to convince voters anywhere else she’s worth considering if she can’t win over her neighbors.

Colorado senator Michael Bennet and Montana governor Steve Bullock are also from relatively near Iowa and have spent significant time there. They also have in common that they are part of the crowd of candidates (along with Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris) who have been auditioning to become moderate alternatives to Joe Biden. Since neither has been on a debate stage since July, it’s hard to imagine their highly theoretical rationales for candidacy surviving a poor or even meh showing in Iowa.

The same is likely true of Beto O’Rourke, whose early fundraising and high name ID, and then a modest revival after the gun massacre in his hometown, have given him more staying power. But once voters vote, his long-standing “potential” may be used up.

Booker built one of the strongest early organizations in Iowa, and given the fact that he has no other states to fall back on if he falters there, he, too, should be good or gone after February 3. And you can make a strong case that Harris, briefly a world-beater after a strong first-debate performance, has to finish in the money in Iowa as well, after she decided to focus her entire candidacy on an Obama-style breakthrough there. Conversely, Biden can clear out a lot of potential moderate-lane and African-American competition if he badly beats all these rivals in Iowa, which is a good reason for him to keep spending time there despite having stronger support elsewhere.

Steyer and Yang May Be Impervious to a Bad Showing

Tom Steyer, I am sure, wants to do well in Iowa as much as anyone else. But he has the resources to survive a poor finish there, and in quite a few other states as well, so long as he doesn’t become too discouraged to go on. Andrew Yang is a niche candidate who has already exceeded every reasonable expectation, without raising those expectations above what he can accomplish. He’s raising money pretty well, too, and has no particular geographical base, so why should he drop out after Iowa?

Perhaps Tulsi Gabbard is a niche candidate, too: sort of the Dennis Kucinich of the 2020 cycle, with an ideological positioning that probably secures a hard kernel of support. But it’s unclear whether she has the appetite for that kind of quixotic run. As for Castro, his path to the nomination depends on making it to Nevada, where he could in theory draw on support from fellow Latinos, but it’s doubtful he can survive until then.

Candidates Who Are Going Nowhere Anyway Can Meander On After Iowa

Some of the above candidates, of course, and several others who have made less of a mark on the contest, can keep going on a sort of energy-saver mode after doing poorly in Iowa because they don’t need a lot of money or support to hang around and/or don’t have time-consuming day jobs. The model for this kind of sort-of candidacy is provided by Miramar, Florida, mayor Wayne Messam, who is not raising or spending much of anything. A livelier version of the eternal candidate may be Marianne Williamson, who has pretty good name ID and some fundraising ability, along with no discernible path to the nomination that she can screw up with a poor performance in Iowa or anywhere else. If she wants to stick around, she can. The very wealthy John Delaney is a sort of Tom Steyer with less money and a lot less support. And who knows why Tim Ryan is still in the race (though focusing most of his attention on his real campaign, the one for reelection to the House) — or Joe Sestak?

So to get back to the perennial question, how many tickets out of Iowa are there likely to be, counting only candidates who are truly viable? The traditional answer has always been three. For the reasons cited earlier, there will probably be four tickets out of Iowa this time around: the Big Three plus some lucky dark horse aiming for Biden’s vote, minority voters, or some sweet spot in the center of the party."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about Medicare-for-all at a town hall last week, then faced inquiries from reporters on impeachment. Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.

“It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody’s talking points,” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week. “It’s something extra that they have to talk about.”

While leading Democrats increasingly demand forceful statements on Trump’s actions, many voters and activists are urging candidates not to stop talking about how they would provide health insurance to more Americans, shrink the gap between rich and poor, and combat climate change. Some bluntly warn that devoting too much attention to impeachment could be a costly mistake.

“Impeachment is an afterthought for a lot of people,” said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Scott County Democratic Party in Iowa. “I appreciate them coming out with a statement, but that’s about where it needs to end. I think the most important thing to carry forward for the Democrats is going to be having a message and a vision for what they are going to bring to the table.”

She added, “I think, especially in the Democratic Party, we lose elections when we make it about ‘we’re better than the other guy’ and we don’t lay out a vision.”

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the rare step of beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump last week after he acknowledged urging the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Many Democrats say dislodging Trump from office is unlikely, given the strong support for him in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed for removal.

Nevertheless, the Democratic presidential field has largely lined up behind Pelosi, endorsing her inquiry and vocally condemning Trump’s conduct. A whistleblower complaint at the center of the controversy alleges that Trump misused his office for personal gain and that unidentified White House officials took improper actions to keep it a secret. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.

Some voters expressed concerns about the Democrats forging ahead on impeachment. Diana Kroeger, 52, an independent from Hollis, N.H., who stood in line for a photo with Warren after her Friday town hall event there, said “I’m worried” about the process, fearing it will further divide the country.

Will Norona, an autoworker from Flint, Mich., who walked a picket line in front of a GM plant in Detroit last week with Sanders, said he worried that focusing on impeachment could take attention away from other issues.

“Our focus is on this,” said Norona, 43, speaking of the autoworkers’ strike.

But other Democrats, believing Trump to be increasingly vulnerable, want to see the candidates call him out more aggressively than ever.

“They’ve got to keep the focus on Trump while hot lights are on him,” said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina Democrat.

Shawana Love, 42, an undecided voter who also joined the picket line in Detroit, said seeing the Democrats take steps toward impeaching Trump gets her more excited about the election. “Impeach his a--!” Love said.

The fast-moving developments and clashing voter sentiments are prompting many of the candidates to dedicate valuable time at campaign events — and devote space on their social media pages — to responding to the latest Trump news with outrage.

But they are taking different tacks.

Warren has been pointing out that she advocated impeachment proceedings long before the recent revelations about Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.

“The way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,” Warren told reporters after Friday’s town hall. “So I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it’s important. The American people are counting on us.”

AD

AD

Some Warren allies say she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes: tackling corruption.

“For Elizabeth Warren, it’s right in the middle of the bull’s eye,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. “Assuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn’t integrate it more and more into her stump speech.”

Still, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed — a remote prospect at the moment — the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they’ve been railing against for months.

AD

Sanders has been more cautious about the prospect of impeachment. While he also supports an inquiry, a point he has emphasized repeatedly in recent days, he has long focused on policy, and he warned Democrats not to abandon work on other important issues.

AD

“The Congress of the United States must show the American people that it can walk and chew gum at the same time,” Sanders said last week in Davenport, Iowa.

Warren, Sanders and the four other senators in the race have to keep another variable in mind: They would effectively become jurors in a Senate trial if the House votes to impeach Trump and Senate leaders move ahead with a judicial proceeding.

AD

“Let’s have that trial in the United States Senate,” Sanders said in Plymouth, N.H., on Sunday. “I will do my best to look at the facts as objectively as I can.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has sought to use the impeachment inquiry to remind voters of her experience as a prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris canceled a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles to fly back to Washington for a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to which she also belongs.

AD

Biden is tethered to the situation more directly than any other candidate. During a July 25 phone call, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation that the White House released. Biden’s son Hunter had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.

AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment.

AD

At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said that he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to “hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.” He added, “This is not about me.”

Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president.

“It’s very much a double-edged sword. On one hand, anyone kind of wants to be mano a mano with Trump right now,” said Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden — chipping away at his assertion that he’s the most electable Democrat — and “those questions have to be answered.”

In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, “Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.”"

If you want another indication that Elizabeth Warren has arrived as a co-front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, here you go (from The Daily Beast):

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) … has been in contact with [former Florida gubernatorial nominee Andrew] Gillum over the past several months, multiple knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast …

[T]wo sources said the talks between Warren and Gillum resemble the kind of courtship that happens when a leading presidential candidate is exploring potential vice-presidential contenders. One source briefed on the communications said the two Democrats have been in contact over the course of the campaign and that it is the “strong impression” that Gillum is a possible vice-presidential contender for Warren, who has risen in recent months to become a front-runner in the 2020 primary, the source said.

Warren’s campaign is denying that anything veepish is going on here and contends that she’s just consulting Gillum (for whom she cut an ad last year) as part of learning the lay of the land in the Sunshine State. Florida is holding what could become a key primary role (its contest is on March 17, two weeks after Super Tuesday) and is, of course, a major general-election battleground state. Among other things, Gillum is heading up a major voter-registration drive there.

Who knows what’s really going on? Even if she were eyeing Gillum as a running mate, Warren wouldn’t want to admit it at this point, since it would show a certain Harvardian hubris to be thinking much about whose hand to clasp in Milwaukee at the national convention before the first vote is cast to choose a nominee.

But it does raise a question: When is an appropriate time to begin thinking about a veep?

Everyone would agree not to follow the old-school tradition, in place until pretty recently, of figuring it all out at the convention itself. That approach was generally abandoned after 1972, when George McGovern struggled to find a willing running mate and then hastily chose Senator Tom Eagleton, whose previously undisclosed history of treatments for mental illness led to his resignation from the ticket under pressure just 18 days after his selection. The need for careful vetting was reinforced in 2008 when John McCain impulsively and in great secrecy picked little-known Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who subsequently proved to have some pretty alarming gaps in her knowledge base and threatened to upstage her senior partner on the campaign trail.

At the other end of the spectrum, there’s always the possibility that a candidate could not only choose but announce a running mate before winning the nomination, making the “ticket” a part of the campaign. It’s happened only twice: in 1976 when, shortly before the convention, Ronald Reagan announced Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate in the unsuccessful hope of moving enough delegates from Gerald Ford to upset the incumbent; and in 2016 when another Republican, Ted Cruz, joined hands with former rival Carly Fiorina in April, soon after Trump had mathematically locked up the nomination.

Let’s just say the jury is out on the wisdom of this move, though it could work in certain circumstances. It has been mentioned in this cycle most often with respect to Joe Biden, who has reportedly considered naming a young pol early on to assuage concerns about his age.

The question of timing is heavily influenced by the criteria a candidate has for choosing a running mate. If, for example, a presidential aspirant is auditioning as a “unity candidate” in a divided party, aligning with someone from another part of the party might make sense, either as a primary-season tactic or a post-primary graceful gesture. In 2016, for example, it might in retrospect have saved Hillary Clinton a whole world of trouble had she chosen, well before the convention, a running mate (perhaps Sherrod Brown of Ohio, perhaps even Warren) who was pleasing to Bernie Sanders supporters.

A variation on the unity rationale for a relatively early veep choice is the need to address a particularly significant weakness displayed by the principal candidate. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that midway through the primaries Warren is locked in a tight battle with Biden, who is still showing his current disproportionate strength among African-American voters. A “surprise” ticket with an African-American could make some tactical sense, particularly if she’s already comfortable with the prospective running mate and has done a full vet.

That brings us back to Gillum. He’s young (just 40), male, progressive without being abrasive about it, and, as noted above, from a crucial state. True, his highest office so far has been mayor of Tallahassee, but that’s a city with a population nearly twice as large as Pete Buttigieg’s South Bend.

Truth is we have no idea whether Gillum has become the apple of Warren’s eye or is just a good pol for her to know. Inaccurate veep speculation is a chronic disease of the chattering classes, emanating from campaign factions, would-be running mates, bored reporters, and even devious opponents. A wide consultation is indeed a good idea as long as the candidate doesn’t accidentally offend a prospect by raising expectations too high. In the end, running mates don’t usually matter that much in general elections, and the Democratic veep candidate isn’t likely to cut much ice in the kind of polarized cage match 2020 is certain to be. But as Biden shows, serving as vice-president can become a pretty good credential for a future run for the top job, so it will always be one of the greatest rewards a candidate can confer — and, as the cliché goes, the first key decision made by the next president of the United States. If the vetting process begins early and is serious, it could even encompass sooner rather than later a meaningful look at whether this or that option would make a good president."

Fundraising numbers for the third quarter, which ended on September 30, won’t be reported by the Federal Election Commission until after the October 15 reporting deadline. So we’re learning about money hauls from the campaigns themselves, and it’s something of a chess match as to who announces what and when.

Clearly Bernie Sanders’s campaign was excited to announce his boffo $25.3 million quarter, whether or not it had any inkling that the candidate was about to be hospitalized. Pete Buttigieg too had to be pleased with his $19.1 million raised. Even though it fell short of the $24.9 million he brought in during the second quarter, it was still very good for a candidate who’s not in the top three in national and early-state polls. Andrew Yang should be proud of the $10 million he raised; he’s definitely outperforming expectations and the polls once again. Cory Booker professed to be happy with his $6 million-and-change totals, after he told supporters he might have to fold his tent if they didn’t cough up some more dough. And given her campaign’s recent struggles, Kamala Harris could express quiet satisfaction with raising $11.6 million, just short of her second-quarter contributions.

Another number dropped today, for the candidate perceived to have been the front-runner for most of the cycle, Joe Biden, and it’s not going to blow anyone’s socks off: He raised $15 million, or so he said at a fundraising event (his campaign may have been surprised he had said that and initially declined to comment before confirming the number as $15.2 million). That’s not quite like the $22 million he reported in the previous quarter, except for the fact that he again trailed Mayor Pete. Looking at it from another angle, Biden still did 50 percent better than Yang, but I’m guessing the leader of the Gang has a much slimmer payroll to meet.

Biden’s fundraising totals will fully be placed in perspective only when Elizabeth Warren, for whom nearly everything has been coming up roses, reports her third-quarter numbers. Her heavy-on-field-staff campaign has been fueled by the $10 million she was able to transfer from her Senate campaign account and then a solid $19.2 million second quarter. If she moves ahead of Biden in fundraising now, much as she has been moving ahead of, or at least toward him, in polls, it could be significant, particularly since she has been much choosier in how and from whom she raises money. (We’ll probably have to await the FEC reports to find out details like each campaign’s cash on hand, too.)

Biden’s clearly not going to have to tell his staff to work without pay anytime soon, but, as in many other respects, he’s a presidential candidate flying around without much of a net."

Ctrl + N

Satya Nadella will be in Washington today making the case that Microsoft is the tech titan that the federal government can trust.

“Trust as an asset is at the center of most discussions we have with government leaders,” the Microsoft chief executive will say at the company's Government Leaders Summit, according to prepared remarks shared exclusively with The Technology 202.

“We know that government leaders need to trust in technology and in technology providers, which we work to earn every day, just as governments are looking to build trust with their own stakeholders and citizens,"" he'll say in the speech to about 200 government officials and tech leaders. Nadella will dedicate much of the speech to underscoring the company's commitment to privacy, cybersecurity and ethics.

Nadella is clearly trying to carve out a competitive advantage for Microsoft, which has managed to stay out of the eye of the storm in Washington where its tech rivals are at the center of growing techlash. As the U.S. government increasingly buys tech products from big tech players, Microsoft may have an edge since it doesn't face the same scrutiny of its business from federal and state regulators. As companies such as Amazon and Google are battered with antitrust investigations and privacy mishaps, Microsoft can avoid playing defense — and make a positive pitch to work with government. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Nadella also made clear that Microsoft is doubling down on trying to do business with the federal government after tech companies have faced backlash for working with the military and Trump administration.

“We want to partner with government — not to be dependent on us from a technology standpoint, but to become independent users and builders of technology, working together with us,” he will say.

Nadella will highlight Microsoft's commitment to building “responsible” artificial intelligence, as the government turns to Big Tech to keep up with the latest in AI and cloud computing. “We believe in responsible AI, and ask the tough questions, like not just what computers can do but what they should do,” Nadella will say.

Nadella's sales pitch represents a very different tack from that of Google, which dropped a key artificial intelligence contract with the Pentagon last year after employees protested due to concerns that the technology they built would be used for warfare. Google also backed off from bidding for a major government cloud computing contract, known as Project JEDI.

But while Google has moved to the sidelines, Amazon and Microsoft have increasingly been trying to make inroads with government agencies. Earlier this year, Microsoft secured a $7.6 billion deal to build software for the Pentagon. They companies also are the two finalists for the Pentagon's $10 billion cloud-computing Pentagon contract, known as Project Jedi. The Pentagon pressed pause on the contract this summer amid concerns that Amazon was receiving favoritism from the department.

Nadella today will highlight the many ways that the U.S. military is already using Microsoft technology. Here are some of the example examples he'll cite:

The U.S. Navy is using Microsoft's Speech to Text to transcribe courtroom hearings, speeding up a previously costly and time-consuming process.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation are using Microsoft's software to predict patients' needs and develop new payment models for diseases.

The Department of the Interior is using Microsoft's software to help manage its drones, which allow the agency to monitor more than 500 million acres of land for events like earthquakes or floods.

Army Corps of Engineers will use Microsoft's databases to plan responses to disasters and deploy personnel to sites when a national emergency is declared.

In the prepared remarks, Nadella notably steered clear of more controversial applications of Microsoft's tech, such as how it could be deployed in battlefield settings or used to support the Trump administration's immigration policies. Microsoft had its own employee protests last year when employees demanded that the company cut ties with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in protest of the Trump administration's policies at the border. Nadella wrote an internal memo to employees where he said the company's contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement supported “legacy mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads,” not any projects related to separation of migrant families.

Today's summit marks Nadella's first trip to Washington since early 2019. Izzy Santa, a company spokeswoman, tells me he will not be meeting with lawmakers or the White House — which is also a different approach than other tech executives took in recent visits. Nadella met with Veterans Affairs officials at Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center yesterday to show how an Xbox controller could be used to help veterans with therapy.

Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly said that Nadella visited MedStar Washington Hospital Center yesterday. Nadella was at Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

BITS: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is calling on Congress and state authorities to scrutinize how Facebook handles politicians' content.

Warren is calling for hearings and investigations as she raises concerns that Facebook is allowing President Trump to run ads containing information that is “obviously untrue.”

Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an “existential” threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

Warren is calling out Trump's ads just two weeks after Facebook announced it would not send ads from politicians' to its third-party fact-checking partners. Warren noted that Trump and Zuckerberg recently met at the Oval Office and questioned what happened during that meeting. She also said that Trump has been a large spender on Facebook ads, spending over a million dollars a week.

After that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on “misinformation” in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers. Put another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

They’re allowing Trump to spend over $1 million a week right now for ads on their platform—including ones that air the same lies that TV stations won’t. Here’s an example of an ad that Facebook let Trump run despite being obviously untrue: https://t.co/sQdKCmrkOr pic.twitter.com/2X2S95Ep0H — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

We need accountability. That should start with Congress and the appropriate state authorities opening investigations and conducting hearings to make Facebook executives explain the company’s policies and practices—under oath. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Warren's tweets. Warren’s comments are just the latest in an escalating feud between the lawmaker and the tech giant. Warren has long called to break up Facebook and other big tech companies, putting her at odds with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. A report last week that Zuckerberg called Warren an “existential threat” to the company have accelerated those tensions.

Warren also criticized Facebook for not doing enough to address election interference during the 2016 election, and she raised concerns that the company remains unprepared for 2020.

There’s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played in that successful attack, nor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

NIBBLES: A bipartisan group of roughly 40 states attorneys general will join an antitrust investigation into Facebook led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The wide support for the probe illustrates a growing concern from regulators that Facebook may engage in anticompetitive behavior that undermines its rivals.

James also met with officials from the Federal Trade Commisssion and the Department of Justice yesterday, which are conducting their own probes into Facebook's competition practices, as Margaret Harding McGill first reported yesterday in Axios. Axios reported that James and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general were expected to meet with Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Associate Attorney General for antitrust Makan Delrahim.

The new details highlight how the investigation into Facebook has expanded since James first announced the probe alongside seven other states and the District of Columbia last month. More states could join the probe yet, Tony reports.

A spokesperson for James in New York declined to comment. Facebook pointed to a previous statement on the investigation, which said the company work constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.”

BYTES: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a 2018 decision to throw out more than $500 million in damages owed by Apple to the University of Wisconsin for infringing on one of its patents. The win for Apple comes as it endures heavy scrutiny from federal regulators over its business practices.

A licensing body for the University of Wisconsin research first sued Apple in 2014 for allegedly ripping off its processor technology and incorporating it into several iPhone and iPad versions. Apple disputed the claims, but a federal jury slammed Apple with more than $243 million in damages — a number it doubled in 2017 after Apple continued to infringe on the patent. But a specialized federal patent court ultimately ruled that Apple could not have infringed on the patent and threw out the damages.

The University of Wisconsin at Madison’s patenting and licensing arm told the Hill that it would continue to pursue damages from Apple.

-- The number of online deepfakes, or videos manipulated with artificial intelligence, has doubled to more than 15,000 in the past seven months — and most of them are pornographic, researchers tell Tom Simonite at Wired. The new findings come as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed two laws last week regulating the technology: one that would allow victims of deepfake porn to sue and one that makes it illegal to distribute political deepfakes within 60 days of an election. Free-speech advocates have already criticized the laws.

It was obvious to anyone who’d been paying attention heading into Tuesday night’s debate that Elizabeth Warren — now the front-runner in Democrats’ presidential nominating contest — would get her share of heat from her competitors. But in the final moments before game time, as CNN’s panelists discussed their expectations, David Axelrod made a narrower prediction. It would be a problem, he said, for Pete Buttigieg if the South Bend mayor didn’t target Warren, after all the work he’d been doing to preview that attack — most prominently debuting a new ad on Tuesday — in recent days.

The viewers who were watching Buttigieg closely knew exactly what Axelrod was talking about. Three hours later, the rest of the country has now also seen a punchier Buttigieg than ever before, as he makes a risky wager — a bet on a largely new campaign tack — that could define the trajectory of his candidacy.

Over the course of the debate in suburban Columbus, Buttigieg clashed with Warren over the details of her Medicare for All support and her plan to pay for it. But he did not reserve his fire exclusively for Warren. He also disagreed vehemently with Tulsi Gabbard over Middle East policy, and ripped into Beto O’Rourke over his position on an assault-weapon buyback plan — perhaps the tensest exchange of the night (“I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or otherwise,” the mayor said).

It was a break from the more mild-mannered Buttigieg voters had gotten to know over the first four debates, and over his first ten months in the national eye. This candidate, eager to look like a truth-teller and get in the mix as the bigger-name contenders wage ideological war, has sharper elbows than the version who’s quietly been building up his Iowa operation in recent months. It’s all part of a bet he’s making that drawing these kinds of stark contrasts now — just as more voters tune into the race, and just as Warren surges — can position him to be an alternative to Joe Biden for moderate voters, or that it can at least vault him from the floor of the race’s top tier, alongside Kamala Harris, to somewhere in the vicinity of Bernie Sanders’s third-place status.

But his gambit is far from straightforward.

By turning a fight with Warren into one of his centerpiece moments in the national eye, Buttigieg is also gambling that undecided voters now actually want to see this kind of disagreement, even after the last three candidates to try and make such striking attacks on stage — Harris, Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, all on Biden — saw no long-term polling gain. He’s hoping that it doesn’t tank his support among the slice of progressives that has been willing to give him a look. And it’s based on an expectation that voters who have gotten to like Buttigieg’s brand of low-key moderation and calls for generational change won’t rebel against these kinds of explicit critiques of his rivals.

Buttigieg and Democrats around him have been most eager to pick the health-care fight, according to multiple people in his orbit. Though he’d found himself clashing with Warren supporters in the last week for labeling grassroots donations “pocket change” in a recent interview while making a point about general-election fundraising strategy, and though he’d engaged in a back-and-forth with O’Rourke — who trails him in most polling — over gun policy, he has been trying to put himself more forcefully in the middle of the health-care fight with ads in early-voting Iowa touting his own alternative to Medicare for All. It’s a strategy he’s following more successfully than others who’ve tried a version of it, like Steve Bullock, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper, and John Delaney.

Those close to Buttigieg are fond of pointing to a late September Des Moines Register poll demonstrating fear among some Democratic caucus-goers that Medicare for All could cost the party in the general election, and on Tuesday Buttigieg released a digital ad criticizing Sanders and Warren by name while touting his own plan. It was the first candidate ad of the cycle directly going after named opponents, and Buttigieg onstage accused Warren of being evasive over her plan’s funding, a reflection, he said, of “why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.”

Buttigieg isn’t the only candidate whose path ahead relies on Biden faltering. But in order to truly take Biden’s place at some point, he’d need to massively expand his support among both African-American voters and Democrats who aren’t yet fully engaged in the primary — two groups that have been Biden’s core supporters, but with whom Buttigieg has struggled. He’s now committed himself to a future firmly within that lane, with little wiggle room after he said onstage that Warren’s and Sanders’s health-care proposals would “unnecessarily divide this country” in a post-Trump world. Some of the fury that has long come Biden’s way from progressives fed up with his centrism is now certainly headed Buttigieg’s way.

To hear his allies tell it, Buttigieg’s new strategy makes sense because voters are now demanding clarity on what divides the candidates, and they’ll appreciate his new assertiveness. That may make the difference between his position in the top five and a place in the top three. It will, at the very least, determine whether the hopeful candidate who’s tried to spur a generational revolution can now credibly convince people to think of him as the moderate hope."

Ben: This week, Elizabeth Warren said that she would forgo high-dollar fundraisers in a general-election campaign against President Trump. She had previously maintained that she would drop this rule, which she has been following during the primaries, if she won the nomination, saying that she is not a fan of “unilateral disarmament.” Will her change of heart put her at a disadvantage?

Josh: I don’t think we know. The argument against doing this, obviously, is that these fundraisers can bring in a lot of money, some of which she won’t collect if she doesn’t do them. And it’s not just money for her own campaign, but for the Democratic National Committee and for state Democratic Parties, which use the funds to support Democratic efforts more broadly.

But there are empirical questions we don’t have answers to: How much money actually won’t be donated, which she would have managed to raise if she did these appearances like other nominees typically have? Can she use a promise not to do such fundraising to generate more grassroots money, or will she be rewarded for it by voters? And — I think most importantly — how will she spend the time that is freed up by avoiding the time suck that is high-dollar fundraising?

Eric: Yes. There’s also the question of whether money lost from holding such fundraisers will just be diverted into pro-Warren super-PACs. On the one hand, given the meteoric rise of online fundraising — and the eagerness of the Democrats’ (increasingly deep-pocketed) base to fight Trumpism with their wallets — it isn’t that hard to see Warren keeping her coffers full without meeting and greeting big-dollar donors.

Josh: I’m confused about why declining to engage in glad-handing would lead to more money in super-PACs.

Eric: The super PACs could hold glitzy fundraisers even if the Warren campaign doesn’t.

Josh: The DNC and the state parties can hold the glitzy fundraisers, too, and they will. The question is whether donors, who expect to be able to come see the candidate and, with a high enough ticket price, talk with the candidate, will be willing to write the checks if they don’t get to do that. I think one point in favor of Warren’s strategy is: Why do people write large checks to political campaigns and parties? If they’re writing the checks because they hope to get access, they may already be sour on Warren, which makes this sort of stuff a less efficient use of her time than it would be for another nominee. And if they’re writing the checks just because they are ideologically motivated, her rule may allow her to collect that money more efficiently: Those donors might like face time with the candidate, but if they know nobody is getting it, maybe they will still send their checks anyway.

Ben: Matt Yglesias tweeted this morning that one of the problems with Warren’s approach is that “every time Warren has a second- or third-degree interaction with a donor it will be reported as a hypocrisy story while Trump continues to collect bribes through his hotels on a daily basis with no reaction.” What do you make of that argument?

Josh: What I lay out there is an argument for why it might (might! not saying it is) be a good decision for her to choose to continue not spending time on this during a general election. That doesn’t mean she needs to make a public commitment to it.

Eric: I feel like those kind of stories would be written about Warren either way.

Josh: I tend to think, in general, campaign-finance issues move very few voters, especially in general elections. So I’m not sure it matters if Warren gets attacked over that later.

Eric: I think one potentially awkward aspect of Warren’s stance is that lower-profile, down-ballot Democrats can’t afford to emulate her example. So if Warren effectively equates glad-handing with corruption, then she’ll be tacitly accusing virtually every other Democrat of that sin.

Josh: On the other hand, if Warren doesn’t spend her time courting high-dollar donors, those donors might divert more of their donations toward down-ballot candidates who are willing to attend fundraisers.

Eric: True. Or potentially true.

Josh: I think people are looking too hard for a general principle here, and I think it’s quite possible that Warren has good reasons to adopt this strategy that aren’t necessarily generalizable. I think people are looking at it too much as an ideological decision and not enough as a tactical one.

Eric: Do you think announcing this pledge now has tactical value in the primary?

Josh: I don’t know how much it matters in the primary — presumably, if it helps that’s because it covers her left flank. You’re probably better positioned to get inside the head of a Bernie voter than I am.

Eric: I can see the argument that this sort of gesture isn’t going to win over Bernie diehards, even as it risks feeding concerns about electability (though I sorta doubt it’ll have much impact whatsoever).

Josh: I do have an idea about “why now” though: She’s had another eight months of experience campaigning, and the campaign has a better sense of how it can raise money, and might be more confident it can honor the pledge.

Ben: She did raise the second most of any primary contender last quarter, trailing only Bernie Sanders, who also shuns big donors.

Josh: And she has dry powder. A lot of those Establishment figures who wrote max-out checks to Joe Biden will end up writing checks to her if she is the nominee,

whereas I don’t know how many of her grassroots donors will give to Biden if he is nominated.

Ben: To what extent do you think a Democratic nominee who DOES attend some glitzy galas will depress donations among small donors? is this something most voters care that much about?

Josh: In a general election, I don’t think so. I understand fighting over it in a primary — you’re trying to figure out which candidate is MOST committed to your values, and how they raise money is a signal of that. In a general election, I don’t see how this creates daylight versus Donald Trump.

Eric: I sorta doubt it. I think the benefit is probably going to come more in the form of saved time than more grassroots funding.

Josh: Yeah, I think people really underrate that aspect — this frees up a ton of time.

Eric: Another point that Sean McElwee raised on Twitter: In recent presidential history, these closed-door events have tended to produce monumental gaffes. The deplorables remark, cling to your guns, the 47 percent — all came when candidates let their hair down in front of their favorite rich people.

Josh: Oh god, yes. I’d put it slightly differently: Candidates direct their comments to the interests of an audience, and these audiences have different interests than the electorate. Whether that’s harsher economic messages (“47 percent”) or excessively contemptuous cultural messages (“deplorables”).

Now, a disciplined candidate should be careful about that. This comes up in other situations too: You shouldn’t say something to an activist group you wouldn’t want in the paper, either. But yeah, it’s one less venue to screw up in."

Sanders is second at 21 percent, and Biden, the front-runner since his entrance into the race, is at 18 percent. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala D. Harris each draw 5 percent.

Although it’s just one survey, the findings suggest that Warren’s growing popularity, evident in other polls, comes from her increasing appeal beyond the party’s left wing. And with Warren also establishing herself as the second choice for many Democrats currently backing other candidates, she may be well-positioned to pick up more support as the field thins.

The GW Politics Poll is a joint venture of George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs, Department of Political Science, and Graduate School of Political Management. The survey, conducted by YouGov and including interviews with 600 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, went into the field Sept. 26, two days after House Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry, and was completed Sept. 30. As a result, respondents were probably aware of Biden’s entanglement in the Trump-Ukraine drama but didn’t know about Sanders’s heart attack, which was revealed after the poll ended.

Warren appears to be broadening her appeal

Warren has throughout the campaign had her strongest support from the most liberal Democrats. And, not surprisingly, 4 in 10 voters who call themselves “very liberal” say they would vote for her. But the survey confirms she is now winning over other voters. Among Democrats who call themselves simply “liberal,” she is polling at 33 percent, 12 points ahead of Sanders and 17 points better than Biden.

AD

AD

Biden, meanwhile, continues to hold a lead among moderate and conservative Democrats, with 28 percent. But in what may be a sign of concern, he is polling just 12 points better among those voters than both Warren and Sanders.

Warren’s improvement among less liberal Democrats also means she’s doing slightly better with black voters, who are more ideologically conservative than whites. Long mired in single digits, Warren is at 13 percent among black voters (and Sanders at 12) in the GW Politics Poll, though she still trails Biden at 35 percent by a significant margin.

Warren’s image is also evolving. Respondents were asked whether they prefer elected officials who “make compromises with people they disagree with” or those who “stick to their positions.” Despite Warren’s reputation as a proponent of “uncompromising liberalism,” 34 percent of Democrats who said they prefer compromise are backing her. Among those who prefer politicians to stick to their positions, Sanders is the top choice (26 percent), with Biden at 20 percent and Warren at 18.

AD

AD

Warren is the prevailing second choice

Perhaps the poll’s most bullish finding on Warren comes from asking respondents whom they would support if their favored candidate dropped out or they had to choose someone else. Warren is the second choice of 34 percent of voters who support another candidate. That includes 45 percent of Biden voters and 31 percent of Sanders voters.

On the other hand, the numbers don’t look as good for Sanders and Biden. Sanders is the second choice of just 21 percent, and Biden is the second choice of 17 percent.

At the same time, Warren has work to do to win over voters who aren’t currently backing one of the other top-polling candidates (Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris). Among supporters of the many candidates polling below 5 percent, 20 percent have Biden as their second choice and 18 percent have Warren. This appears to be a function of ideology, as the lower-tier candidates’ supporters tend to be more moderate.

AD

AD

But views about Warren may also be less crystallized. Seventy-two percent of Democrats say they have a favorable impression of her, trailing Sanders (79 percent) and slightly better than Biden (69 percent). But 12 percent don’t know enough to give her a rating, twice as many as her two main rivals. Assuming Warren continues to get lots of media attention, that number will almost certainly diminish.

The implication of all this is that among the three front-runners, Warren appears to be in the best position to pick up supporters when other candidates start to pull the plug.

Warren’s rise isn’t about women

Finally, the GW Politics Poll also suggests that Warren’s rise is not being driven mainly by an increase in support among female voters. In an analysis for FiveThirtyEight in September, Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux found that Warren’s polling for most of the campaign had been about three points higher among women than men. In a reversal, our survey has Warren as the first choice of 29 percent of men and 26 percent of women.

AD

AD

That suggests that an increase in the support of male voters is responsible for at least part of Warren’s recent trajectory. And the shift of the men’s vote may have come at Biden’s expense. Although Thomson-DeVeaux’s analysis found Biden polling roughly equally with men and women, in our survey he is at 22 percent among women but just 15 percent among men.

Of course, this one poll is a snapshot, and the state of the race remains fluid. But as the candidates take the debate stage Tuesday night, the recent news for Warren certainly appears favorable, especially as Biden and Sanders continue to contend with distractions on the campaign trail.

Ezekiel: I don’t think we can. The cost to her not answering the question is not that high.

Josh: We know exactly what Warren is doing: She wants to compete with Bernie for leftist voters who care about Medicare for All without taking any responsibility for the unpopular things she would have to do to get it implemented. It is frankly dishonest. Although the main direction the dishonesty goes is that she knows the financing is too unpopular to get done, yet she is pretending she will implement single-payer.

She’s not lying to me. She’s lying to socialists. Whereas Bernie forthrightly intends to make a forthright run at single-payer (which he will lose).

Eric: The thing is, she’s also embraced a ton of really unpopular stuff forthrightly. Decriminalizing border enforcement, reparations, a fracking ban — all more unpopular than M4A when taxes are mentioned, if I’m not mistaken.

Sarah: Fracking ban is way more unpopular.

Ezekiel: There’s not going to be a Medicare for All bill on her desk to sign in the first place.

After a period of relative quiescence following the publication of her last book, What Happened, in 2017, Hillary Clinton has again boosted her media presence to promote a children’s collection, The Book of Gutsy Women, co-written with her daughter Chelsea. Unfortunately for anyone with lingering 2016 PTSD, many of the breakout moments of her comeback tour have revolved around her former opponent.

It began on October 9, when Clinton responded to a presidential tweet goading her to “enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren” on the condition that she “must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!” She countered, simply, with:

Don’t tempt me. Do your job. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 8, 2019

It was the strongest Trump-related missive of the tour: a short, direct response to a wide-ranging attack that contrasted her professionalism with the president’s usual behavior. If only that tone had been maintained. In an interview with Jane Pauley of CBS News, Clinton called Trump a “corrupt human tornado,” which New York’s Sarah Jones called a “hamfisted attempt to clown on the president.” (More substantively, Clinton also dismissed Joe Biden’s history of unwanted touching, telling people to “get over it.”) And on Sunday, Clinton debuted the newest phase in her singular career — posting bad memes to troll the president. Responding to Trump’s objectively stupid letter to Turkish president Recep Erdogan, Clinton posted a rendering made by Jimmy Kimmel Live! of what Trump’s language might look like in historical context.

It was an unnecessary miss, unlike, say, Elizabeth Warren’s tweet responding to Jacob Wohl’s latest absurdity. Though the president constantly deploys profanity as well as horrid sexual imagery, Clinton, to her credit as a candidate, didn’t stoop to his verbal level — nor did any Democrats want her to. But thanks to this cursed tweet, now there’s a direct visual connection between the 2016 popular-vote winner and the phrase “busting my nuts.”

Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images

Ben: Pete Buttigieg has long been quite strong in Iowa polling, and a new survey out today continues that trend — according to USA Today/Suffolk, he’s within striking distance of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, with 13 percent, five points from Biden’s lead, though 29 percent of caucusgoers say they’re undecided. With the likelihood that he’ll do well — maybe very well — in Iowa growing, but with his lack of traction among black voters showing few signs of improving, does he have a legitimate path to winning the Democratic nomination?

Ed: Yeah, though it’s a narrow one with a lot of factors beyond his control.

Sarah: I’m not willing to discount him completely, but while it’s possible that he has a path, realistically it’s a difficult one.

Ed: The path I discern involves Biden beginning to struggle (which we’ve all been waiting for throughout the invisible primary season) at the same time Buttigieg is killing off all those other Biden-alternative candidacies in Iowa. The latter looks entirely possible; not sure Beto, Booker, Harris, or Klobuchar are going to get out of Iowa alive. If Biden really declines quickly, you could have a weird Buttigieg-Warren-Sanders fight pretty early, and none of them exactly has a corner on minority voters (though Bernie’s doing better this year than he did early on in 2016). I’d put my money on Warren in that scenario, but Pete would have a chance.

Ben: Buttigieg is clearly trying to position himself as the moderate alternative to Biden, as Ed said. At the last debate, he was aggressive in his criticism of Elizabeth Warren’s fuzziness on how to pay for Medicare for All. In the process, he seems to have turned off some progressives, who were already suspicious of him. A report today that Mark Zuckerberg gave him recommendations on political hires has only furthered the impression on the left that he can’t be trusted to tackle the issues they care about. Buttigieg seems to be betting that he does not need this bloc of voters in his corner — is that a good bet from a political standpoint?

Sarah: He needs them to win the primary, at least, so no, I don’t think it’s a good bet. I also think it’s important to understand exactly why left voters object to his closeness with Zuckerberg — it’s not all due to their belief that Facebook is a monopoly that should be broken up. It’s business as usual. People who wouldn’t call themselves socialists or even liberals are tired of it. Buttigieg is close to CEOs right when public opinion seems to have shifted firmly against corporate America and in favor of policies like a wealth tax, which target executives like Zuckerberg. It’s potentially a weakness for him with the very working-class voters he says the Democratic Party needs to recruit

Ed: Yeah, I don’t really understand why Pete would want to associate himself with Zuckerberg, and if I were him, I’d try to be the Non-Corporate Moderate in the race. He can raise money without relying on Wall Street and Silicon Valley. I’ve even been willing to argue that to some extent Buttigieg might be able to pull off a sort of centrism-plus-identity appeal like the last two Democratic presidential nominees, though obviously, there aren’t as many LGBTQ Democratic primary voters as there are feminists or African-Americans. But this is a bad moment to be Mr. Wall Street.

Ben: One thing that has distinguished his candidacy, though — especially considering what a long shot he was at the start — is how much money he’s brought in. He’s got an impressive campaign war chest, with a lot of money coming from small donors, but a lot also coming from the kind of corporate interests Warren and Bernie Sanders have shunned. The cash has allowed him to mount a major campaign apparatus in Iowa, including running TV ads, and it seems to be making a mark. Do voters who like his articulateness and what they see as pragmatism care so much about this aspect of the campaign that shutting off the spigot to Silicon Valley and Wall Street would be worth it?

Sarah: Maybe not in Iowa, but elsewhere, maybe? I think we put too much stock in Iowa, generally.

Ben: It is true that there’s quite a history of people winning it, then not going on to sustain the momentum.

Sarah: All I’d say is that Clinton’s own identity-plus-centrism appeal to voters did not work out well for her in the general, and I think it’s fair to blame that failure in part on the public’s perception of her as a moneyed elitist.

Ed: You may be right, but we will all argue until the end of time about which of Clinton’s problems was most important. And look, I am about as credentialed a career centrist as anyone you will meet, but while I don’t think it has any general-election magic associated with it any more, you can make a good case that Democratic primary voters still feel that way.

As for Iowa, as I noted earlier, its influence depends on who does and doesn’t survive it.

It very nearly knocked HRC right out of the 2008 race; if she hadn’t pulled off the NH upset five days later, it would have.

Ben: One thing we haven’t heard much about Buttigieg is his suitability in a general election. Biden’s perceived strength against Trump is one of his campaign’s central planks, and Sanders and Warren have arguments on their side, too — that they’ll spur enthusiasm among the young and/or among people who are usually not that politically engaged. Does Buttigieg have a particular electability argument one way or the other? He is very young and also gay, which would be a first for a presidential nominee. Do you have any sense of how those factors would play out if he were to win?

Sarah: It’s really hard to say. I’m sure he’s banking on centrism as a way to win over white working-class voters, but again, that didn’t work out for Clinton, and I don’t think it will necessarily work out for anyone else.

Ed: I certainly don’t have the imagination to quite envision a general-election contest between someone as articulate as Buttigieg and the troglodyte in the White House.

I do worry that despite all the “Trump proves you don’t need a resume” talk, Pete’s tenure as mayor of a small city is a problem, particularly since about all we know of it is his struggle with police-minority relations.

One small asset Buttigieg has in a general election — and it could be more important in the primaries — is that he’s a voice for religiously observant, white mainline Protestants, who, ironically, given their cultural dominance for much of American history, have all but vanished from public discourse in the battle between Evangelicals and the religiously unaffiliated.

Sarah: So was Clinton, arguably.

Ed: She hardly ever talked about it, though, much like Warren, who has a similar background. Pete does talk about it, a lot. Again, I wouldn’t overestimate this as an asset for Buttigieg, but it’s real.

Ben: Given his polling, fundraising, and attention surge, would you still call him a long shot at this point?

Sarah: Yeah, I do think that’s fair to say. I think he’s really running to be vice-president at this point.

Ed: You know, that was probably true earlier, and may be true again soon enough, but he does have an opening right now if he’s both skillful and very lucky. The key variable remains Biden. A lot of us fear Uncle Joe won’t fully exhibit the weakness we perceive in him until he’s the nominee."

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is hosting a major rally in Queensbridge Park in Long Island City on Saturday, which not only marks the Democratic presidential candidate’s return to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack in early October, but in which he’ll be joined for the first time by his new big-name endorser, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. As Intelligencer’s Gabriel Debenedetti noted in his preview of the event, with a little over three months remaining before voters begin weighing in on the Democratic primary race, the Sanders campaign hopes the “Bernie’s Back” rally will not only help counteract concerns about his health, but act “as a triumphant return to the trail just in time for the campaign to get serious.”

Below are updates and images from the rally, which got started at 1 p.m., and, according to Sanders, surpassed the 20,000-person limit the campaign was allowed on their permit.

Sanders Celebrates AOC’s Impact, Declares “I am Back”

Sanders referenced Ocasio-Cortez several times during his speech on Saturday. After she introduced him, he praised the congresswoman and the speed in which she has become influential. “I’ve been around politics a few years,” the candidate explained, “and it is hard to believe the degree to which in less than one year, this woman, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress — it is hard to believe the degree to which she has transformed politics in America.”

""For 45 years, there has been a class war waged against working families by the billionaire class and the corporate elite,"" @BernieSanders says.



He calls @AOC an ""inspiration"" to millions of ""young people"" and says he will travel with her throughout the country — Ross Barkan (@RossBarkan) October 19, 2019

Later Sanders said that he looked forward to “traveling with [AOC] all over this country.”

It came as no surprise that Sander’s also emphasized how ready he was to keep campaigning after taking more than two weeks off following his heart attack.

“I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready, more ready than ever to carry on with you the epic struggle that we have today,” Sanders told his supporters. “I am more than ready to assume the office of President of the United States. I am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elites and their apologists.”

“To put it bluntly, I am back.”

Another theme throughout Sanders speech was diversity, which clearly reflects one of the ways his campaign hopes to build more support in the coming months.

Sanders' closing remarks from his #BernieIsBackRally in Queens, NY:

He also criticized — at least generally — some of his moderate rivals for how they had painted his (and Elizabeth Warren’s) policy proposals as unrealistic at last week’s debate.

Ocasio-Cortez Shared Her Sanders-Centered Origin Story

Before an enthusiastic hometown crowd, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made her first official appearance in support of Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign, or at least as a congresswoman and left-liberal icon. Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Sanders’s campaign in 2016, and explained how — thanks to Sanders and that experience — a “sexually harassed waitress in downtown Manhattan” became an elected member of the U.S. Congress.

“It wasn’t until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,” she told rallygoers. She also noted that Sanders’s 2016 campaign provided a model for her own, adding that she was “proud to say the only reason I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved you can run a grassroots campaign and win in an America where we almost thought it was impossible.”

Ocasio-Cortez challenged and defeated longtime New York City congressman Joe Crowley in 2018 (but did not receive an endorsement from Sanders in that race).

“The halls of Congress are no joke,” the freshman Democrat insisted on Saturday. “Standing up to corporate power, and established interests is no joke. It’s not just about standing up and saying these things, but behind closed doors, your arm is twisted, the vise of political pressure gets put on you, every trick in the book, psychological, and otherwise is to get us to abandon the working class.” Understanding that dynamic firsthand, she continued, has made her “appreciate the enormous, consistent, and nonstop advocacy” Sanders offers even more.

Ohio Democrat, progressive organizer, and Sanders campaign national co-chair Nina Turner deployed some criticism at Sanders’s main rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden.

But Turner also falsely said that Sanders was the only candidate who was asked about age during Tuesday’s debate — Biden and Warren were also asked to respond to concerns about their age.

Bernie Sanders had heart surgery Tuesday night after experiencing pain in his chest at a campaign event earlier in the day, senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement Wednesday. The 78-year-old Sanders had a blockage in one artery and had two stents inserted. He is now “conversing and in good spirits,” the statement said. All of his events and appearances have been canceled until further notice, and the campaign has reportedly begun canceling ad buys in Iowa, where it was due to begin airing its first TV ads of the campaign.

Sanders was hospitalized in Las Vegas, where he was due to appear at a gun-violence forum hosted by March for Our Lives and the Giffords group. He was due to visiting California later this week, followed by a trip to Iowa this weekend, the Times reported.

The oldest candidate in the race, Sanders was recently asked by Stephen Colbert about voters who may have concerns over his age. “I’m in good health and running a vigorous campaign,” he said after knocking on Colbert’s desk.

The full statement from Weaver reads: “During a campaign event yesterday evening, Sen. Sanders experienced some chest discomfort. Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.”

After news of Sanders’s procedure, his fellow Democratic candidates sent their well wishes.

In a tweet, Joe Biden sent his best wishes, adding, “Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.”

Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.”

Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and others also tweeted their well wishes for the Vermont senator. So too did Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director. “All of us at @TeamTrump offer @BernieSanders,” he tweeted.

On Wednesday afternoon, Sanders tweeted that he’s “feeling good,” and underscored a central campaign message, reiterating his call for Medicare for All.

Thanks for all the well wishes. I'm feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover.



None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All! — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 2, 2019

On Thursday, the campaign confirmed that Sanders will participate in the debate on October 15, and released an update stating that “there has been no need for additional procedures” following the initial surgery.

It’s been a sub-rosa issue throughout the earliest phases of the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination competition. But aside from a not-very-clear generational challenge by Eric Swalwell in the very first debate to Joe Biden to “pass the torch,” and a snide comment by Julián Castro in the September debate that suggested Biden had experienced a senior moment, the age issue hasn’t come up all that much.

It took a Bernie Sanders heart attack to make the age and health of candidates an issue that moderators would raise and that debate viewers would have to think about in an informed way. Citing the candidate’s current age (78), Erin Burnett asked Sanders how he would reassure voters he was up to the job. As the Los Angeles Times reported, that led to a frank exchange involving the septuagenarians in the race:

“Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we’re having in Queens, N.Y.,” Sanders said, before promising a special guest and touting his website. “We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country that … I think can reassure the American people.”

Turns out Sanders was alluding to an endorsement he’s about to get from a progressive icon from the other end of the generational spectrum:

at @BernieSanders's Queens rally, and is expected to support him for president.🚨https://t.co/H1I9woghzG — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) October 16, 2019

As someone who has openly worried for a long time that Sanders and Biden might be too old to serve as viable challengers to Donald Trump, I’d observe that Sanders was very effective in this debate — possibly more effective than the old pre-heart attack Sanders who tended to shout ever more loudly in events like this one. But Burnett asked the question to the other seniors in the field:

“One of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and experience — with it comes wisdom,” Biden said, adding that he would release his medical records before the first voting occurred in February.

And she also asked Warren, whose age (70) may have come as a surprise to people who hadn’t heard about it:

Warren, who is frequently seen sprinting to the stage at her events, added that age was less important than providing an ambitious plan to attract the American electorate. But she also pointed to her vigor. “I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” Warren said.

This rare reference to the possibility that Trump could be removed from office or might resign was striking. And when Tulsi Gabbard was brought in as a representative of younger candidates (at 38, she’s a bit older than Pete Buttigieg), she trained her fire on the incumbent’s age and unfitness. So nobody got damaged by the age issue in this debate, and nobody got in a telling dig, either.

What’s unclear is whether viewers (who may not know how old the candidates actually are) had eyebrows raised by this high-profile airing of the subject, and could have second thoughts about their preferences. Let’s hope it doesn’t take another candidate’s health crisis to get voters thinking about, and becoming comfortable with, the risks associated with eliminating the sort of informal age cap that before Ronald Reagan kept candidates below the retirement age more or less out of the presidential sweepstakes, unless they were already in the White House."

FiveThirtyEight’s Perry Bacon Jr. posed a question this week that might have chilled the bones of progressives while thrilling centrists. It’s one that is asked of presidential candidates from both parties if an approaching general election is perceived as highly competitive, as 2020’s is expected to be:

Several of Joe Biden’s top rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary are presenting themselves as more liberal on policy issues than the former vice-president. But if Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris were to win the nomination, would they reposition themselves to appeal to more centrist voters in a general election?

It’s a question that in the not-too-distant past would have been answered affirmatively by most Democrats and some Republicans (the latter being more circumspect about arousing the suspicions of conservative ideologues forever trying to identify and purge RINOs, or Republicans In Name Only). No one would be as blatant as 2012 Mitt Romney communications director Eric Fehrnstrom:

[W]hen Mr. Fehrnstrom on Wednesday reached for a word to describe how Mr. Romney might pivot to the general election, the one that came tumbling from his mouth was “Etch A Sketch,” the children’s drawing toy in which nothing is ever permanent.

“Everything changes,” Mr. Fehrnstrom, 50, said on CNN, with a slight smirk that suggested he believed he was about to use a clever line. “It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.”

Conservatives who thought most of their policy positions came down from the Founders, if not from God Almighty, were not amused, and it exacerbated Romney’s reputation for being an unprincipled opportunist. And it’s the sort of thing Democratic progressives might fear in an ideologically anodyne candidate like Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg. In their struggle to challenge Elizabeth Warren’s progressive credentials, you can imagine Bernie Sanders supporters fanning fears that the Massachusetts senator might “move to the center” if nominated. She is, after all, a Democrat, not a Democratic Socialist, the self-identification that pretty much precludes any “move to the center” by Bernie if it involves changing policy positions (many of which he’s had for decades).

But as Bacon observes, a nomination winner’s efforts to expand her base of support heading into a general election can be accomplished in ways other than changing policy positions or adopting new ones designed to appeal to “centrists” or “swing voters.”

[L]ike with past nominees, it will be easier for these candidates to present themselves as more moderate in a general election through shifts in tone and their vice-presidential picks rather than moving right on policy.

They can also, I would add, emphasize a different mix of the positions, or biographical features, that they already possess to appeal to voters who aren’t in the party’s “base.” And that sometimes means forgetting about the increasingly dubious idea that swing voters are “centrist.” If you think about it for a minute, a party nominee might best emphasize his most popular policy ideas, which may be “centrist” but could just as easily be “progressive” by conventional terms; examples of the latter include free college, expanded Social Security benefits, wealth taxes, and nationalist trade policies. Indeed, a smart general-election strategy for a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren might be to choose policies and messages that rev up progressives but at the same time appeal to swing voters. Those do exist.

The base-energizing factor speaks to another issue of general-election strategy: Campaigns must calculate to what extent their winning strategy depends on mobilization as opposed to persuasion. A lot of progressives believe non-voters skew heavily in their direction, on the theory that under-voting demographic groups like millennials are disproportionately progressive, and/or haven’t viewed the two-party choice as sufficiently clear. So creating an ideologically polarized general-election atmosphere will boost turnout among both the partisan base and previous non-voters, without any “moving to the center” at all.

Now something Democrats may have to contend with is the very high probability that the Trump 2020 campaign and the GOP will campaign against the nominee as an infanticide-supporting, anti-American, business-hating socialist, forcing Democrats into the false choice of either implicitly confirming those characterizations or pushing off them in a way that may discourage the Democratic base. A GOP campaign of insane negativity and unprincipled smears would be the perfectly predictable Trump M.O., and it also could work, as Hillary Clinton’s overconfident 2016 campaign learned.

How different candidates plan to deal with that challenge is a legitimate issue for primary voters, along with their plans to deal with a still-powerful Republican Party if they win. Everything we know about Sanders and his supporters suggests that he intends to overwhelm Trump by mobilizing a hidden majority that’s been waiting to support a progressive “political revolution” all along. Warren and other left-bent candidates may be more strategically flexible. And Biden, of course, has hitched his wagon to the older idea of “moving to the center” as a way to persuade swing voters. Even if you think (as I do) that this is an outmoded way of thinking that sacrifices too much ideological turf, if a majority of Democratic primary voters think that way, it could lift the former veep to the nomination, if not the presidency."

But it could have been so much better. Here’s my Wednesday-morning quarterbacking of what would have helped both in the debate planning and execution.

1. Including questions about climate change and voting rights. Granted, the time was limited (though hardly short), but these are two of the most crucial issues of our time. And they are sorely underexplored on the debate stage in this political season. Did the rehashing of Medicare-for-all and gun control really need — again — to take up so much time at the expense of so much that needs to be fully aired? Binyamin Appelbaum, a Times editorial writer, expressed the exasperation of many: “No questions about climate change. Zero. Zip. Nada.” The absence was appalling.

2. Framing the (apparently unavoidable) question about universal health care and how to fund it in a non-gotcha way. Journalists are kindly doing President Trump’s work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the new front-runner, to declare she’d raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-all. Of course, it’s legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad, and misses the larger lens of overall costs. (Warren, notably, refused to take the bait.)

AD

AD

3. Having fewer candidates onstage. It was a relief to have the field tightened from the last round — as my 20-something daughter drolly acknowledged when she asked me, mid-debate, if I was missing John Hickenlooper. (No, I did not pine for the former Colorado governor, nor former Maryland congressman John Delaney, and couldn’t shed a tear for Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, either.)

Still: 12? At one debate? That never had a chance of being workable, and it wasn’t. One third fewer (just like the calories in light food) would have brought it down to a far more manageable eight, and this viewer could have done without — for example — hearing Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard repeat “regime change war” a dozen times during the foreign-policy discussion.

Having businessman Andrew Yang onstage, however, was delightful if only because of his MATH (Make America Think Harder) lapel pin. Billionaire Tom Steyer? Please.

AD

AD

4. Making it a tight two hours instead of a mind-numbing three. “This debate is so long that it contained an entire vaccine news cycle,” quipped BuzzFeed News Editor in Chief Ben Smith sometime in the final hour, tweeting a news story about the publicity around — and cancellation of — a Harlem event hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton’s civil rights organization that would have given credence to anti-vaccine viewpoints.

5. Eliminating the cringe-inducing last question. It was good, this time, not to have dull opening statements and closing statements. But the substitution, in the final minutes, of “tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us” was flat-out embarrassing.

A couple of candidates expounded on the late Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), well-known for reaching across the aisle — thus making the revelations something less than surprising. Others talked about someone they met on the campaign trail, which hardly seemed to amount to a friendship.

AD

AD

It didn’t help that the question was inspired by the recently hyped, thoroughly self-serving celebrity pseudo-friendship between comedian Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W. Bush.

Perhaps recognizing the hollowness at the heart of the question, many used their last-gasp moments more cannily: to remind viewers how to find their campaign websites.

On balance, the debate was reasonably substantive and useful. I’d even call it a public service, if a flawed one.

Luckily — if that’s the right word — there are eight more chances to get it right.

Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, urged Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump’s account for violating the service’s rules, while Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri is battling what he considers tech companies’ bias against conservatives. Hawley has also told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he should sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.

The companies are trying to maintain a neutral stance, even if that draws the ire of politicians as divergent as the president and those trying to impeach him. Behind the scenes, though, they are spending millions on lobbying in hopes of warding off breakups or intrusive regulation.

Not that there is any danger of either happening any time soon, especially with an ongoing impeachment probe. Still, talking up Big Tech’s problems has proven to be popular political rhetoric.

When it comes to policing content, social media services are “caught between a rock and a hard place,” said Andrew Guess, a Princeton University political scientist who studies social media and its effects on political opinion.

AD

Blocking or suspending accounts for hate speech can prompt complaints of political bias or censorship, but a hands-off approach may be viewed as a free pass to politicians like Trump.

AD

“Anything they do is going to attract criticism,” Guess said. “That, of course, makes them a target.”

Beyond discourse and privacy, antitrust concerns have emerged as a major concern for lawmakers and candidates. This wasn’t the case in 2016, when grumbling about the outsized power of tech was largely confined to activists and those on the most liberal end of the spectrum.

Leading the pack has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies. She garnered immediate support, even from rivals such as Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who retweeted Warren for what he said was the first time. Cruz said “she’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.”

AD

Since then, calling out the tech behemoths and other big corporations has been a pillar of Warren’s presidential campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders, another leading Democratic candidate, has also said breaking up Amazon, Google and Apple is “something we should definitely take a look at.”

AD

Still, while there have been congressional hearings, investigations and fines, including a record $5 billion against Facebook, little has changed for Big Tech.

A Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass legislation that seems too anti-business. That includes breaking up tech companies seen as too monopolistic. The same likely goes for any privacy law that restricts companies’ ability to target ads to their liking.

AD

While the two parties agree that Big Tech has problems, they often differ on what those problems are — and how to fix them. You won’t find many Democrats complaining about tech’s perceived conservative bias, for instance. Nor will you find many conservatives complaining of algorithmic bias against people of color.

Trump has been uneven in his criticisms. Amazon has been a frequent target, though that is due in part to CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post. He’s met with Zuckerberg privately, but he’s also tweeted that “Facebook was always anti-Trump” and accused it of colluding with the news media against him.

AD

Amid all this, at least in public, the companies have mostly kept a low profile. But there are occasional glimpses of behind-the-scenes activity. Leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting in July captured Zuckerberg acknowledging that if “someone like” Warren is elected, he expects Facebook to fight back — and prevail — against efforts to break it up in court. But he added: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah.”

AD

Amazon, by contrast, briefly tried to debate the candidates on Twitter.

In April, after Warren complained that Amazon and other big tech companies have “too much power,” the company responded by pointing the finger at its main rival: “Walmart is much larger; Amazon is less than 4% of U.S. retail.”

When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a TV interview in June that Amazon pays workers “starvation wages,” the company tweeted that she “is just wrong.”

AD

And Amazon gave former Vice President Joe Biden a corporate tax lesson after he tweeted that it shouldn’t be paying a “lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.”

“We pay every penny we owe,” Amazon tweeted back. “Congress designed tax laws to encourage companies to reinvest in the American economy. We have.”

AD

This was in June. Amazon seems to have backed off since.

Expect the political pushback to continue, from both parties, said Joshua Tucker, co-director of New York University’s Social Media and Political Participation Lab.

“It’s a bipartisan issue,” he said. “But the right and the left are criticizing it for different reasons.”

A new USA Today/Suffolk survey of Iowa is raising eyebrows today because it seems to confirm that Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge of support following his notable showing in last week’s candidate debate in Ohio:

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice-president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds.

Biden, long viewed as the Democratic front-runner, is faltering in the wake of a debate performance last week that those surveyed saw as disappointing.

The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18 percent, Warren at 17 percent and Buttigieg at 13 percent among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers.

The characterization of Biden as “faltering” after the last debate is a bit questionable, since his showing in the USAT/Suffolk survey is pretty much in line with most recent Iowa polling showing him more or less even with Warren in the state with other candidates trading positions in a tier just below them. For that matter, all four polls of Iowa taken in October (from USAT/Suffolk, Emerson, YouGov, and Firehouse Strategies/Optimus) before and after the Ohio debate have shown Mayor Pete in double digits. But this latest headline certainly reinforces the narrative Buttigieg wanted after changing his persona from the irenic, erudite peacemaker of the early going to the fighting moderate displayed in Westerville, as my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti explained after the debate:

This candidate, eager to look like a truth-teller and get in the mix as the bigger-name contenders wage ideological war, has sharper elbows than the version who has quietly been building up his Iowa operation in recent months. It’s all part of a bet he’s making that drawing these kinds of stark contrasts now — just as more voters tune in to the race and just as Warren surges — can position him to be an alternative to Joe Biden for moderate voters or at least vault him from the floor of the race’s top tier, alongside Kamala Harris, to somewhere in the vicinity of Bernie Sanders’s third-place status.

Iowa, of course (and New Hampshire, where Buttigieg is also doing pretty well in polls), is a state whose demographics do not penalize Mayor Pete for his poor standing with minority voters, especially the African-Americans who will dominate southern primaries beginning with South Carolina. This is a significant element of Biden’s base, and it’s unclear whether Buttigieg’s weakness there is attributable to his wine-track stylings, his not so great reputation among South Bend’s black activists, his openly gay sexual orientation, or a combination of factors. But if Mayor Pete is struggling a bit to break out of his demographic limitations, two of his competitors are in greater peril as Iowa polling shows. Both Harris (“I’m moving to f***ing Iowa”) and Cory Booker have heavily invested in Iowa, hoping to replicate Barack Obama’s 2008 strategy of impressing South Carolina’s majority-black primary electorate by proving viability among white voters in the early going. They’re both currently polling in the low single digits in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. The USAT/Suffolk survey was a particularly depressing bit of news for this pair of candidates: Harris, who was running a strong second to Biden in the previous USAT/Suffolk poll at the end of June, is now trailing Tom Steyer and is tied with Tulsi Gabbard, while Booker is in tenth place, behind Andrew Yang.

It’s tempting to say Harris and Booker badly need a breakthrough performance in the November debate in Atlanta, though with Booker, who has been relatively impressive in every debate, you have to wonder if even that would be enough to lift him into serious contention. And while endorsements usually don’t matter all that much in presidential contests, Buttigieg would likely benefit from the support of a high-profile African-American opinion leader. Maybe he can talk Oprah Winfrey out of her current preoccupation with convincing Disney exec Bob Iger to run."

Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate who’s rising most quickly in the polls, answered this question in September’s Democratic debate by calling for stronger protections for labor and the environment in U.S. trade agreements with other countries. Our research suggests this approach is popular with the U.S. public. Americans like free-trade deals, but they want the deals to come with protections.

U.S. trade deals usually have protections built in

Free-trade deals reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, but also usually end up protecting certain constituencies. For example, developed countries’ governments often include labor and environmental provisions in trade deals, which promote core international standards on collective bargaining, child labor and endangered species. Recent trade deals between developed countries (the global North) and developing countries (the global South) have included labor and environmental standards that are just as legally binding and enforceable as the other parts within the deals. Both labor and environmental provisions have been effective in improving living standards in developing countries that trade with the United States and the European Union.

Including labor and environmental protections in trade deals boosts popular support for free trade

These are the kinds of protections Warren wants more of. So what does the public think? Our latest article in the Review of International Organizations looks at survey evidence on what people think in the United States and other developed countries.

AD

AD

Our key finding is that the public in those countries is more likely to support free trade agreements when those pacts protect the environment and labor. That’s true among those who dislike free trade, either because they believe it makes them economically insecure or because they believe free trade is unethical, as it erodes human rights and harms the planet. Low-skilled workers, who see their jobs moved into lower-wage countries, like these provisions because they think the protections level economic competition. Highly skilled workers also like them because they think the provisions are fairer and help improve conditions for workers and the environment worldwide.

This suggests that politicians such as Warren may be able to sell new trade deals to the public in nations grappling with populist policymaking and economic nationalism. For example, boosting and promoting such provisions might help generate support for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which awaits congressional ratification.

More generally, trade deals may well be more attractive to skeptics in the global North if linked to such social protections. What’s more, such measures have a relatively low cost, as they require no changes domestically and aim instead to raise the standards in the global South. Expect other politicians besides Warren to turn to them to get trade agreements through.

They’re going to try to do it again. And they’re already getting started.

A new story about Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) early life is a perfect little case study in the strategy the right will use to defeat whichever Democrat wins their party’s presidential nomination. This one is probably not going to become the “But Her Emails” of 2020, but at this stage, Republicans are probably fine with that.

AD

AD

This is a process of trial and error: Throw out a hundred fake “scandals” and see which one captures people’s attention, then hammer it again and again in the hope it will become all people think of when they think of the Democrat. If there’s something actually scandalous there, that’s great, but if there isn’t, that’s okay, too.

Here’s how this particular experiment in scandal-mongering has gone. One of the stories Warren tells about herself, often when describing her desire to improve child care, is about how in her early 20s she was working as a schoolteacher in New Jersey. “But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant,” she said during a Democratic debate. “Back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me — wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

It was the 1970-71 school year, and in those days, it was not just common but often the express policy of many school districts — not to mention plenty of other employers — that women who became pregnant would have to be fired.

AD

AD

It wasn’t until 1974 that the Supreme Court ruled that policies forcing pregnant teachers out of the classroom were unconstitutional. In 1978, Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, but even today, discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace is distressingly widespread.

Yet this seemingly uncontroversial piece of Warren’s biography obviously made some opposition researcher somewhere begin poring over records of the school where Warren worked nearly half a century ago. The result was this article published Monday in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, in which they reveal — hold on to your hats — that the minutes of a school board meeting in April 1971 (when Warren would have been four months pregnant) say that her contract was renewed, while the minutes of a meeting two months later say that her resignation was “accepted with regret.”

To any sane person, this wouldn’t contradict her story at all, since it’s unlikely that the school board minutes would record “Fired Mrs. Warren for getting knocked up.” Nevertheless, the claim that Warren is pulling a fast one shot around the conservative world. Eventually the story reached into the mainstream media, with pieces like this CBS News article which corroborates her story but nonetheless frames it as “Elizabeth Warren stands by account,” as though there is some actual doubt about what happened.

AD

AD

How fake right-wing scandals work

On the most basic level, you’d have to ask who could possibly care about this. It’s hard to believe there are large numbers of voters who will say, “I know Trump is the most corrupt president in history and has told thousands of lies, but I’m not sure I can trust Elizabeth Warren if I can’t be convinced beyond any doubt that her story about leaving a job in 1971 is 100 percent true.”

But that’s not how it works. When the right creates a fake scandal about a Democratic politician, it isn’t meant to be persuasive in and of itself. It’s meant to do a couple of things at once. First, it gives Republican media figures, and the audiences of Fox News and talk radio, something to talk about to channel already existing antipathy.

AD

Next, it prods mainstream media to take up the story on their own, so that even if the story is debunked, the ensuing coverage still reinforces the narrative Republicans have created. Here are a thousand stories about whether Hillary Clinton is corrupt! Even if what they add up to is a public official who was not, in fact, corrupt, the question “How corrupt is Hillary Clinton?” came to define the campaign.

AD

They tried to do the same thing with Joe Biden and the Ukraine story, pushing a conspiracy theory that, though wrong in most ways, was bought by the conspiracy theorist in chief, the result being that he’s now likely to be impeached.

To repeat, I doubt that their attempt to create a scandal out of Warren’s pregnancy story will work. But between now and next November, they’ll float a hundred more stories like this one, for now about multiple candidates and then about the Democratic nominee. Each one will be shot out by their extremely effective propaganda system to see if it takes flight. As soon as one fails, they’ll move on to the next in the endless quest for another But Her Emails.

Tuesday, October 15, marked the deadline for presidential candidates to submit third-quarter fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission. Some got out ahead of the deadline by releasing their fundraising hauls early. Others, such as Wayne Messam, the little-known Democratic mayor of Miramar, Florida, and for some reason also a presidential candidate, did not.

But with the deadline comes full reports from all of the candidates and a clearer picture of where they stand, money-wise, 110 days before the Iowa caucuses. The top-line figure is total money raised and Bernie Sanders led in the third quarter by bringing in $25.2 million. His Senate colleague, Elizabeth Warren, was not far behind with $24.6 million. Pete Buttigieg surprised with $19.1 million, Joe Biden disappointed with $15.7 million, and Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with $11.7 million.

There are some other noteworthy nuggets buried in these reports, including:

Wayne Messam raised just $5.

You could have watched every minute of every presidential debate so far and never known that Messam is running for president. But he is. The mayor of Miramar, which is bigger than South Bend, reported raising just $5 in the third quarter. On the plus side, that’s five more dollars than he spent.

Joe Biden’s bank account is dwindling.

The former vice-president doesn’t just trail Senators Sanders and Warren in fundraising, he trails them in amount of money on hand. With $8.98 million in his bank account, Biden is also lagging behind Buttigieg and Harris.

Politico explains that the problem is tied to Biden’s reliance on big-money donors:

As Biden’s campaign spending picked up over the summer, his reliance on maximum donors — who can give only once and are not a renewable campaign resource — meant that his fundraising could not keep pace. More than one-third of Biden’s contributions came from maximum donors in the second quarter, and max-out donors composed a similar portion of a smaller pie for Biden this quarter.

That could also explain why Biden was underwater in the third quarter, spending nearly $2 million more than he brought in.

Ten candidates spent more than they brought in.

It’s never good when you spend more money than you make, and that’s what ten candidates did last quarter. But the candidate whose numbers were the most mismatched is Amy Klobuchar. The Minnesota senator spent $7.8 million and brought in $4.8 million. That’s good for a 162 percent burn rate.

Tom Steyer is his own biggest fan.

The California billionaire spent big in the third quarter after getting into the race in early July, dropping a staggering $47 million, a sum that the L.A. Times says “places him on track to join the biggest self-funding political candidates in American history.” The $47 million is nearly all of the $49.6 million that Steyer brought in during the third quarter. Who did the money come from? Nearly $1.5 million from small donors, a half million from large donors, and $47.6 million from Steyer himself."

Tuesday night marks the fourth debate on the primary calendar — meaning there are only eight more to go in the Democratic primary race. Unlike last month’s debate, the event on October 15 expands the field, with 12 candidates onstage, including one new challenger.

What Time Is the Democratic Debate?

Hosted by Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio, the festivities will start at 8 p.m. ET and drag on until 11 p.m.

What Channel has the Democratic Debate?

Co-hosted by CNN and the New York Times, the debate will be available for streaming — without requiring a cable-provider log-in — at CNN.com, the New York Times mobile app, and on Facebook.

What is the Democratic Debate Lineup?

The candidates will appear onstage, from left to right, as follows:

Tulsi Gabbard

Tom Steyer

Cory Booker

Kamala Harris

Bernie Sanders

Joe Biden

Elizabeth Warren

Pete Buttigieg

Andrew Yang

Beto O’Rourke

Amy Klobuchar

Julián Castro

Like last debate, Biden is flanked by the two progressives closest in the polls; unlike last debate, Warren has surpassed the former vice-president in at least one poll, making his front-runner status no longer unanimous.

How’d They Decide Who Made the Cut?

To qualify for the debate, the Democratic National Committee determined that Democrats had to receive contributions from a minimum of 130,000 donors and had to register at least 2 percent of support in four DNC-approved polls. Because the qualifications did not increase in difficulty between September and October, candidates had more time to reach the donation and polling requirements — thus, the inclusion of Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire impeachment enthusiast Tom Steyer.

Who Are the Moderators for the Democratic Debate?

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, CNN anchor Erin Burnett, and New York Times national editor Mark Lacey.

The I-Word Looming Over the Debate

A drastic political change has occurred since the last debate: House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into the president’s quid pro quo pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of the former vice-president’s son Hunter Biden. And though a potential impeachment proceeding could benefit Democrats in the long run — just over half of voters support the president’s removal, according to a recent Fox News poll — the scandal will be complicate the debate, as New York’s Ed Kilgore notes:

In talking about Trump and impeachment, the candidates vying to become his vanquisher in November 2020 are in the awkward position of discussing and promoting an event that would make their own competition wildly different if not irrelevant. What are they supposed to do? Boast of how they will tear Mike Pence a new one? Make the general election a referendum on why it took Republicans so long to abandon their corrupt leader? It’s a tough set of questions — again, for moderators as well as for debaters.

If any of the debaters … go after Hunter [Biden], his father could very well exploit the moment to depict himself as the victim of an infamous Trump smear, and also as the candidate Trump fears enough to risk impeachment to smear. Suffice it to say there is some nervous debate prep under way on the subject.

When Is the Next Democratic Debate?

Held on Wednesday, November 20, in Georgia and hosted by MSNBC, the threshold for the next debate went up, as candidates will have to clear 3 percent in at least four national polls — or polls in early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina — in addition to 160,000 donors. Despite the raised admission point, the debate will still be packed: Candidates who have made the fifth debate thus far include Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Steyer, Warren, and Yang."

Ben: Today, Senator Kamala Harris wrote a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey requesting that he ban President Trump from the platform, citing his efforts to “target, harass, and attempt to out the whistle-blower” who has lodged a complaint against him, and his suggestion that his removal from the presidency will lead to a civil war, among other things. Regardless of the political wisdom of this idea — Harris is struggling mightily in the polls and this seems like a bid for some attention — does it make any sense to you?

Max: I mean, sure, it makes sense. She’s right; he’s pretty obviously in violation of Twitter policy and has been for years.

Ben: Yeah, this is a frequent complaint lodged by a lot of people. But is it actually a good idea?

Max: Ha. For whom?

Ben: Society?

Brian: My attitude about Trump’s use of Twitter mirrors a lot of how I think about stuff like deepfakes: Whether it’s effective is based on whether it’s amplified by other important people/outlets. So would people stop repeating the president’s wild rants if he had to do it on, I dunno, Facebook? Probably not.

Ben: I think there’s a difference here: He’s the president, so anything he says is newsworthy, unfortunately — unlike a deepfake, which could just go unremarked upon.

Brian: Right. I guess that’s my point. Shutting down the account wouldn’t dull any tensions. Would I love to see it happen? Sure. But I can’t imagine it would have a calming effect.

Max: Yeah, I think I agree with Feldman to the extent that “banning Trump from Twitter” seems like a poor stand-in for some more consequential response. I don’t really think Trump derives as much power from Twitter as I think the call to ban him supposes.

I think society might be marginally better off if he were banned, but, as Feldman is saying, Twitter is just one component of a media ecosystem that has been pretty effectively and thoroughly bent around Trump.

Brian: I think there is a slight belief that if we knock out Trump’s Twitter account, he’ll be crippled somehow. It’s a very naïve, “out of sight out of mind” mentality. He’ll just call into Fox & Friends or call a friendly reporter on background. He’s got plenty of allies willing to amplify his message if he can’t do it himself. Again, I’d love to see tech companies that claim to care about toxicity and stuff put their money where their mouth is, but in the case of the president, it feels pretty pointless.

Ben: Okay, so narrowing the scope of the argument a bit: If it won’t make a difference in terms of what the president puts out, does Twitter not have a responsibility to enforce its rules? I think many would cheer banning Trump, not because it will actually turn down the volume of his awfulness but because it would send a message that his conduct is not fit for a prominent communications platform.

Max: I think Twitter has a responsibility to enforce its rules, yeah. But Twitter also has the ability to change it rules in whatever ways it sees fit. The “rules” thing is what Kendra Albert calls a “legal talisman” — we like to talk about the “rules” of platforms as though they take the same shape as laws in the context of a government or a state.

It’s not like Twitter is great at cleanup now. It doesn’t really feel hypocritical that the prez remains when, like, heinous accounts remain all over. He’s not an outlier is all I mean, maybe in stature but not behavior.

Ben: Yes, they’re famously bad at this.

Breaking news: Elizabeth Warren was asked about this very question just now, per this tweet:

REPORTER: “Should Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?”

ELIZABETH WARREN: [laughs] “No.”

Max: I think Warren has the right idea. It’s hard for me to gin up much anger at Twitter over this specific thing. “Twitter inconsistently applies its own company policy” seems relatively minor in the scheme of problems in how “the media” — as a kind of overall ecosystem — deals with Trump. And I think trying to isolate Twitter, its relationship to Trump’s personal account, and its deployment of its policies … I don’t know, it seems kind of narrow-minded at best. Sorry, I know “eh, shrug” is not the kind of invigorating intellectual debate we might want, but I think it’s the one we deserve.

Brian: Once Congress makes it so that Twitter poll results are legally binding contracts, then it’s time to worry.

Ben: Presumably you don’t think there’s a chance Twitter would ever follow through on this? What if he specifically directed people to go after, say, Adam Schiff? This hardly seems out of the realm of possibility.

Brian: They’re both public figures — they live for drama. Remember when that support guy deactivated the account for like 11 minutes? That was so funny. So I guess now I support it because it’d be a good troll.

Max: I guess the problem I have with that hypothetical is, like (I’m thinking out loud here, don’t hold me to this), do we really think Schiff would suddenly be in more danger than normal if Trump tweeted, I don’t know, “Get Adam Schiff”?

Ben: Yeah, I do.

Max: Maybe I am underrating the power of DJT or the power of Twitter, or maybe I’m just a callous old troll. But my general feeling about the threat that Trump poses is that it’s generalized and diffuse and occurs along a bunch of different vectors.

And that the kind of hypothetical, like, “Well, what if he incited violence in a tweet?” question sort of misses the forest for the trees. I’m just interrogating my own instinctive response.

Ben: I see your point — it’s just that the violation in this case would be SO blatant I think Twitter might have to do something. It’s kind of like impeachment: There was enough there before this Ukraine thing, but this was just so comically corrupt that inaction was not an option.

Max: Yeah, impeachment a good comparison, Ben. I guess where the analogy continues for me is in the way that, by rights, he should have been banned years ago! So it’s hard to take any sort of “judicial process” around it seriously.

Ben: So let’s just not try.

Max: Haha. Well, okay, if we’re talking about impeachment and Twitter, maybe I’d say: To me, there aren’t several specific crimes here that mean he should or should not be impeached or banned. There’s one big overall problem, which is that he’s manifestly corrupt and unfit for office. Actually, I take it back. Maybe this doesn’t get us anywhere. Sorry, it’s turning out I have less of an opinion about this than I actually even thought. I guess I do sort of think he should be banned, but I truly can’t bring myself to care enough to make a strong case for it!

Ben: This is the kind of strong conviction people look for when they turn to Intelligencer.

Max: I think more than anything it just speaks to how badly Harris must be doing that she’s picking this up as her issue.

Ben: Yes.

Brian: In the face of a zillion important anti-Trump causes, his use of Twitter does not rank highly even for me, an idiot who has to think about Twitter too much."
341,Paul Waldman,"Unfortunately, Warren missed the opportunity to clarify not just what she supports but why the attacks on her are so misconceived.
Some time ago, Warren made a decision to refuse to answer one very specific question, the one Marc Lacey of the New York Times … [+5909 chars]",She could have explained why « taxes are inherently bad » is such a damaging premise to accept.,2019-10-16,The Washington Post,What Elizabeth Warren should have said about Medicare-for-all,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/16/what-elizabeth-warren-should-have-said-about-medicare-for-all/,"I understand that you’re trying to get me to say the words “Taxes will go up,” because then everyone can say how politically dangerous it is. So let’s talk about taxes and health care. It’s simple: Taxes are what we pay, as a country, to get what we want. We want a military to defend us, so we pay taxes. We want air traffic controllers to keep planes from flying into each other, so we pay taxes. We want national parks, and medical research, and roads and bridges and police and firefighters and schools, so we pay taxes.

And just as we decided that every child deserves an education so we created a school system, we can and should decide that every American deserves health coverage, so we’ll create a national health system — one where nobody goes without coverage because they can’t afford it, nobody goes bankrupt because they got sick, nobody avoids going to the doctor because their company’s plan has a big deductible, and all the anxiety and fear around paying for health care is just not something we have to deal with anymore.

Of course taxes are going to pay for it, just like they pay for all those other things we decided we want. Why is it that we act as though it’s an awful thing to pay for health coverage with taxes, but it’s somehow better if we all pay even more to corporations making profits off us?

If you think that whether somebody’s taxes go up or down is more important than whether the total cost they pay for health care goes up or down, you can’t pretend you actually care about their pocketbooks. You’re just playing a game, a game whose rules were written by Republicans.

In this case they’re determined to keep the wealthy from contributing their fair share while the rest of us empty our wallets so insurance companies can keep making billions in profits, but it’s how they keep us from addressing all kinds of pressing problems. They always say the same thing: “We can’t do that — we might have to pay for it with taxes!” It’s the wrong question. The right questions are what we want to do, how it should work, and whether the tax system is fair.

That’s why I won’t answer that question the way you want me to."
342,Paul Waldman,"Now Warren has announced that she will be putting out her health-care plan in the next few weeks.

It’s hard to see how she’ll solve it.

Up until recently, Warren had seemed open to multiple approaches to achieve universal coverage and control costs. Although she co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’s single-payer plan in the Senate, she also co-sponsored other, more modest proposals (that’s true of other candidates, including Sanders himself).

But eventually Warren began speaking more firmly about her support for Medicare-for-all. Even if it’s a term with various definitions, she made clear her belief that insurance companies are at the center of what ails the system. They extract billions in profits while adding no value to anyone. And they do it, as Warren often points out, by collecting as much as possible in premiums and paying out as little as possible in claims.

At a different time, those ideas might still have left flexibility to take a number of approaches. The problem Warren faces is that within the Democratic Party, what used to be a lefty proposal — the creation of a widely available public option resembling Medicare or Medicaid — has now become the conservative position. The candidates espousing it — Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar — are now attacking Warren from the right.

A couple of years ago, Warren could have said, “I support Medicare-for-all, which is why we should create a public option now, and over time, more people will migrate to it from private insurance. The transition will be less disruptive than if we did it all at once.” That wouldn’t have been seen as contradictory.

But now, saying that — especially since it’s basically what Buttigieg says — would be seen as a sellout and a flip-flop. Warren has seemingly been trapped into proposing something more closely resembling Sanders’s plan, not just by what she has said but by the way the rest of the field has moved.

That’s what happened to Kamala D. Harris. She’d said some of the same things as Warren about insurance companies. But when she released her plan — which would allow private insurers to compete with a government plan and so essentially universalize Medicare as it is now and not as it is in Sanders’s enormously generous vision (which is “Medicare-for-all” in the same way a Lexus LC500 is a Toyota Corolla) — it was greeted with contempt from the right and the left.

Warren could face the same problem. About a year and a half ago, Democrats all started saying they wanted Medicare-for-all, but they were using the term to refer to both single-payer and public option plans. Then pollsters began asking about it, and it turned out public option plans are much more popular.

AD

AD

The most important reason for this is loss aversion — people are afraid of losing what they have even if they’ll get something better in exchange and react positively to choice. There are plenty of arguments as to why single payer is actually superior, but few believe the public will grasp the nuances.

Before, the political advantages of public option plans weren’t clear. Now they are. That’s Warren’s dilemma: How can she offer something true to what she has said until now and doesn’t open her up to attacks that prey on the public’s fear of losing their insurance?

I honestly have no idea. But meanwhile, let’s keep a couple of things in mind.

The first is that the media’s incessant focus (and that of a couple of the candidates) on whether taxes will be raised on the middle class to fund Medicare-for-all is utterly inane. The whole point is moving from a system in which trillions of dollars are shunted through insurance companies to one in which that money moves through the government — minus what the insurance companies take for themselves.

AD

AD

When Warren says that what matters is the cost people pay and not whether it goes toward taxes or premiums, she’s exactly right. According to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, the typical family of four with employer-sponsored coverage now spends $12,500 a year on health care, plus $1,450 in Medicare taxes, plus $13,050 that their employer contributes, for a total of $27,000 dollars in total costs.

The idea that it would be somehow worse to pay more in taxes while paying less in premiums and co-pays is both absurd and dishonest.

The second is that that we in the media judge Democrats and Republicans by wildly different standards when evaluating this kind of policy proposal. Donald Trump’s 2016 health-care plan consisted of “Everybody’s going to be taken care of, much better than they’re taken care of now.” It was gibberish, but the media pretty much let it slide.

AD

AD

Even before its release, Warren’s plan is being treated as though cost is the only thing that matters. But the far more important questions include: How will this work? What will the effects be on providers? How long will the transition be? How does Warren plan to overcome the opposition of wealthy interests? What will it mean for our economy and quality of life when everyone is covered and no one ever has to fight with an insurance company again?

Those are the questions we should be asking. I hope she has some good answers.

Ben: As President Trump and his allies launch attack after attack on Joe Biden and his family over their ties to Ukraine, baselessly accusing him of orchestrating the firing of a prosecutor there to protect his son, the Democratic contender has been fairly mild in his response. He has criticized Trump for the broadsides but not consistently, so the public may be left with the impression that he’s not fighting back very aggressively. Biden’s strategy, born in part out of his wish not to get dragged down to Trump’s level and in part by his wish not to involve his son further in all of this, has left some allies baffled, as the New York Times reported over the weekend. What does it say about his readiness to take on Trump in what would undoubtedly be a vicious general-election campaign?

Ed: Oh, I dunno. Biden will have plenty of time to fight back. Maybe looking like the victim is his strategy right now. The bigger question is whether the whole brouhaha will hurt him whether or not he’s pugilistic about it all. It’s kind of a three-fer: He’s in the news in a negative way just as he’s bleeding support to a surging Elizabeth Warren and lagging in fundraising.

Ezekiel: It is unusual for Biden, but I think he probably has the right strategy in trying to just let Congress handle it. The other school of thought would be that Trump attacking him is good because it sucks up oxygen from other candidates and forces other Democrats to publicly defend him. But I think they’re het up about it as it is.

Ed: Yeah, Cory Booker leaped to his defense today.

Ben: Is het up a phrase I don’t know?

Ezekiel: Yeah, it means “agitated.” Ezekiel’s Word of the Day.

Ed: Where I’m from, we say “got all riled up.”

Ben: That one I’m familiar with.

Ezekiel: I believe het is derived from a colloquial past tense of heat. This is the chat now.

Ben: Ha, back to politics. Obviously, the situations are different, but watching Biden over the past few days, I have flashbacks to John Kerry in 2004 (swift boats) or Hillary Clinton in 2016 (emails). There’s this notion that a candidate can simply ignore a made-up scandal and it will go away. But Trump is a master of repetition, and I think Biden risks letting him get away with quite a lot here.

Ezekiel: It would be different in an environment where impeachment weren’t a near certainty.

Ed: I have to say, Biden’s ability to get out of jams remains amazing. Speaking of three-fers, the day after the June debate, I observed that Biden’s performance had hurt him in three ways: showed his age, showed his complacency, and exposed his potential weakness among African-Americans. It was so striking I got quoted on Meet the Press. Three weeks later, Biden was exactly where he was before in the polls. So I’m not rushing into any claims that he’s on the ropes. Yeah, his third-quarter fundraising was, as I wrote, “meh,” but it’s not like he won’t meet payroll.

Ben: Yes, it’s been something of a pastime here to count him out preemptively. But it’s also true that he has trailed Warren in several recent polls — national and Iowa/New Hampshire — which wasn’t the case before.

Ed: Well, this is precisely why Team Biden has shifted its spin into projecting a two-way race in which early Warren wins just qualify her for the Big Fight with Biden — instead of croaking him and everyone else.

Ezekiel: Obviously, so much of his appeal to Democrats is tied up in his appeal in the general election, and his pitch is on a return to normalcy so this stuff could hypothetically be damaging to his chances in the primaries even if Democrats don’t buy it. But I don’t know whether we know yet whether it actually is.

It’s unclear to me whether that has anything to do with the allegations about his son. Has there been any polling from Democrats about that?

Ed: Don’t know of any polling, Ezekiel. There’s been some piling-on by lefty voices arguing that Hunter Biden is very relevant to the Democratic contest. Nothing by candidates. But it is worth asking if your average Democratic voter will hear all this and empathize with Biden as the father who has lost two children prematurely and can’t really control his wayward son. Or if said voter will look at Hunter and see the very kind of person Warren and Sanders keep warning us about.

Ezekiel: I can very much imagine them empathizing with him and also voting against him.

Ben: On that topic, the allegation put forward by Trump is bogus, but Hunter’s lucrative involvement with a Ukrainian gas company may not be something Biden wants to talk about. To what extent are Biden’s hands tied here if he did choose to mount a more frontal assault on the president’s claims?

Ezekiel: His hands aren’t tied — the only option not available to him here is throwing his son under the bus.

Ed: He could in theory come right back and say, “Let’s talk about kids profiting from their father’s power,” and get people fired up about the Trump clan.

Ezekiel: But I think under the current situation, “Biden Hits Back” headlines are not really what he wants.

Ben: What does he want?

Ezekiel: “Democrats Proceed Toward Impeachment Hearings.”

Ben: It’s not like that’s going to stop this talking point.

Ezekiel: Is hitting back going to stop the talking point? He doesn’t want a back-and-forth over Hunter’s behavior; he wants a back-and-forth over Trump’s behavior.

Ed: Part of me thinks that, like everything else problematic about Biden, the contrast with Trump makes him and his restorationist message look better, even nostalgically good. But Ezekiel is right; he needs the spotlight to be elsewhere right now.

Ben: I think hitting back may neutralize the talking point more effectively than doing nothing. Hanging back risks Trump’s owning the subject completely (yes, even during impeachment proceedings). But it also signals that Biden isn’t quite ready to deal with all the other crap Trump will throw at him should he be the nominee.

Ezekiel: I don’t agree. I think the situation would be different if he were actually the nominee, but in the primaries, I don’t think it gets him anything.

Ed: I’ve never thought Biden’s electability advantage is attributable to the belief that he’s a “fighter.” It’s mostly the relatable Uncle Joe who has reasonable ambitions and doesn’t frighten swing voters.

Ben: I agree, but you need to be a bit of a fighter against this opponent.

Ed: He’s not exactly sitting in a corner whimpering. I think he and his people are weighing their options and doing hundreds of focus groups. Part of today’s angst is from an article full of blind quotes from donors who are bitching about their investment. It’s sort of what they do.

Ezekiel: I think this may or may not hurt Biden and he may or may not win the nomination, but I’m not convinced that “hitting back” would accomplish anything. In fact, if he did, I’d start wondering if he were desperate.

Ed: I agree, and I think it’s a natural time for him to sit back and see how the story rolls out. Strategically, Bernie’s health problems and the failure of any other candidate to make a move means he really can take his time in the nomination race and try to position himself as the beneficiary of the inevitable jitters about Warren. And maybe not say anything weird at next week’s debate!

Ben: I’m not advocating that he focus on this all the time, but I think his response so far could have been a lot stronger and at no damage to his credibility or standing.

Ed: Speaking of the debate, I’m sure he’ll be asked about it, and the other candidates will probably feel called upon to defend him and attack Trump over it all. Again, he’ll have his chances. And for all I know that’s what he’s waiting on, to Ben’s great frustration.

Ben: “Now look, this whole thing is a bunch of malarkey.”

Ezekiel: Lol.

Ed: “I was discussing this with Barack, and I said, ‘Barack, this whole thing is a bunch of malarkey. Right, Barack?’”

Ben: Haha."

Most of the 12 debaters who will be on the stage in Ohio on Tuesday (a dozen, now that Tulsi Gabbard announced she will not go through with her threat to boycott the event as part of a DNC–media scheme to “rig” the nomination contest) are familiar figures to those who tune in regularly to these spectacles. Ten of them have been in all three previous debates, and Gabbard missed the September stage. But now, voters will see someone who might be a new face: Tom Steyer.

The billionaire activist will make his debut at the fourth debate, after his strategy of heavy spending in early states whose polls help candidates qualify for these events paid off. Steyer has rarely earned more than one percent in national polls of the 2020 field. But his polling average (according to RealClearPolitics) is at 2.3 percent in Iowa, 2 percent in New Hampshire, 3.5 percent in Nevada and 3 percent in South Carolina. (Interestingly enough, he barely registers support in his current home state of California, despite his conspicuous involvement, mostly as a big donor, in the progressive politics of the Golden State for years.) The debate is a great opportunity for him to expand his national profile after a late start, but how will he use that opportunity?

Presumably he will try to introduce himself to voters in places that haven’t seen his campaign ads or his earlier spots promoting impeachment of Trump long before that became a majority position among Democratic pols. He could tout his leadership on that issue, though it’s no longer controversial in his party (the entire presidential field has now endorsed impeachment proceedings). Or he could talk about his pre-impeachment focus on promoting climate-change activism (one observer called him “the green-minded answer to the conservative Koch brothers”) even though that might open him up to questions about the fossil-fuel investments made by the hedge-fund enterprise that earned him his fortune. But mostly you can expect him to exploit his position as one of the only two non-politicians on the stage (the other is Andrew Yang) to push his progressive version of Trump’s own populist-outsider-too-rich-to-be-bought message. The New York Times noted the central paradox of Steyer’s campaign in late August:

Running as something of a patrician populist, Mr. Steyer brushed aside the dissonance of someone with his résumé — Exeter, Yale, Stanford, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs — paying for ads that castigate the influence of “the powerful and well-connected.”

“I am the outsider in this race,” Mr. Steyer said in an interview. He described Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont as “part of the establishment” and asked whether the front-runner in the polls, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., really understood what this moment called for.

“The question really is for anybody running, including Vice President Biden, are you aware of how much has to change?” Mr. Steyer said, outlining a two-pronged agenda that would begin with rule changes to curb corporate power followed by significant action to address climate change.

This sort of talk might attract some fire from candidates like Warren and Sanders if they deign to pay much attention to Steyer during the debate. And rivals and moderators alike could bring up the common complaints that Steyer basically bought his spot on the stage with all that early-state spending, and that the $100 million he has pledged to pony up for his campaign would be better invested in down-ballot candidates or get-out-the-vote efforts.

It’s unclear what sort of personal impression Steyer will make with viewers. He is, after all, another older (62) straight white male who doesn’t have the sort of biography that lends itself to Democratic political audiences. He is religiously observant (an Episcopalian like Pete Buttigieg, the most conspicuous churchgoer in the field), and doesn’t seem to have typical rich-guy vices or outlandish tastes. CalMatters summed up his personal style succinctly:

Steyer is a bit of a contradiction himself. In the mold of Warren Buffet, he is famously restrained in his spending habits (to a point). His sartorial style could be described as “Boomer dad”: He regularly wears the same tartan tie and a colorful beaded belt he bought on a trip to Kenya. He flies commercial, for environmental reasons. Speaking to CalMatters over the phone from Iowa, he recalls meeting a “slick-as-could-be” energy lobbyist a few years back who was wearing a “$5,000 suit.” As if Steyer couldn’t drop ten times that on a new outfit every morning for the rest of his life.

Like Buffett, Steyer also has pledged to give away at least half of his wealth before he dies.

So Steyer is a paradoxical man running on a paradoxical platform. No matter how he does in his first debate, he probably isn’t going anywhere soon. He’s already qualified for the next debate in November. He obviously doesn’t need to worry about running out of money (he managed to raise $2 million from other people in the third quarter of this year). And as a hypersuccessful investment manager, he probably won’t be willing to write off the dough he’s already dropped in the early states until voters vote.

Get used to seeing him and hearing this self-styled billionaire scourge of the billionaires."

Mayor Pete Buttigieg debuted a new look at Tuesday’s primary debate: that of a moderate pugilist, a combative scold whose engagement with his opponents’ ideas ranged from derisive to dismissive. Adopting a tone that verged on snide, he assailed several of the more left-leaning candidates onstage. Beto O’Rourke’s mandatory assault-rifle buybacks proposal became a “shiny object” from a man Buttigieg “[didn’t] need lessons from … on courage, political or otherwise”; the details of Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All plan, marked by her insistence on discussing its funding in terms of costs rather than taxes, were obscured by her evasive responses to “a yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer” — behavior, the mayor said, that encapsulates “why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.”

As my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti wrote, it’s all part of a strategy to position Buttigieg to benefit if Joe Biden falters. With Warren and Bernie Sanders staking out the primary’s leftward flank, the mayor sees his best hope for securing the nomination — or at least catapulting himself into a higher polling tier — in drawing contrasts with them and projecting himself as a younger, more lucid, and less baggage-laden competitor for supporters of the former vice-president: liberal centrists and older black voters. It’s a risky gambit for two reasons. First, Buttigieg’s appeal derives largely from his mild-mannered charm and self-branding as an above-the-fray consensus-builder — both of which were undermined by his antagonistic behavior on Tuesday. But more crucially, it’s imperiled by his knack for thwarting his own efforts to build relationships with black voters, whose support he’ll need if he’s to seriously challenge Biden, Warren, Sanders, or even Kamala Harris.

The latest example occurred on Friday, when the Associated Press reported that the mayor was scheduled to attend a fundraiser co-hosted by Steve Patton. As head of Chicago’s law department under former mayor Rahm Emanuel, Patton was a key figure in the administration’s efforts to hide dashcam footage of Laquan McDonald’s killing from the public. The black 17-year-old was shot 16 times in 2014 by then–police officer Jason Van Dyke, who was later convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison. Officers at the scene initially lied, saying that McDonald had lunged toward them with a knife. The Emanuel administration pushed to hide video that disputed their account until after the mayor won reelection — a decision made under Patton’s advisement. When reporters this week drew attention to Patton’s role in the cover-up, and that he’d made a max donation of $5,600 to Buttigieg’s campaign, Buttigieg and his staffers declined to comment, according to the AP. But as public pressure mounted on Friday morning, they abruptly removed Patton as a co-host and refunded his money. “Transparency and justice for Laquan McDonald is more important than a campaign contribution,” Chris Meagher, the Buttigieg campaign’s communications director, told Axios. “We are returning the money he contributed to the campaign and the money he has collected. He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending.”

Buttigieg has criticized promises made by the Warren and Sanders campaigns to refuse high-dollar donations from corporate PACs and lobbyists. “My competitors can go with whatever strategy they like … we’re not going to beat [Trump] with pocket change,” he said earlier this week. But ongoing developments showcase the irony of this stance: Buttigieg has attracted less money in donations than either of them, and, until public pressure forced his hand, one of his donors was a central figure in a police shooting cover-up. All of which complicates a campaign that’s already weathered its share of racial controversy, particularly the questions surrounding Buttigieg’s firing of South Bend’s black police chief and the police shooting death of Eric Logan over the summer — both of which have drawn fiery criticism from black locals. The mayor’s efforts to make nice have come off, to some of them, as superficial and unconvincing. “You running for president and you expect black people to vote for you?” one woman asked as he addressed a march protesting Logan’s death in June. “I’m not asking for your vote,” Buttigieg replied. “You ain’t gonna get it either,” the woman said.

By several accounts, Buttigieg’s once-dismal support numbers among black voters in key primary states, most notably South Carolina, are trending upward, and his black outreach team insists that name recognition is his main barrier to improving them exponentially. But the abrupt tonal shifts displayed during Tuesday’s debate and his ill-advised association with Steve Patton — paired with his initial decision not to comment when Patton’s role in the Laquan McDonald case was brought to his attention, and only parting ways with him once public pressure made their relationship untenable — risk creating even more barriers to his efforts to amass black support than his troubles in South Bend had already created. Perhaps more troubling, his newly combative attitude and derision toward progressive positions for which he once professed unequivocal support suggest the kind of boring careerism that fuels the very problems on Capitol Hill that he claims to want to solve. Last-minute efforts to mend the rifts he’s caused with black voters are unlikely to save his campaign. But they do illustrate why his path into Biden supporters’ hearts is rockier than he might have estimated."

Maybe we’re being haunted for our sins. The 2016 Democratic primary ought to be over, but it looks alive, or at least undead. Occasionally it moans: Medicare for All just isn’t reasonable and heartland voters love Aetna as they would a god. It usually shows up on Twitter, where all cursed thoughts go to holler. There, it recently sensed bait. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and (probably) Rashida Tlaib have endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, and behold:

Eisner, who is the academic director of the Columbia Journalism School, appears to have deleted her tweet. But her comment still breathed new life into a familiar old phantom. In the most literal sense, Bernie Sanders is not running against Hillary Clinton this year. But the acrimony generated by their contest lingers. It is palpable in Eisner’s failure to understand why Ocasio-Cortez and Omar would endorse Sanders, a man who, since he is also old and white, superficially has little in common with them. In Eisner’s reckoning, it’s as if identity operates on a points-based system, and whoever had the most points automatically wins voters who look most like them — policies be damned.

But policy matters. It mattered in 2016, too, despite a common pretense to the contrary. There was generally a push from the Clinton camp to present their candidate as the sensible but progressive alternative to Sanders. At their most dogmatic, Clinton surrogates spoke of Sanders as if he were the antithesis to identity politics and as if support for him betrayed feminism itself. “We can tell our story of how we climbed the ladder, and a lot of you younger women think it’s done. It’s not done. There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other!” Madeleine Albright said of female Sanders supporters in 2016. Stupid, but still preferable to Gloria Steinem’s apparent belief that young women picked candidates based on who they wanted to bone. “When you’re young, you’re thinking: ‘Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie,’” she mused.

But the girls weren’t traitors, and they didn’t just want to get laid. They wanted Medicare for All. It was never that complicated. Anyone who picks their allegiances based on their community’s interests displays a form of identity politics. But on its own, the simple fact of shared identity does not an ally make. There is a vast gulf, politically, between Sarah Palin and Senator Elizabeth Warren. The gulf between the progressive Warren and a centrist like Amy Klobuchar is smaller, but real. Authentically practiced, identity politics do not mean that a person will rally around a member of their group. In 2016, many women believed their specific interests would be better served by a different theory of change. They had no time to wait on Clinton’s incrementalism, and no reason to trust her to take them where they needed to go. That’s still true now. Clinton’s centrism outlasted her political career: Its new avatars are Klobuchar and Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg.

The perspective Eisner aired had already shown signs of unholy new life. “I actually overheard someone saying, that I thought was an interesting point, that basically at this point if you are still supporting Sanders as opposed to Warren, it’s kind of showing your sexism,” Democratic strategist Emily Tisch Sussman recently said on MSNBC. It’s not. Even if Warren is far closer to Sanders than she is to Clinton, Sanders’s supporters have substantive reasons to prefer the senator from Vermont over his friend from Massachusetts.

Applied to the congresswomen in particular, this apolitical grasp of identity is uniquely inadequate. On the stump and in comments to reporters, the two refer often to their backgrounds — to their gender, their ethnicities, their experiences with economic precariousness and, in Omar’s case, with war. Even if they wanted to forget who they are, Donald Trump wouldn’t let them. His attacks on the two congresswomen, and on their frequent allies Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, reveal his specific antipathy for immigrants and Muslims and women. Trump doesn’t just want them to shut up, he wants them to “go back” to “the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” When Trump went to Minnesota for a recent rally, he didn’t just attack Omar and her politics. He attacked the state’s Somali community, to which Omar belongs, by name.

It’s a strange notion, the idea that ideology and identity sit in separate boxes to be picked up or set down as someone sees fit. But they aren’t separate, which means they aren’t opposing forces, and one is never subservient to the other. Ideology and identity are wrapped up in each other, they shape each other, and this is as true for right-wing men as it is for left-wing women.

The congresswomen have explained this in their own words, over and over and over again. In the aggregate, they have probably explained their views more often than most politicians; that is the price of being an insurgent. Americans are so unused to leftists in office that the political philosophies of both women remained topics of national debate long after they’d finished their campaigns. Anyone curious about their presidential endorsement could at least defer to their own words and deeds. Ocasio-Cortez volunteered for the Sanders campaign and describes herself as a democratic socialist, like the senator. She’s ably explained her ideology on multiple occasions. “I’m an educator, I’m an organizer, and I believe that what we’re really seeing is just a move for health care, housing, and education in the United States,” she told NBC’s Chuck Todd in a key 2018 interview. “An important part of my strategy in winning was building a broad-based coalition of people. So while there’s a focus on this one aspect of the coalition. The definition of democratic socialism to me again is the fact that in a modern, moral, and wealthy society, no American should be too poor to live.”

Omar isn’t a member of DSA, even if Trump did just call her an “America-hating socialist.” But politically she aligns herself closely with Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, with whom she recently introduced a sweeping bill to cancel student-loan debt. She stated her rationale quite clearly on Tuesday, when she announced her endorsement. In a video released by the Sanders campaign, Omar describes the senator as “the only candidate that has built a movement and continues to build a movement that transcends gender, ethnicity, religion.”

“There was an America that I dreamed about,” she added. “There is an America that most people believe in. It is an ideal. It’s not a reality yet.” The dream is everything. That’s why she and Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders. The goal isn’t a world where identity no longer matters, but one where it doesn’t hold anyone back."

Democrats have taken particular issue with Facebook’s decision to allow an ad from President Trump’s 2020 campaign that included falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) responded to Facebook’s decision by running her own campaign ad, satirically stating that Zuckerberg supports Trump for reelection.

Zuckerberg framed the issue as part of a broader debate over free expression, warning about the dangers of social networks, including Facebook, “potentially cracking down too much.” He called on the United States to set an example for tailored regulation in contrast with other countries, including China, that censor political speech online. And Zuckerberg stressed Facebook must stand strong against governments that seek to “pull back” on free speech in the face of heightened social and political tensions.

Zuckerberg’s appearance in Washington marks his most forceful attempt to articulate his vision for how governments and tech giants should approach the Web’s most intractable problems. The scale of Facebook and its affiliated apps, Instagram and WhatsApp, which make up a virtual community of billions of users, poses challenges for Zuckerberg and regulators around the world as they struggle to contain hate speech, falsehoods, violent imagery and terrorist propaganda on social media.

Next week, Zuckerberg is set to testify at a congressional hearing that will probably serve as a wide-ranging review of the company’s business practices. Facebook’s size, meanwhile, has become a primary object of derision from some Democrats seeking the White House in 2020, who contend that Facebook is too big, powerful and problematic and should be regulated or broken apart.

The election lends new urgency to Facebook’s issues. The social network became a major platform for disinformation during the 2016 race, and experts say the forms of manipulation and deception have evolved since then, including the arrival of deepfakes, or videos that convincingly distort what a subject is doing or saying using artificial intelligence. A fake clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), doctored to make her appear drunk, that went viral on Facebook in May drew attention to the problem.

Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook has work to do to combat such digital ills. He revealed that Facebook has been “working through what our policy should be” on deepfake videos. “I think we’re getting pretty close to at least rolling out the first version of it,” Zuckerberg said. He declined to provide additional details.

The tech giant declined to take down the video, though it did later append a notation that it was false, drawing sharp criticism from the House speaker and others that the company had failed to address a blatant lie.

Asked if the Pelosi incident illustrated a serious gap at Facebook, Zuckerberg agreed. “If anything becomes a big issue, and we haven’t already prepared for it, then that means we were too slow in preparing for it,” he said. “And I think figuring out which types of deepfakes are actually a threat today, versus are a theoretical future threat once the technology advances, is one of the things that we need to make sure we get right.”

But Zuckerberg stood behind the way Facebook, which has long eschewed fact-checking political ads, handles political ads. “I think we’re in the right place on this,” he said. “In general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.""

The Trump campaign ad about the Bidens made claims about their connections to Ukraine, a critical element in the congressional impeachment inquiry. Biden’s campaign asked Facebook to remove the ad, describing it as false, but the social network declined, pointing to a policy against fact-checking such political speech. The company’s response drew widespread rebukes from Biden and other 2020 Democratic candidates, including Warren, many of whom have charged that Facebook essentially is profiting from misinformation.

Speaking at Georgetown later Thursday, Zuckerberg acknowledged the company once considered prohibiting political ads but decided against it, believing it “favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.”

But a spokesman for Biden’s campaign, Bill Russo, later assailed Zuckerberg for an unconvincing rationale. “Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company’s bottom line,” Russo said, “and his choice to cloak Facebook’s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.”

Facebook has faced a barrage of criticism from both sides of the aisle about what content it censors. Republicans, for example, have contended that the company censors conservative users and news websites, a charge the company has long denied.

“Often, the people who call the most for us to remove content are often the first to complain when it’s their content that falls on the wrong side of a policy,” Zuckerberg said. “These are very complex issues, and in general, unless it is absolutely clear what to do, I think you want to err on the side of greater expression.”

For many Democrats, however, Trump’s ads expose vast vulnerabilities at Facebook that malicious actors could exploit to spread misinformation targeting the 2020 presidential election, just as Russian agents used Facebook and other social media sites to spread falsehoods, sow social and political unrest, and undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Zuckerberg stressed that he believes Facebook is in a “much better place now” to stop such disinformation campaigns, citing the company’s investments in staff and artificial intelligence. But he also cautioned that misinformation is a threat that one “could never say that it’s going to go away, because they’re going to keep on pushing.” In recent months, Facebook has reported disinformation campaigns from countries including Iran and China.

AD

AD

He blamed the U.S. government’s lack of initial response as part of the reason the problem has worsened since the last presidential election. “Unfortunately, the U.S. did not have a particularly strong response to Russia after 2016,” he continued, “so it sent the signal to other countries that they could get in on this, too.""

Zuckerberg’s speech comes seven months after he issued his initial call for governments to adopt “rules for the Internet,” and tech giants, including Facebook, to set up systems so that no one executive or company determines what is or isn’t appropriate online. Facebook is actively setting up a “supreme court” of sorts so that users can appeal the company’s decisions about the content it leaves up or takes down.

On Thursday, though, Zuckerberg's message served more as a warning that overreaction could stifle the very sort of speech that many regulators seek to protect.

He said a common perception these days is that “more people having a voice is leading to division, and not bringing people together,” he said. “In times of social tension we pull back on expression, and we always end up believing that it was the wrong thing to do.”

Politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. And so it makes sense that in the course of a Democratic presidential nominating contest in which a vast army of observers wait with bated breath for the long-delayed but perhaps inevitable collapse of support for Joe Biden, at least one of his lower-tier rivals is auditioning to become his successor in the affections of self-consciously “moderate” voters.

Sahil Kapur has noticed Pete Buttigieg’s look-me-over pitch to this large element of the Democratic electorate in Iowa:

Pete Buttigieg is pitching himself as an alternative to moderate Democrats who might not be sold on Joe Biden.

On a recent bus tour of Iowa, Buttigieg framed his argument, emphasizing the need to “re-center our politics” and recapture the notion of freedom and faith from conservatives who he says use those terms to “club people over the head.”

Mayor Pete is not, to be clear, a member of some formal ideological faction of the Democratic Party, like Bill Clinton was a member of the aggressively centrist Democratic Leadership Council. He’s more like Barack Obama, who eschewed ideological labels but deployed messaging (and, as president, policies) that appealed to voters and opinion leaders wary of the kind of anti-corporate “populism” that has consistently animated the labor-left elements of the party. Buttigieg’s status as the first viable openly gay (and married) presidential candidate serves to broaden his appeal in nonideological ways, just like Obama’s African-American identity. But Kapur offers examples of the South Bend mayor’s centrist messaging:

His “re-centering” message is designed to counter Republican caricatures of Democrats — he told Iowans that “freedom” isn’t just about businesses having fewer regulations, it’s about being free of crippling health care costs; and he says big government should get out of the way of women making reproductive choices.

More conspicuously, Mayor Pete touts his record as a military veteran with service in Afghanistan (an increasingly rare credential for politicians of either party), and he is both religiously observant and more than willing to blast the Christian right for its arrogant claims to speak for the Almighty while peddling its entirely secular conservative agenda. These are thematics that voters don’t hear from the economics-focused Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And while Buttigieg tries to be a bit subtle about it, the 37-year-old candidate emulates the Bill Clinton of 1992 by offering a generational critique of older pols as caught up in ancient ideological conflicts that don’t lead to solutions. This shot at Elizabeth Warren is characteristic:

“She and I are after the same goals,” he said of Warren. “But her pitch has a lot more to do with fighting — she’s more interested in the fighting part of it. I’m more interested in outcomes.”

Buttigieg’s policy stances also echo past centrist preoccupations, including a Clintonesque push for national service and, more famously, a “Medicare If You Want It” health-care proposal that is a lot like the original Obamacare plan in offering a choice between public and private insurance. His national-security agenda is more conventionally liberal-internationalist than that of most of his rivals, and his team of national-security advisers is led by Doug Wilson, an Obama Pentagon official and a former political director at the DLC (where I was one of his colleagues, for the record). When Buttigieg criticized Biden for representing a failed ideology of neoliberalism, lefty critics hooted derisively, calling Buttigieg the authentic neoliberal candidate. He hasn’t really triangulated against this sort of criticism from Team Democratic Socialist, but he might in the near future.

Obviously enough, this turn-to-the-center gambit by Buttigieg won’t work unless Biden finally begins to fade. And he has another problem, too: Democratic moderates have dominated the party in the past via a strong African-American voting base. That was true of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Al Gore (in his less progressive phase), Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. It was even true to some extent of John Kerry in 2004, who did surprisingly well among black primary voters while appealing to electability-focused voters worried about Howard Dean’s alleged radicalism.

The black-moderate alliance is fundamental to Biden’s continuing strength, of course. And unfortunately for Mayor Pete, and despite stout efforts (e.g., his Douglass Plan for racial justice), you could currently fit his black support base comfortably within one of those Iowa diners he has visited recently.

There are various explanations for Buttigieg’s exceptionally honkified following: his cerebral, multilingual “wine track” rhetoric, which tends to appeal to more affluent and college-educated white voters; his sexual orientation, with which we are told many African-Americans (particularly those who belong to Evangelical churches) are still uncomfortable; and above all, his history of conflict with black activists in South Bend unhappy with how he has handled police-brutality complaints — most recently after a fatal police shooting of an apparently innocent black man in June. Indeed, this may be the only aspect of his mayoral tenure in South Bend that has gained widespread national attention.

Mayor Pete’s problems with black voters aren’t particularly important to the categorical imperative he shares with others candidates to make a very good showing in lily-white Iowa. He is pouring his considerable resources (his second- and third-quarter fundraising hauls have been extremely impressive; his total contributions are at $51 million for the year) into the first-in-the-nation caucus state, where the RealClearPolitics polling average has him virtually tied with Bernie Sanders for third place. Aside from positioning him to exploit any Biden weakness (which the impeachment drive’s focus on a Ukraine scandal in which Uncle Joe’s last name is going to be mentioned a lot may exacerbate) — and Biden’s already struggling in Iowa — a strong Iowa showing could fatally undermine the viability of other possible pretenders to the mantle of Biden Alternative for Moderates, such as Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker. In the recent gold-standard Selzer Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, Buttigieg held 9 percent as compared to Harris’s 6 percent and Klobuchar’s and Booker’s 3 percent.

If Buttigieg does have something of an Iowa breakthrough — and particularly if the two major African-American candidates immediately fade — then he can hope minority voters give him a second look. It wouldn’t hurt his midwestern white-working-class appeal to get off the “wine track,” either. But understandably, he’s putting first things first, and surviving Iowa is job one."

Even as contestants prepare for next week’s 12-candidate Democratic debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, the November event is beginning to come together as well, NBC News reports:

MSNBC and The Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia next month, MSNBC announced Tuesday.

The debate will take place in prime time on Nov. 20, and will air live on MSNBC and Radio One. It will also stream on MSNBC.com and the Post’s website, as well as across mobile devices via NBC News and the Post’s mobile apps and Urban One’s digital platforms.

The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.

The Democratic National Committee toughened the polling and fundraising thresholds for this fifth debate, as I noted last month:

The thresholds for “grassroots fundraising” didn’t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states …

Nor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems.

At this point, eight candidates have qualified for the November stage: the aforementioned five polling champs, plus Cory Booker, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang (who got his fourth qualifying poll just today). Others have until November 13 to make the cut. As Politico reports, it’s looking a bit dicey for some, including four who will be on the stage in Ohio next week:

Currently, more than a dozen candidates are still short of the qualification thresholds, including four who will be on stage next week in Ohio: Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke. Those four have all said they’ve cleared the 165,000 donor threshold required for the debate, but each needs at least three more 3-percent polls to qualify.

It would be a good time for the October debaters who are November non-qualifiers to make a splash."

Earlier this year, Elizabeth Warren pandered to Republican voters by calling for the expropriation of the one percent’s wealth.

The senator’s proposed tax on the capital of America’s plutocrats alienated the median stockbroker. It also revealed that the former Harvard professor was badly out of touch with the hardworking, salt-of-the-earth, center-right pundits and economists who built this country. And their antipathy wasn’t hard to understand. Taxing wealth is an even greater affront to property rights and neoliberal orthodoxy than hiking top marginal rates. Plotted on a left-to-right ideological spectrum, Warren’s plan would be far off-center.

But it did play well with the liberal elites who apparently make up the GOP base: When Morning Consult ran Warren’s scheme by Republican voters, they supported it by 50 to 30 percent margin.

This finding reflected a simple fact that mainstream political coverage habitually elides: There is no tight correlation between a policy’s ideological extremity — as judged by its distance from status quo policy or the dictates of political theory — and its electoral viability. Many “far left” ideas are broadly popular (e.g., installing workers’ representatives on corporate boards, soaking the rich, giving federal jobs to all the unemployed), while some “centrist” ones are politically toxic (“entitlement reform,” the individual mandate for health insurance).

Nevertheless, much of the press persists in using “left wing” as an antonym for political pragmatism. Which is unfortunate, since it muddles a necessary debate about the genuine electoral trade-offs that Democrats face.

A recent New York Times column titled “What Democrats Could Lose With Their Left Turn” is illustrative of the problem. The piece’s author, Alexander Agadjanian of MIT’s Election Lab, aims to assess whether the left-wing bent of the Democrats’ 2020 debate is undermining the party’s prospects of beating Trump. To that end, he conducted the following survey experiment:

A random half of participants read a news snippet illustrating the leftward shift, while the other half read about unrelated topics, such as the schedule of election dates. The news item was a few sentences that included policies discussed by the candidates: decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings; expanding undocumented immigrants’ access to government services; replacing private health insurance with a government-run system; and establishing free public college for all children from working-class families. The content was drawn directly from real news coverage.

Both sets of respondents then indicated how they planned to vote in 2020 (whether for President Trump or the eventual Democratic nominee), how strongly they were considering voting Democratic, and how motivated they felt to turn out and vote for or against the Democratic nominee.

Agadjanian found that independent voters exposed to the Democrats’ “leftward shift” were six points less likely to support the party in 2020 than those who read about unrelated topics. Meanwhile, Democratic voters who read about their party’s left-wing policies were mildly more emphatic in their support of their party’s nominee. Taken together, the survey’s results suggest the left-wing policies Agadjanian polled are a significant net negative for Democrats — one conceivably large enough to cost them the election.

Agadjanian is admirably careful in contextualizing his findings. He notes that some progressive policies are popular, and that it is unclear which left-wing policies the Democratic nominee will choose to emphasize next year. Still, the framing of both his column and survey are misleading. The question he has examined is not “Do Democrats risk losing independents by moving left?” but rather, “If three of the Democratic Party’s least popular left-wing ideas are at the front of independent voters’ minds when they enter the ballot booth next year, will that be bad for the Democratic Party?”

The second question is more worthwhile than it may sound. Previous polling has established that decriminalizing border crossing, extending health-care benefits to undocumented immigrants, and abolishing private insurance are not majoritarian propositions (although, the last one tends to have broader support when contextualized in specific ways). But policies can be unpopular without being salient. So there is some value in knowing that these stances could ostensibly inform the voting preferences of swing constituencies.

There is no value, however, in casting these three policies as definitive of the Democratic Party’s ideological shift. A survey that had independent voters read about the Democratic field’s embrace of wealth taxes, worker codetermination, marijuana legalization, and a $15 minimum wage might very well yield the opposite conclusion about the electoral implications of the Democrats’ “left turn,” given the broad popularity of those ideas. By equating the political viability of an arbitrary (and unusually unpopular) batch of left-wing policies with that of Democrats “moving left” in general, the Times column provided progressives readers with an easy means of dismissing its findings outright.

And that’s regrettable, since Agadjanian’s findings are worthy of consideration when properly contextualized. There are some genuine tensions between ideological progressivism and political pragmatism. Majoritarian opinion is not ideologically consistent. Voters lean left on some issues, and right on others. All else being equal, a politician whose issue positions are determined by ideological conviction — whether progressive, conservative, or centrist — will be more vulnerable to opposition attacks than one who outsources her agenda to (competent) pollsters and consultants.

Meanwhile, some aspects of progressive ideology put the left in perpetual tension with majoritarian intuitions. The left exists to oppose arbitrary hierarchy and champion those who are oppressed and exploited by the status quo social order. In a context of extreme economic inequality, this commitment aligns progressives with the vast majority (if not quite 99 percent) of Americans in their capacity as workers. Thus, it isn’t too surprising that the left often boasts majoritarian positions on questions that concern the balance of power between economic classes. And yet, progressives’ commitment to representing the downtrodden also compels them to oppose unjust hierarchies that serve the (unenlightened) interest of most Americans. In a debate between capital and labor, standing with the people who work for a living tends to be an electorally expedient proposition. In a debate that (ostensibly) pits the interests of U.S. citizens against those of undocumented immigrants, standing up for the side that lacks voting rights tends to be electorally disadvantageous. And the same is true of policy disputes that put the immediate interests of America’s white majority and its black minority at cross-purposes.

This does not mean that the left should cease fighting to secure social protection for the undocumented or reparations for African-Americans. But it does suggest that the left can’t presume its moral truths are self-evident to the 99 percent it claims to champion, or the 50-plus percent of voters whose support it aims to win. If progressives wish to maximize their near-term power, then their electoral strategy must account for majoritarian sentiment. Which is to say, it must be formulated around unsentimental answers to questions like: Where are voters with us, and where are they against us? What is the probability of changing the public’s mind on [unpopular policy x] within the duration of a single election cycle (i.e., how widespread and consistent over time is the public’s opposition to our stance)? How salient is [unpopular policy x] with swing constituencies? Is there a way to mitigate the electoral detriment of [unpopular policy x] without abandoning our commitment to advancing that goal?

Agadjanian’s experiment doesn’t tell us that a Democratic nominee who endorses the decriminalization of border crossing will inevitably lose significant support for doing so. Among other things, his survey design is a poor approximation of a general-election messaging environment; presumably, the typical independent voter will be exposed to information about some of the GOP’s less popular positions next fall. And yet Agadjanian’s respondents were presented exclusively with unpopular Democratic stances. For this reason, it’s not at all clear that independent voters’ antipathy for left-wing immigration policy or anxiety about nationalizing the health-insurance industry would overwhelm their opposition to tax cuts for the rich, or Republican attacks on Medicaid.

What the survey experiment does establish, however, is that the Democratic nominee will have an interest in minimizing the salience of her party’s most unpopular stances (which are not necessarily its most “left wing” ones). The incentives of the Democratic primary, unfortunately, have led many candidates to do the opposite: In order to distinguish themselves in a crowded field, lesser-known contenders have loudly embraced positions that their rivals deemed too politically dicey, while Sanders supporters have emphasized the most unpopular aspects of Medicare for All in order to separate the policy’s true believers from its fake friends.

In a better world, progressive interest groups would be able to operate like GOP-aligned corporate lobbies. Payday lenders don’t demand Republican presidential candidates campaign on a pro-usury message. And Big Coal raised no complaint when Donald Trump insisted that his administration would make clean air and water a top priority. These interest groups understood that their demands were electorally dicey. And they knew that a Trump administration could be trusted to advance their aims, regardless of what the candidate said on the campaign trail. For good reason, advocates for the undocumented and uninsured lack such confidence in the Democratic Party. And that raises difficult questions about how the benefits of pressuring candidates into publicly championing the progressive position on any given wedge issue stack up against the potential electoral risks of such advocacy.

There are real tensions between the goals of maximizing the progressivity of the Democratic agenda, and minimizing the near-term power of the Republican Party. And such tensions merit examination and debate. But punditry that ignores the electorally expedient aspects of the progressive agenda, and tacitly equates centrism with pragmatism, does little to promote such nuanced discussions and may even preempt them. The available evidence suggests that the Democratic Party can simultaneously move left and into power — it just needs to take care when mapping out its route."

Last week she was mentioned 327 times on Fox, almost twice as often as on MSNBC and three times as much as on CNN.

An increase in attention might not be too surprising given that she is building support and in some polls is now leading the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But it’s the focus on her from Fox that stands out. It’s an indication that the conservative media are about to initiate a protocol they’ve had great success with before.

Just to be clear, conservatives, including those in the media, have every right to explore Warren’s history and record to explain to their audiences why she’s the most villainous person to walk the Earth in millennia and, if she became president, would leave America nothing but a rancid heap of burned-out rubble and rotting flesh. But there’s a particular pattern that repeats itself in election after election. At first, someone like Warren is paid only marginal attention — criticized, to be sure, perhaps even mocked, but not with the volume and intensity to come. Then at some point, when it looks like that person at least might be the Democratic nominee, those outlets — Fox, radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh, conservative newspapers, magazines and websites — pull the switch on a project to focus their audience’s attention on the threat the candidate represents. While some of the energy goes into genuine investigations — if they can discover some dirt on the candidate, they’re only too happy — for the most part it’s about shaping the emotional responses of their audiences, which also happen to overlap almost completely with Trump’s base.

The goal is to produce not just opposition but venomous hatred through stoking fear and anger. If Warren continues on her current trajectory, conservative audiences will be told day after day that her prospective presidency will be a nightmare of suffering, a betrayal of what the country represents, an attack on them and everything they stand for.

To see how effective it can be, consider a fascinating poll result from a few months ago. Gallup asked respondents their opinions of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and found her image positive among Democrats by 56-15 percent but negative among Republicans by 73-5 percent. In other words, Republicans felt more strongly about her than Democrats, and more of them had opinions about her. Why? The best explanation is that for some time Ocasio-Cortez had been a constant topic of discussion on Fox and other conservative outlets, bordering on obsession.

One of the critical characteristics of this process of turning vague dislike among the Republican base into outright loathing is that the substance of the criticism is in some ways almost irrelevant. Three years ago, if you asked a Republican why they hated Hillary Clinton so much, it’s a good bet they would have cited her supposedly problematic use of email, as absurd as that was. That, of course, was just a vehicle for a whole complex of negative feelings that had been cultivated for years about her, many having to do with a backlash against the idea of women with power.

Near the center of their critique, conservatives will often put some lie or series of lies, like the idea that Barack Obama isn’t an American or that John F. Kerry faked his war record. They’ve already given it a shot with one bogus story about Warren, that she supposedly wasn’t telling the truth about losing her job as a teacher in 1971 because she got pregnant. It failed, but they’ll try again and again in an endless quest for something that will resonate.

For each Democratic presidential nominee, the raw materials are different, but the result is the same: taking the fear and anger that conservative media create year-round about Democrats in general and focusing it all on one person until the hatred of that person burns with the fire of a thousand suns.

Once that machine starts to crank up, a lot of Democrats are going to panic. Look at how vulnerable our nominee is, they’ll cry. They’re going to do to them just what they did to Clinton and Kerry and Gore! We’re doomed!

But the truth is that they’ll do it to any candidate with a real shot at becoming the Democratic nominee. If Warren is going to be that person, how she responds to the onslaught will tell us a lot about her resilience as a candidate. We’re going to get a taste of it now, but the real storm is yet to come.

The brouhaha over Bernie Sanders’s hospitalization for heart disease and his brief surgery to install two stents to deal with a blockage created a lot of confusion. And a lot of the talk was less about Sanders’s heart trouble than about his age, and how the incident might remind journalists and voters alike of the septuagenarians (Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren as well as Sanders) occupying the first, second, and third positions in all the national polls.

But for the record, it’s important to understand that this is hardly the first time someone on the path toward, or occupying, the White House has had a heart attack or some equally serious health condition. Two complicating factors are the evolving treatments that have made some once-feared diseases manageable, or at least non-life-threatening, and, just as important, how easy it used to be for candidates and presidents alike to hide health problems. John F. Kennedy, to cite one well-known example, was diagnosed with Addison’s Disease in 1947, an ailment that can cause acute pain and involve dangerous medications. That was five years before his first statewide campaign and 13 years before his presidential campaign. As the Los Angeles Times noted a few years ago, it was kept a secret at least until after he was inaugurated:

Hard though it is to believe these days – when a celebrity’s smallest sneeze is analyzed – Kennedy’s family and advisors were able to keep his medical history virtually secret. Kennedy, at 43 the youngest president ever elected, was portrayed as healthy and vibrant. In reality, he suffered various problems controlled by a daily regimen of steroids and other drugs.

Kennedy’s predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, had a lot of serious health issues, as Healthline explains:

Eisenhower instructed his press secretary to inform the public of his condition after his heart attack in 1955. Six months before the election of 1956, Eisenhower was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and underwent surgery, from which he recovered. One year later, the president had a mild stroke, which he was able to overcome.

And Lyndon Johnson had what was by all accounts a severe heart attack the same year as Ike’s, in 1955, when he was only 47. Despite his duties as Senate Majority Leader, Johnson was hospitalized for more than a month and didn’t return to Washington for several months after that. He had at least two more heart attacks, the last one fatal, after leaving the White House.

Dick Cheney, who never ran for president but was on the campaign trail twice as George W. Bush’s running mate and was, as the saying goes, a “heartbeat from the presidency” for eight years, had a history of heart disease even more extensive than Johnson’s, suffering his first heart attack at 37 in 1978, and three more before becoming vice-president. He subsequently had another heart attack shortly after leaving office, and then had a heart transplant in 2012.

Only one president died of heart disease while in office: Warren G. Harding.

But a number of presidents have had heart problems shortly after leaving office, including most recently Bill Clinton (quadruple-bypass surgery) and George W. Bush (a stent).

Other presidents have had other deadly ailments, ranging from the paralytic strokes that debilitated Woodrow Wilson during his second term to the prostate and skin cancers for which Ronald Reagan underwent operations during his second term. Unlike these, some medical conditions were well known at the time, most obviously the polio that confined Franklin D. Roosevelt to a wheelchair long before he ran for president.

As the FDR example illustrates, sometimes a successful battle against health conditions can become a symbol of courage and perseverance. Transparency about such conditions definitely helps: A previously hidden history of mental-health treatments suddenly destroyed the 1972 vice-presidential candidacy of Thomas Eagleton practically before it started. Indeed, that experience led to what has become an ever-more-elaborate vetting process for presidential and vice-presidential candidates in the ensuing years.

How voters might react to a serious health condition might also depend on the factors usually lumped under the term “lifestyle choices.” When LBJ had his first heart attack, he was a three-pack-a-day cigarette smoker. He quit coffin nails after nearly dying but never shed being a workaholic and fried-food addict. Given today’s diagnosis and treatment advances, a mild heart attack and a couple of stents should hardly be alarming, but the more a candidate can reassure voters he or she isn’t working or playing him- or herself into the grave, the better."

Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, what last night’s debate tells us about the Democratic field.

Last night was the first Democratic primary debate since Congress opened its official impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump. Did that change anything?

The opening question, a softball about impeachment, allowed every last one of the 12 candidates on the overcrowded stage to tell us what we already know: They are all for it! So the advent of the impeachment inquiry per se didn’t change anything. But once we moved beyond that dull panorama of like-mindedness, this turned out to be a clarifying debate. By that I don’t mean it was an exciting debate, or an inspiring debate, or a debate that would draw in those Americans (most of them) who don’t want to think about 2020 politics before we get to 2020. But the shape of the Democratic field now seems crystal clear. Tuesday night seemed like a death knell for seven of the dozen candidacies on stage, including Joe Biden’s. It’s time for the actual contenders to go at it on a less cluttered field.

Among the seven also-rans, the low-hanging losers are Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Steyer (we hardly knew ye), the billionaire vanity candidate whose main attribute is that at least he is not Howard Schultz. Their time to gain traction in this cycle has come and gone. Obviously O’Rourke and Castro are future prospects, though it may take a while for some Democrats to forgive O’Rourke for his vainglorious decision to run for president rather than to challenge the incumbent John Cornyn in next year’s Texas Senate race.

Cory Booker and Biden, two candidates who’ve always looked highly plausible in theory but repeatedly fail to deliver, are more complicated cases.

Booker is sunny and personable — as unobjectionable as an easy-listening radio host. His upbeat, why-can’t-we-all-get-along shtick is surely sincere, but it’s part of the reason why he’s never risen in the polls: It comes off as empty bombast — cheery bombast, to be sure, but no substitute for substance. In a dark time, voters are not looking for a “politics of joy,” to recall the thesis of Hubert Humphrey’s ill-fated campaign in 1968. And they aren’t looking for rage, a market that has been cornered by Trump in any event. What they are looking for is fight. Booker has yet to show that he has much of that, despite his periodic pumping up of his mellifluous voice to simulate fisticuffs.

In last night’s debate, he also revealed just how hard it is for him to depart from his over-polished prefab scripts. It was somewhat embarrassing when, in an obviously planned bit of grandstanding, he (politely) chastised his rivals for neglecting to talk about how much women’s reproductive rights are under attack — only moments after Kamala Harris had made the exact same point, and stirringly so. Booker’s attempt to concede that she’d upstaged him was awkward (a patronizing “God bless Kamala!”) as was his effort to draw a distinction by congratulating himself on being a man who cares about women’s reproductive rights. (It was just grating enough to recall his mortifying “I am Spartacus” gambit during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.) In another demonstration of his lack of intellectual agility, he glowingly quoted the former Trump defense secretary, Jim Mattis, while making no reference to Mattis’s recently much-discussed cowardice in failing to speak up about the White House horrors that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

Biden also lacks that intellectual agility. He didn’t repeat the viral glitches of the previous debates. But that’s a low bar to rise above. Like Booker, he seems incapable of the improvisational moves necessary to take on Trump. He ducked a question about why it was okay for Hunter Biden to trade on his name for cushy foreign paydays, however lawfully, and instead repeated an anodyne soundbite three times (“My son’s statement speaks for itself”). This was a lost opportunity because Biden might have joined other Democrats in denouncing the nepotistic follies of his hypocritical Republican critics, notably Donald Trump Jr., Rand Paul, and Liz Cheney. And he might have passionately lit into the criminal White House conspiracy to strongarm foreign governments to soil him and his son. After all, Trump’s assault on the Bidens is the best argument for his candidacy — it makes the case that Joe Biden is the candidate Trump fears the most. But unaccountably Biden has made only fitful use of this political gift horse in the weeks since the Ukraine scandal became front-page news — even as his campaign’s fundraising has wilted.

There were other examples of his lack of improvisational skills as well. After delivering a meaty tirade against the outrage of Trump’s surrender to Erdogan and Assad, he ducked the question of whether he’d send American troops back into the region. He couldn’t stop himself from repeating more than once his newly favored shtick (intended as a stab at Warren) trumpeting himself as the only candidate who’s gotten anything done. That claim is not only false, but is wielded as a dodge to avoid any treacherous policy question. Worse, it left him open to this memorable riposte from Bernie Sanders: “You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.” Sanders damaged Biden in a less explicit way as well. Post–heart attack, he seemed looser, sharper, and less programmed than he did pre–heart attack. He seems younger than Biden though in fact he’s two years his senior. Who would have ever imagined that Bernie Sanders could be a comeback kid?

Among the others still left standing, Kamala Harris remains an enigma. She’s a sharp and tireless prosecutor (as she never hesitates to remind us), capable of real fire when she’s passionate about the subject at hand. But she’s just as often studied and cautious, and you have to wonder about her political acuity when she marshals her considerable resources to push such a marginal, Bay Area–centric crusade as calling upon Twitter to suspend Trump’s account.

As nearly everyone has noted, the two who did themselves the most good last night were Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who seized the initiative and poked holes in the best-laid Medicare for All plans of front-runner Elizabeth Warren. Their blows, respectful but firm, landed.

For the first time in a debate, Warren occasionally seemed defensive and misspoke. She will not be able to get away indefinitely with stonewalling Buttigieg’s “yes or no question” about whether her health plan mandates tax increases. At another point, she could be found self-righteously claiming that “everyone else on this stage” wants to protect billionaires even though, as Klobuchar pointed out, even the one billionaire onstage, Steyer, had come out against protecting billionaires.

As of now, Warren remains the best candidate the Democrats have, but she hasn’t closed the deal, and there are plausible alternatives. Talking heads at CNN and elsewhere relentlessly promoted last night’s debate as historic because it was the most presidential candidates ever on a debate stage. But only after a ruthless culling will the campaign finally begin in earnest and real history be made.

But what about Michael Bloomberg? He has begun to float the idea of entering the Democratic primary as a centrist option if Biden falters. Would he be a contender?

At 77, he would at last remedy a glaring shortcoming of the septuagenarian Democratic field by filling the age gap between Biden (76) and Sanders (78). And it would be highly gratifying to see a genuinely successful and accomplished New York billionaire go up against the fraud in the White House. He might drive Trump crazy — that is, crazier — and he could be self-financing to an extent.

The downside? Trump’s revenge, make no mistake about it, would be to further stoke anti-Semitism among his alt-right stormtroopers. And should either Buttigieg, Klobuchar, or Harris catch fire with Biden’s up-for-grabs constituency, a tardy Bloomberg candidacy would be fighting a two-front war against opponents both in the party’s center and on the left. If he really wants to get in when Biden falters, someone should tell him that that time has arrived."

Joe Biden has a dire warning for voters who’ve been seduced by single-payer advocates’ sweet nothings: In Bernie Sanders’s socialist dystopia, the typical American worker would see a small percentage of her income deducted from each paycheck, so as to finance her health-insurance coverage.

The Biden campaign disseminated this harrowing prophecy over Twitter, during Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

Biden’s framing certainly makes Medicare for All sound prohibitively expensive. But let’s follow the former vice-president’s lead, and put this matter in perspective.

In 2018, Canada spent roughly 11 percent of its GDP on health care. Under its single-payer insurance model, that investment was enough to provide every Canadian with premium, free access to the world’s 14th-highest-performing health-care system.

That same year, the United States spent 18 percent of its GDP on health care — which, under our system, was inadequate to provide any form of insurance to nearly 30 million Americans, nor to prevent 50 percent of our people from delaying or forgoing medical care due to affordability concerns. For these reasons, among others, America’s exorbitant investment in its medical sector has bought us the world’s 29th-ranked health-care system. That places the wealthiest country in human history just behind the Czech Republic on the small matter of caring for its ill.

Unlike Canadian citizens, Americans do not have to pay taxes to support a universal public insurance system. But that 18 percent of GDP doesn’t come from nowhere. The vast majority of U.S. adults see health insurance as a mandatory expense. As a practical matter, their private insurance premiums function as de facto taxes — obligatory payments deducted from their paychecks to finance a form of social protection. As a legal matter, meanwhile, U.S. federal law still mandates that all Americans secure insurance coverage (although the penalty for not doing so has been set to zero). Thus, in both an essential and technical sense, the typical American worker is compelled by government policy to fork over a hefty percentage of their wages to private insurers.

If Biden acknowledged this reality — which is to say, if he ignored the superficial distinction between payroll taxes and premium payments — he would find (presumably, to his horror) that the U.S. already taxes labor income at one of the highest rates of any country in the OECD. As Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project has shown, the “compulsory payment rate” for a married U.S. worker with two kids was 43.2 percent in 2017; for an analogous Canadian, that rate was 11.5 percent.

No honest observer can look at this data and conclude that single-payer health-care systems are inherently more expensive and inefficient than America’s existing model. Which means that the eye-popping price tag of Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan does not reflect the steep price of socialized medicine, per se. Rather, it reflects the fact that America’s aberrant refusal to impose price controls on its health-care industry has enabled the sector to extract an ever-higher share of national income. Americans spend several times more than their peers in other developed countries on health-care administration, pharmaceuticals, and physicians’ salaries. Although the existing Medicare for All proposals would create some cost savings, they would not fully rectify our overspending problem in the near term. This is, in part, because bringing our payment rates all the way down to the international median in one fell swoop would risk hospital closures and other economic disruptions (and spur massive resistance from powerful and respected interest groups). For these reasons, any plausible proposal for shifting all of America’s health-care costs onto Uncle Sam’s books is bound to look fiscally extravagant. But leaving those costs off the government’s ledger doesn’t make them disappear.

As the right-wing Mercatus Center (accidentally) revealed last year, under one plausible model, Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan would cost the U.S. $32.6 trillion over a decade — while simply maintaining our existing health-care system would cost $34.65 trillion. Which is to say, establishing single-payer would save us $2 trillion in national income, while guaranteeing all Americans affordable health care. But it would also require U.S. workers to make compulsory social insurance payments to the government rather than to private insurers.

And for Joe Biden, that’s apparently a deal-breaker.

At this week’s debate in Ohio, Biden and other moderate Democrats hammered Elizabeth Warren for refusing to state explicitly that her Medicare for All plan would require raising taxes on the middle class. The Massachusetts senator did not deny that her proposal would involve such tax hikes. But she refused to utter the T-word. Instead, she merely promised that she would never sign a health-care bill that didn’t lower the middle-class’s overall costs.

It was more than fair for the debate moderators to press Warren on her evasiveness. Journalists should always work to expose the trade-offs inherent in politicians’ proposals. But Warren’s caginess was rooted in the media’s failure to apply such scrutiny universally. Democrats campaigning on plans that would retain America’s redundant insurance bureaucracies were not asked how they could justify such an extravagance. Under the norms of mainstream political journalism, costs imposed on the American people by the private sector require no justification or defense; only costs imposed by the public sector do. If you are committed to abetting the meteoric rise of private health-insurance premiums, a debate moderator will not ask you to level with the American people about how much your approach to health-care policy will cost them. If you are committed to reducing overall health-care costs by expanding the public sector’s role in medical provision, you will be ritually scolded for the extraordinary (and extraordinarily decontextualized) fiscal price of your program.

As the party that favors higher levels of taxation and public provision, Democrats have an interest in contesting this norm. Biden’s agenda may be less ambitious than Sanders or Warren’s. But he still (officially) aims to raise taxes and increase spending by trillions of dollars. A political discourse that treats taxation as presumptively suspect (even as it treats private rentierism as presumptively legitimate) will not be a favorable one for any Democratic president. Amy Klobuchar, who criticized Warren for her secret middle-class tax hike Tuesday night, is a co-sponsor of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would finance an entitlement to paid family leave with a small increase in payroll taxes. When the Klobuchar administration pushes for that law’s passage, it will want its policy to be judged on the basis of its impact on the median family’s overall costs, not their overall tax bill. And yet, in attacking single-payer Tuesday night, Klobuchar implicitly endorsed the opposite criterion. Equating support for middle-class families with opposition to increasing their tax rates is a conservative project. There is no reason for any Democratic candidate to be advancing it — no matter their position on single-payer.

There are arguments against the existing Medicare for All proposals that do not involve demonizing the very concept of tax-financed social programs. Some of these are logistical (Sanders has neglected to detail various aspects of his transition plan). The most compelling, though, is purely political. At present, there are 14 votes in the U.S. Senate for Bernie’s single-payer bill. In the best-case scenario, Jon Tester will be the pivotal vote in the upper chamber in 2021. Given these facts, there is little basis for believing that Medicare for All will be legislatively viable in the medium-term future, no matter who wins the 2020 election. After all, six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and an avalanche of industry cash will insulate anti-single-payer Senate Democrats incumbents against popular pressure in support of the proposal.

And there’s no guarantee that popular pressure would be forthcoming. The vast majority of available polling indicates that a public option is much more popular with voters than single-payer. One can reasonably attribute this result to the aforementioned biases in our political discourse. But no Democratic nominee will be able to eradicate those biases next summer.

If Medicare for All is not legislatively viable and a public option is more electorally expedient, then there is a case for the Democratic nominee to campaign on the latter. After all, the stakes of denying Donald Trump a second term are extremely high. How one calculates the potential electoral cost of running on a somewhat less popular health-care policy — let alone how one weighs that cost against the potential long-term benefits of popularizing single-payer (a more efficient and just mode of health-care provision) — is inescapably subjective. But given the balance of forces in the Senate, deferring to public opinion on health care so as to maximize the probability of Trump’s eviction from the White House next year, strikes me as a choice a genuinely progressive politician could make.

There is no electoral argument, however, for engaging in anti-tax demagoguery. Biden could emulate his old boss and endorse single-payer in principle, but insist that the country is not yet ready for it. Or he could steal Mayor Pete’s line, and say that he trusts the American people to eventually discover the superiority of publicly provided insurance, once they’re given the option. Instead, he’s opted for a needlessly reactionary mode of attack that will damage Warren or Sanders electorally, should they win the nomination, and undermine any future Democratic president legislatively, should the party regain the chance to govern."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) says the “principal reason” for jobs losses is trade policy, not automation. But economists aren’t so sure.",2019-10-17,The Washington Post,Are jobs lost due to ‘bad trade policy’ or automation?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/17/are-jobs-lost-due-bad-trade-policy-or-automation/,"This is an interesting economic debate, so we wanted to take our time on a fact check, rather than whipping something up on deadline. So how on target is Warren?

The Facts

The notion that automation, rather than trade policies such as allowing China to join the World Trade Organization, is more responsible for a loss of manufacturing jobs has gained currency in recent years. One often-cited report is via researchers at Ball State University, who estimated nearly 88 percent of the decline in manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2010 can be attributed to “productivity,” i.e. via automation, and just 13.4 percent attributed to trade.

AD

AD

This conclusion is sharply disputed, in particular by Susan N. Houseman at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, one of the key sources supplied by the Warren campaign as evidence for her position.

One big issue in the academic research is how one determines the impact of automation vs. trade, especially because interaction is difficult to untangle. For instance, a U.S. company facing competition from China might decide to improve its productivity through increased automation, so the question becomes whether this situation is trade- or automation-related.

Michael Hicks of Ball State University admits his 2015 report represents the lower-bound estimate for the impact of trade and pointed to other research that found the split more like 50-50.

AD

“So, my hunch is that 50 percent is the lower bound on technology losses, 12-15 percent the lower bound on trade losses, and say 35 percent is technology or productivity losses due to trade pressures,” Hicks said. “Of course, none of us use the same dates, so it is hard to make ironclad comparisons.”

AD

Houseman’s 2018 paper offers a sustained critique of the Ball State University findings, saying productivity cannot so easily be attributed to automation. In particular, she said a relatively small sector of manufacturing — computers and electronic products — is responsible for most of the growth in labor productivity. “The productivity gains in the computer industry largely reflect dramatic improvements in the speed and functionality of computers and related products, not automation of the production process,” she wrote. (There’s been a long-running dispute over whether the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis correctly measures manufacturing output in the computer sector.)

“While there is a clear causal link between trade (especially China) and the decline in manufacturing employment, the evidence that automation caused the declines in manufacturing employment is at best mixed, the preponderance of studies failing to find a causal link,” Houseman told The Fact Checker. “Intuitively and quite simply, there doesn’t seem to have been a technology shock that could have caused a 20 to 30 percent decline in manufacturing employment in the space of a decade.”

AD

Another approach is offered by Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, who studied the impact of robots on U.S. labor markets between 1990 and 2007. A footnote in their paper suggests robots reduced employment by about 750,000 jobs between 1993 and 2007; estimates of the impact of China trade are about 2½ times as large, according to some estimates.

AD

“Note, however, that robots are just one type of automation,” Acemoglu told The Fact Checker. “If you put other types of automation technologies, it is probably to be comparable to China trade, but we don’t have as reliable estimates of the impact of things such as numerically controlled machines, computerized numerical control and dedicated automated machinery.”

(The time frame used by the studies could also affect the results. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research noted that manufacturing jobs had declined as a share of total employment gradually since the 1960s, but jumped sharply between 2000 and 2007 when the trade deficit doubled as a percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Meanwhile, for the past nine years — past the period of most recent research — manufacturing jobs have gradually increased, despite the supposed impact of automation, he noted.)

AD

The Warren campaign also sent us a 2017 report issued by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan group funded at least in part by technology companies, that said “a growing minority of analysts” attribute “a significant share of the [job] losses to increased trade pressure and dwindling U.S. competitiveness” rather than technology. “ITIF’s supporters include a diverse range of corporations, charitable foundations, and government entities, and its board includes representatives of leading companies in the tech sector,” said Robert Atkinson, ITIF’s president. Facebook and Amazon, which Warren has proposed breaking up, “both have seats on ITIF’s board and are supporters,” he said.

AD

“Our central estimates suggest that more have been lost from trade with China, but automation is very important, as well, so one has to think about what ‘principal reason’ means,” Acemoglu said. “If it means ‘the most important factor,’ that would not be wrong. If it means ‘predominant cause,’ then it’s wrong.”

There is “no dispute that [trade] contributed,” Hicks said. “I don’t think anyone suggests it was the prime cause.”

AD

The Warren campaign pointed to a study, looking at the period 1999-2018 for the decline in the employment-population ratio, that cited two major contributing factors — import competition from China and adoption of industrial robots — and a host of contributing factors. Import competition was listed as twice as important as robots, but Hicks noted “even by this table trade is half the impact.” (The calculation of the impact of industrial robots was based on the Acemoglu/Restrepo research, but as Acemoglu noted, there are other types of automation his research does not capture.)

AD

“I would say that the preponderance of the evidence points to the greater importance of trade as compared to automation, specifically in the large decline in manufacturing employment in the 2000s,” Houseman said. “However, as I’ve pointed out, one can’t decompose the employment decline into the part caused by ‘trade’ and the part caused by ‘automation,’ both because no [valid] study examines all aspects of trade/automation and their general equilibrium effects, and often the two forces interact.”

The Pinocchio Test

Be wary of politicians who speak with certainty about economic research. The issues are complex and not easily tossed off in a sound bite. Yet Warren said “bad trade policy” was the “principal reason” for job loss, dismissing concerns about automation. She’s even written that blaming job loss on automation is “not true.”

AD

AD

The available research suggests she speaks with too much certainty. Even researchers who do not accept the Ball State findings are not willing to go as far as Warren, in part because more research needs to be done in untangling the interplay between trade and automation.

This reminds of the time when we awarded then President Barack Obama Two Pinocchios — our equivalent of “half true” — for speaking with such certainty on the impact of a higher minimum wage on jobs. We noted then that Obama could have been more accurate with just a few tweaks to his language. Warren also could have not been so definitive. She earns Two Pinocchios as well.

“Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation,” she added in a series of tweets. “Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again — and profit off of it.”

This month, Facebook declined to take down an ad from Trump’s campaign that contained falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden, prompting widespread criticism from the party. Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, which had requested its removal, similarly expressed outrage with Zuckerberg after his Georgetown speech. Biden spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement that the Facebook leader cloaked company policy “in a feigned concern for free expression.”

Zuckerberg’s remarks Thursday were a rare, public attempt to explain his vision of free expression in the digital age. He called on the United States to set an example for tailored regulation, and stressed that Facebook must stand strong against governments that seek to “pull back” on free speech in the face of heightened social and political tensions.

In doing so, Zuckerberg defended the company’s policy around political ads. “I think we’re in the right place on this,” he told The Washington Post in an interview before his address. “In general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.""

Zuckerberg presented his beliefs — that societies tend to regret the instances in which they limit one’s right to express their views — through the lens of history, at one point citing King, his letter from Birmingham jail and his arrests for peaceful protest.

But the Facebook leader’s remarks soon raised eyebrows with a member of King’s family: his daughter, Bernice King. The civil rights leader tweeted she hoped to help Zuckerberg “understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,” adding that such campaigns “created an atmosphere for his assassination.”

Writing in The Post, Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, raised additional alarms, saying she feared Zuckerberg is “ill-equipped” to address the threat of voter suppression. She cited the attempts by Russian agents during the 2016 election to divide Facebook users on issues of race, specifically targeting African American users, and she highlighted the possibility that a politician could try to discourage turnout among people of color.

In response, Facebook said Friday it plans to host Bernice King for meetings at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters next week. “Their perspectives are critically important and we are committed to continuing the ongoing dialogue,” Roberta Thomson, a spokeswoman for the tech giant, said about the reaction from civil rights leaders. “Our work is far from over.”

Free speech advocates, meanwhile, exited Zuckerberg’s speech with conflicting feelings — supportive of his clarion call for governments and private-sector companies to help users express themselves while questioning whether the tech giant’s policies meet its top executive’s own vision.

“He’s sitting and talking to American college students at Georgetown, but who’s he really talking to — it’s live-streamed around the world — is a global audience,” said Kate Klonick, a fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School who is studying Facebook’s work. “I think, at the end of the day, that is a good thing.”

But Klonick said the reality is more complicated, pointing to the fact that some researchers feel Facebook “is not consistent” when it comes to enforcing its own rules.

Facebook maintains detailed policies prohibiting harmful content, including hate speech, terrorist propaganda and violent imagery. Rebecca MacKinnon, director of Ranking Digital Rights, a nonprofit research initiative at New America’s Open Technology Institute, said Facebook had been too opaque about how those standards are enforced. She pointed to her organization’s 2019 report, which found Facebook provided too little detail about content it removes at the requests of governments or third parties, including on the two other social services it owns, WhatsApp and Instagram.

“He glossed over a lot of issues that relate to how speech is organized, optimized, and moderated on the platform currently,” she said. “That has huge impact on society and on human rights.”

“I hope it pushes organizations and individuals and whomever to hold Facebook accountable on this,” added Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “You talk the talk, and now you’ve got to walk the walk.”

Kamala D. Harris of California, a Democratic presidential contender, asked the company to suspend Trump’s account, claiming his online communications “put people at risk and our democracy in danger.”

AD

Appearing at the fourth Democratic presidential debate, Harris on Tuesday again assailed Twitter, charging the president had weaponized the platform “to openly intimidate witnesses” in the ongoing impeachment investigation. She said his account should be removed as a “matter of safety and corporate accountability.”

AD

The dispute stems from Twitter’s announcement this summer that it would label tweets from world leaders whose comments violate site policies, including those designed to prevent harm and abuse. The rules were designed to strike a balance between the public’s right to know and Twitter’s efforts to ensure hate speech, misinformation and other troubling content do not go viral.

But Twitter’s application of the policy ultimately invited widespread criticism, after the company opted not to label a number of Trump’s tweets Democrats and digital watchdogs saw as improper. In July, for instance, the president told four congresswomen of color to “go back” to their countries, a tweet widely criticized as a racist attack in violation of Twitter’s rules against hate speech.

AD

In an attempt to clarify its rules, Twitter said Tuesday it would take enforcement actions against “any account” in certain, dire circumstances, including instances when a world leader threatens a user with direct violence or publishes private information, such as a home address.

AD

But Twitter also noted there were cases when the company may not act, such as when heads of state have “direct interactions” with their peers or engage in “foreign policy saber rattling on economic and military issues,” which it said are not violations of rules. Nor would the company seek to “determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,” it said.

For those tweets that are labeled as violations, Twitter said it would also take steps to limit their spread on the site: Users would not be able to retweet or like that content, for example. The company said it has not yet applied this label.

AD

“With critical elections and shifting political dynamics around the world, we recognize that we’re operating in an increasingly complex and polarized political culture,” Twitter said. “These are constantly evolving challenges and we’ll keep our policies and approach under advisement, particularly as we learn more about the relationship between tweets from world leaders and the potential for offline harm.

AD

The clarification did not immediately satisfy the company’s critics. In response to Twitter’s updated policies, Ian Sams, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, said, “When Trump is using his tweets to make threats, incite violence and intimidate witnesses, this is insufficient.”

The request for stricter enforcement of company guidelines — and the update from Twitter — have come amid rising Democratic anger with the laissez-faire attitude adopted by technology giants toward politicians. Trump has made prolific use of the platforms, bypassing mainstream gatekeepers to speak directly to his supporters.

AD

In an Oct. 1 letter to Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, Harris, a former attorney general of California, cited examples of Trump’s tweets that disparaged the whistleblower who brought forth concerns about the president’s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart.

AD

Trump described the individual, who is a member of the intelligence community, as a “so-called ‘Whistleblower,’” and said, “I deserve to meet my accuser.” He also leveled a baseless accusation of treason, which can carry the death penalty, against Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who is leading the impeachment inquiry that could threaten his presidency.

Harris said the messages amounted to an attempt “to target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower.""

AD

“Others have had their accounts suspended for less offensive behavior,” she wrote. “And when this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

Earlier this month, Facebook declined a request from former vice president Joe Biden’s campaign to take down a Trump ad that included a debunked claim about his family’s involvement with a Ukrainian gas company. The company cited its policy of exempting political speech from its fact-checking program.

AD

That drew a rebuke from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has proposed breaking up Silicon Valley giants in her bid for the Democratic nomination. She called Facebook a “disinformation-for-profit machine.”

The update from Twitter on Tuesday shows, however, that the conundrum facing social media companies extends far beyond paid advertising. The megaphone they offer politicians — including those with a penchant for mistruths — can be just as valuable and just as fraught.

AD

AD

The operation demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the schisms within the Democratic Party as it labors to choose a nominee to face Trump in 2020. One Russian account, which portrayed itself as a black voter in Michigan, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to hammer Biden for gaffes about racial issues. Some of the accounts boosted one of his rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

The Russian network was the subject of one of four takedowns Facebook announced Monday; it also disabled three misleading campaigns originating in Iran. Researchers said the efforts demonstrated how those seeking to interfere in U.S. politics continue to exploit radioactive topics, including racial and religious fault lines. And they said it offered fresh evidence that foreign actors are pursuing new platforms that rely on a steady stream of images, making detection more difficult despite Facebook’s heightened investments in election security.

“We are seeing again that the aim of the Russians is not exclusively to favor one candidate over another but to create divisiveness within the electorate overall,” said Paul M. Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. “The reason that networks of phony accounts are drawn to Instagram is because disinformation is increasingly visual in nature, and that’s what Instagram specializes in.”

AD

AD

The disclosure from Facebook served as more evidence of what Trump has repeatedly questioned — that Russian actors not only interfered in the 2016 election but are continuing their efforts to interfere in American democracy. The task of safeguarding U.S. elections from interference by Russia and other foreign actors has been a source of tension in the Trump administration, with the president repeatedly calling the allegations of Russian involvement in 2016 a “hoax” and top security officials being forced to tiptoe around the issue.

Multiple U.S. investigations have confirmed the extent of Russia’s attempt to interfere in the 2016 presidential race. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III obtained multiple indictments last year of individuals affiliated with the Internet Research Agency. This month, a bipartisan report produced by Senate investigators concluded again that the Russian effort sought to boost Trump and undermine Clinton in the eyes of social media users.

Speaking to The Washington Post last week, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the problem posed by disinformation has worsened since 2016, and he attributed that in part to a poor initial response by the U.S. government to the threat. “Unfortunately, the U.S. did not have a particularly strong response to Russia after 2016,” he said, “so it sent the signal to other countries that they could get in on this, too.”

AD

AD

Facebook’s announcements came two days before Zuckerberg is set to appear on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are likely to press him on the company’s work to safeguard U.S. elections from foreign manipulation. Members of Congress have upbraided the tech giant for missing key warning signs of Russian interference before the 2016 election, then failing to acknowledge the Kremlin’s activities immediately after the fact.

Zuckerberg said in an interview last week that Facebook is in a “much better place now” to stop disinformation campaigns, citing the company’s investments in tens of thousands of new staff hires and artificial intelligence that can spot fake accounts and dubious posts in real time. The company further fine-tuned its policies Monday, pledging to more prominently alert users when viral content is determined to be false. Announcing the changes, Zuckerberg stressed he now has “some confidence our systems here are working.”

“Elections have changed significantly since 2016,” he told reporters, “and Facebook has changed, too.”

Researchers said Facebook — in spotting and disclosing the Russian network Monday faster than it had in the past — demonstrated it had improved its digital defenses. Companies such as Facebook are “building muscle memory around understanding malicious actors on their platform,” said Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.

But Brookie said Facebook’s takedown showed that Russia’s tactics would continue to evolve as well. “To steal a phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words, and meme-based content is still extremely effective and much harder to detect,” he said.

The Biden campaign applauded Facebook for disabling the fake accounts but said Trump’s penchant for falsehoods posed just as great a challenge for the company, which has refused to fact-check political advertising placed by the president’s reelection campaign.

AD

“Unfortunately, like the Kremlin, Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, [and] all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform,” TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump’s ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.”

Facebook described the Russian network as a “well-resourced operation” focused on the United States and reliant on sophisticated steps to conceal the identity and location of those behind the fake accounts. It comprised 50 accounts on Instagram and one on Facebook, all of them created this year.

The network appeared still to be in an audience-building phase when it was removed by Facebook: 246,000 accounts followed one or more of the inauthentic Russian accounts, which had collectively made just fewer than 75,000 posts, according to a report from Graphika, a social media analysis firm that examined the operation for Facebook. Only one account, which addressed environmental themes, had more than 20,000 followers.

AD

AD

Much of the content lacked text, consisting only of memes, and the posts often drew from viral content first posted by American actors, including news organizations and prominent political figures, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

The accounts had not yet developed their own voice, which analysts say is critical to achieving a mass following.

“These accounts were trying really hard to hide,” said Ben Nimmo, Graphika’s director of investigations. “The more you try to blend in, the less you stand out. And the less you stand out, the less you’re going to attract an audience. It looks like these accounts were sacrificing engagement for security. That’s a very defensive strategy.”

AD

Nimmo said Facebook’s action was at least the fourth takedown since 2017 of operations targeting the United States that seemed to bear links to the Internet Research Agency. The apparent connection to the St. Petersburg company and “troll farm,” owned by an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, went beyond overlap with the thematic focus and targets of past Kremlin-backed campaigns. Some of the accounts taken down Monday had posted memes already attributed to previous IRA efforts — but had sought to rebuild them from scratch, rather than simply reposting them, and had made attempts to remove the original IRA watermarks.

AD

A minority of the posts focused explicitly on the 2020 election, according to Graphika’s analysis. Among the accounts posing as backers of political and social causes in the United States, the largest cluster was conservative and in support of Trump. Numerous accounts aimed their fire at Democratic candidates — namely Biden but also Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Other issues included racial activism, Confederate pride, gun rights, LGBT issues, feminism, Islam and Christianity.

Nearly half of the accounts claimed to be based in swing states, with a specific focus on Florida.

AD

Biden came under attack from accounts that positioned themselves on both sides of the political spectrum. One account reposted a tweet from a right-wing political commentator parroting a Trump rebuke of Biden, while another posted a meme showing a road diverging and a car swerving to choose the path representing “Bernie 2020” over “Joe Biden.” Four years earlier, Russian-backed Facebook accounts similarly promoted Sanders during the Democratic primary against Clinton, according to Senate investigators."

Beto O’Rourke could have been a contender. In 2018, the extremely tall, incredibly Gen-X congressman mounted the most impressive failed Senate campaign in modern memory. O’Rourke came a couple points short of evicting Ted Cruz from the upper chamber. But he persuaded no small number of Republicans to check the box next to his name — and mobilized enough left-leaning voters to paint wide swathes of Texas’s court system blue. Through tireless campaigning, and a message that celebrated transpartisan understanding while upholding progressive values, O’Rourke advanced the cause of criminal-justice reform in the present and laid the groundwork for statewide Democratic victories in the future.

He could have built on that triumph by taking a run on John Cornyn’s Senate seat in 2020, or founding an organization dedicated to turning Texas blue, or plotting a return to the House of Representatives, or doing countless other useful (or at least harmless) things.

Instead, he opted to mount a feeble presidential campaign — and then to rage against the dying of its light by adopting needlessly divisive stances on culture-war issues, thereby nullifying his potential value as a statewide candidate in Texas, and providing Rupert Murdoch’s state media channel with its ideal foil.

The 2020 campaign overexposed Beto minutes after he entered it. The Texan’s approach to oratory — saying pluckily inoffensive things in a singsongy rhythm while gesticulating furiously — was charming when juxtaposed with Ted Cruz’s sociopathic debate-nerd shtick. Placed beside more experienced and informed politicians (who are not suspected serial killers), O’Rourke’s “what if Obama, but white and less talented?” persona proved less compelling. The mayor of South Bend quickly established himself as the more attractive, gratuitously unqualified, and milquetoast young white man.

O’Rourke enjoyed a brief resurgence of relevance in the wake of the white nationalist mass murder in El Paso, when he boiled blue America’s expaseration with the media’s amnesia about Donald Trump’s unabashed racism down to the phrase, “Members of the press, what the fuck?” But then the El Paso shooting became history. And Beto’s cathartic cussing became a T-shirt.

Alas, that little blip of affirmation apparently convinced O’Rourke that he should break more taboos that highly engaged liberals wish to see smashed. Thus, when asked at September’s debate whether his plans for gun reform stopped at banning the sale of new assault rifles — or involved confiscating the existing toys of firearm enthusiasts — Beto endorsed the latter proposition. “In Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour,” O’Rourke replied. “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.”

O’Rourke then followed up his “yes we can send jackbooted thugs to confiscate your guns” pledge by vowing to direct the power of the state against anti-LGBT churches:

Don Lemon: Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities — should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?

Beto O’Rourke: Yes. There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone, any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights, that denies the full civil rights, of everyone in America. So as president, we’re going to make that a priority. And we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.

Understandably, many progressives found O’Rourke’s refusal to placate red America on these points refreshing. Surely, no decent society should have millions of AR-15s in circulation. And why should our tax dollars subsidize institutions that promote bigotry in the name of tradition?

I, for one, would certainly favor mandatory buybacks if it were politically and logistically feasible (I’d also love for the state to take just about all the guns, and then disarm the cops while we’re at it). Beto’s support for conditioning the tax-exempt status of religious institutions on whether he approves of their teaching seems substantively bad (and unconstitutional) to me. But if I had my druthers, I’d probably have the state get out of the religion-subsidizing business entirely.

And if Beto had his druthers, he’d be a serious presidential candidate. Which is to say: We can’t always get what we want in this life. Although a couple of polls have found narrow majority support for mandatory AR-15 buybacks, others show the policy underwater. Given that the U.S. Senate wildly overrepresents rural areas that lean right of the nation on gun issues, and that liberals have struggled for decades to enact gun reforms that poll at 90 percent, it’s safe to say that O’Rourke’s proposal will not be legislatively viable on the federal level at any point in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the policy isn’t even a slam dunk on the merits, once one considers the risks inherent to sending armed agents of the state to confiscate the weapons of paranoid gun nuts, and/or orchestrating high-tension encounters between police officers and suspected assault-weapon owners in marginalized communities. Julián Castro eloquently spotlighted the latter hazard Tuesday night.

Nevertheless, in an interview on MSNBC Wednesday morning, O’Rourke doubled down on literal confiscation.

.@BetoORourke says if someone refuses to turn in their AR-15s then ""in that case I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm...""https://t.co/i0eRK7w63H pic.twitter.com/QdxsBV7Kyr — Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) October 16, 2019

This is wildly unproductive. Mandatory buybacks are legislatively impossible, logistically nightmarish, and politically unwise. Elections are won and lost at the margins. There is little-to-no evidence that embracing more ideologically extreme positions spurs higher turnout among unreliable Democratic voters (who tend to be more conservative than reliable ones, especially on social issues). There are a significant number of Americans who oppose Donald Trump but lean right on gun issues. There’s no reason for Democrats to go out of their way to antagonize such voters by embracing relatively unpopular, legislatively nonviable gun reforms. And there is even less reason for O’Rourke to do so. The man is not going to be the Democrats’ 2020 nominee, but he could have used this campaign to fortify his status as a strong candidate for statewide office in Texas. Getting to Elizabeth Warren’s left on firearms probably disqualifies him from that consolation prize. And one can essentially say all these same things about his stance on the tax-exempt status of anti-LGBT churches.

But O’Rourke took his campaign’s malign uselessness to new heights Tuesday night, when he had the temerity to scold Warren for the divisiveness of her wealth tax. After allowing that a levy on the wealth of billionaires might be “part of the solution” to inequality, the man who had just called for siccing big government on Catholic churches and gun owners said the following:

Sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.

Beto ""Hell yes, I'm going to take your AR-15"" O'Rourke is really preaching about unity and how Elizabeth Warren is ""pitting some part of the country against each other, instead of lifting people up.""



Politicians are the worst. pic.twitter.com/BNFPtbAJyp — Caleb SkHull 💀🎃👻 (@CalebJHull) October 16, 2019

In that moment, it seemed almost plausible that O’Rourke was, in truth, a GOP sleeper agent — or else a Tucker Carlson caricature of elite liberalism come to life. Taxing the wealth of billionaires is popular with a broad, bipartisan majority of Americans. The GOP’s greatest liability with marginal Trump voters is the perception that they’re the party of the superrich and corporations. To the extent that Democrats can make inroads into red America, increasing the salience of popular progressive ideas for equalizing economic power is their best bet for doing so. Warren’s wealth tax represents a step in the direction. By contrast, Beto’s efforts to spotlight relatively unpopular liberal ideas on culture-war issues, while decrying populist rhetoric as punitive and divisise, are music to Republican operatives’ ears.

O’Rourke’s 2018 campaign was a vital contribution to the fight against reactionary rule in the U.S. He deserves some measure of admiration for mounting it. But his presidential bid has accomplished nothing beyond costing his party a promising candidate in the Lone Star State. The longer he drags out this increasingly counterproductive, quixotic crusade, the harder it will be to avoid the question: Members of Beto’s campaign, what the fuck?"

It’s been a roller-coaster couple of weeks for the Trump administration, and for wild-eyed allies telling on themselves for their roles and intentions in Ukraine. Today, the blurting out of national scandals expanded a few thousand miles eastward, when the president encouraged China to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden.

“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened in Ukraine,” Trump said on the South Lawn, without giving any context for what he was talking about. (The president appears to be referring to allegations stemming from an official White House trip in 2013. Hunter Biden tagged along, and shortly after the visit, a private-equity fund for which he served as a board member received an infusion of Chinese capital; he reportedly has not received any money from the fund related to his board seat.)

According to a report on CNN, this eruption from the president wasn’t spontaneous. In a phone call with President Xi from June 18, Trump brought up Biden and Elizabeth Warren and mentioned that he wouldn’t comment on the protests in Hong Kong as China and the U.S. pursued an end to the trade war. The record of the call was then dumped in the top-secret server that the Ukraine call was stored in — the one that the whistle-blower revealed in his complaint that also contains conversations with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman. (Earlier in the week, the White House had not denied that Trump raised Biden in the conversation with Xi.)

As if a second open solicitation of foreign aid in an election wasn’t enough for a Thursday morning, according to CNN, a Trump ally confirmed the seriousness of the president’s request: “One Trump ally outside the White House described receiving a message from Chinese government officials asking if Trump was serious when he suggested China open an investigation into Biden. The response: Investigating corruption is an easy way to earn goodwill with Trump.”

It’s hard to overstate how shortsighted the president’s actions were on the South Lawn — canvassing a second head of state for election aid while facing an impeachment inquiry for the first effort.

Intelligencer staffers Gabriel Debenedetti and Benjamin Hart discuss the possible ramifications of Bernie Sanders’s heart procedure and temporary campaign suspension.

Ben: Bernie Sanders’s campaign revealed today that the 78-year-old Vermont senator underwent a procedure for a blocked artery after experiencing tightness in his chest Tuesday evening. His wife, Jane Sanders, says he is doing “really well,” and there is no indication that more serious health problems are involved. But this is obviously news his supporters don’t want to hear. Do you have an initial sense of how the incident will affect his campaign?

Gabriel: We have no idea how this will affect the campaign, and I’m not sure the campaign does yet, either. In terms of the short-term mechanics, we know Sanders has canceled his upcoming events, and his campaign has postponed its big recent ad buy in Iowa, which was supposed to be a big moment for it. Obviously this isn’t good, but I’d caution against drawing too many conclusions here.

Purely in terms of political momentum, you clearly don’t want your candidate off the trail and off the air at an important moment. But I’m pretty sure most Democratic voters understand the circumstances.

Ben: Voters may understand that Bernie is old, but Joe Biden is the candidate whose age has been more front and center as a possible drawback. Bernie, while older than Biden, has maintained a breakneck campaign schedule and has appeared not to lose a step in the process. Won’t this put a pretty major dent in that image?

Gabriel: What I meant isn’t that voters understand his age, but that they understand there’s a completely understandable reason for his absence from the trail. I don’t want to speculate too much on the potential political fallout here because we just don’t have any idea what the prognosis is, what Sanders’s plan is, or, really, anything. I’d love more information, but clearly the people around him are being very cautious, and that’s extremely understandable. I’m happy to engage more directly with part of the question, though. Not only has Sanders had a breakneck campaign schedule in 2019, he’s had a basically insane schedule since late 2015. He’s been traveling the country more or less nonstop, and his stamina on the trail has always impressed his aides and the reporters who follow him.

Ben: Indeed, I’ve seen some testaments to that on Twitter.

Gabriel: I can attest to it personally!

Ben: Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “My friend @sensanders has always been a strong partner in the Senate. Wishing him a speedy recovery so he can get back in the fight.” Presumably rival candidates will tread extremely carefully around this news.

Gabriel: Of course. I’ve seen similar tweets or statements from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke, Andrew Yang, Julián Castro, Tom Steyer, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet, Marianne Williamson, Tim Ryan, Joe Sestak, Tulsi Gabbard, and John Delaney. And, by the way, Trump’s reelection communications director Tim Murtaugh, too. There’s no realistic world in which candidates try to make political hay out of this moment."

On Friday morning, the president explained that his various attempts to coerce foreign governments into launching baseless investigations into Joe Biden had “NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens” (ostensibly, they were actually about ethics in Ukrainian cronyism).

Also on Friday, Donald Trump’s reelection campaign revealed that it will air $1 million worth of Ukraine-themed, anti-Biden ads in early primary states.

Team Trump had previously announced an $8 million national television blitz promoting the (unsubstantiated) claim that Joe Biden leveraged the powers of the vice-presidency to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired for investigating the company that employed his son. But it wasn’t clear until Friday that roughly $1 million of that ad buy would be concentrated in Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Nevada, in a naked attempt to prevent Biden from securing the Democratic nomination.

“Voters should know about the self-dealing, influence-peddling Bidens as the campaign season progresses,” Tim Murtaugh, a Trump 2020 spokesman, told Politico Friday.

The Biden campaign had already made a $6 million ad buy in those same states with the aim of countering Trump’s Ukraine allegations. But if this exchange of fire turns into ad war of attrition, the former vice-president could be in trouble: In the third quarter of this year, Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee collectively raised $125 million; Biden, meanwhile, raised a mere $15 million (which was considerably less than the socialist candidate and mayor of South Bend had each mustered).

None of this seems ideal for a candidate who was already losing ground to Elizabeth Warren before his son’s legal (but shady) employment on the board of a Ukrainian gas company became a fixture in the headlines. Polls suggest that Democratic primary voters prize “electability” in their nominee above all else. And the former vice-president’s strong showing in surveys of a hypothetical Trump-Biden election had helped to give his candidacy an aura of safety. But Biden’s egregious ineloquence at the first Democratic debates put a dent in that aura. Now, Trump’s ad campaign threatens to persuade Democrats in early states that nominating Biden would, in fact, mean reliving “but her emails” all over again.

On the other hand, it’s hard to imagine stronger evidence for the claim “Donald Trump is more afraid of facing Biden than any other candidate” than the Trump campaign taking out a multimillion-dollar ad buy aimed at sparing the president the hassle of facing Biden. Thus, it’s conceivable that Uncle Joe can use the president’s ad blitz (and monstrous abuse of power) to his own benefit.

“Donald Trump is interfering in our party’s primary election to destroy my campaign with proven lies. Are you going to let him win?” seems like a potent message (if Biden can deliver it without going off on a tangent about phonographs, or the time Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in the late 1970s, anyway)."

Around halfway through the fourth Democratic debate, middle-of-the-packers Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke engaged in a heated exchange over O’Rourke’s mandatory buyback proposal for assault weapons. After the former Texas rep criticized the South Bend mayor’s more moderate policies on gun reform, Buttigieg responded that he did not “need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,” perhaps alluding to his military service as a greater sacrifice than Beto’s great Gen X Battle of Making It in New York.

O’Rourke — who has prioritized gun reform following the El Paso shooting in August — then brought up Buttigieg’s insult from a gun-safety forum in Las Vegas earlier in October, when he called O’Rourke’s policy a “shiny object,” claiming that prior gun-buyback attempts had largely resulted in handovers of antiques and heirlooms. Addressing the earlier dig, O’Rourke said:

Mayor Buttigieg described this policy as a shiny object. I don’t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but for those who have survived gun violence, those who have lost a loved one to an AR-15 or an AK-47 — March for Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians — that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass-casualty assault … They must buy them back.

The field also weighed in on the issue: Amy Klobuchar, like Buttigieg, vowed to pursue policies with popular support, like the boyfriend loophole. Elizabeth Warren supported voluntary gun buybacks, while Kamala Harris repeated her call for mandatory buybacks.

Julián Castro closed the topic with a strong statement on his problems with mandatory buybacks: that “folks can’t define it,” and that the increased contact with police that could be required by such a policy would represent a danger to black and brown communities:

In the places that I grew up in, we weren’t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. Y’all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at two in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn’t even announce himself, and within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home. And so I’m not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that.

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

It’s been a weird week or so for the presidential campaign of U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D–Hawaii). She announced and then abandoned plans to boycott the Democratic-candidate debate in Ohio after denouncing it as the product of a DNC/“corporate media” plot to rig the nominating contest. At the debate itself, she didn’t get much attention other than some raised eyebrows for saying this (according to the Washington Post’s transcript):

I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she’s correct.

Actually, although Clinton did use that language (famously deployed by her husband in 1992) in her 2008 campaign, she’d abandoned it by 2016 in response to a growing concern from reproductive-rights advocates that the “rare” part demonized women who wanted to have abortions, which were, after all, mostly legal. I don’t know whether this comment annoyed HRC, but in any event, she sure as hell unloaded on Gabbard a couple of days later, as Axios noted:

Hillary Clinton said on David Plouffe’s podcast, Campaign HQ, this week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D–Hawaii) is Russia’s “favorite” 2020 candidate and said the country could be “grooming” her to become a third-party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She’s the favorite of the Russians …”

Clinton didn’t finger Gabbard by name, but the odds are very high that she was talking about her. Gabbard certainly took it that way and fired back with a tweetstorm of near-Trumpian grandiosity:

Great! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019

... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.



It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don’t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019

Sorry, Elizabeth Warren. Sorry, Joe Biden. Sorry, Bernie Sanders. Sorry, Mayor Pete and Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar and all the others: This primary is between me and you.

While it would most definitely enliven the Democratic race if Clinton leaped in, I would bet the farm I don’t have that, even in that incredibly unlikely event, the race would not wind up being a Clinton-Gabbard throwdown. Perhaps the Hawaiian will get some fresh lefty street cred for saying nasty things about HRC out loud that others have simply thought, though even Hillary haters don’t typically think of her as the “queen of warmongers.” But this is more likely just a bizarre incident in which one pol tossed off a random remark in a podcast and another happily rose to the bait, happy for the attention.

Besides, everybody knows the queen of warmongers is Cersei Lannister, not Hillary Rodham Clinton!"

The “top” candidates talk the most about security policy.

The Democratic candidates have increasingly discussed foreign policy not just on the debate stage, but also on the campaign trail.

AD

One way to track this is by checking how often security has been mentioned in the top candidates’ social media accounts, defining top candidates as those polling above 2 percent support nationally as of the first debate in late June. I collected tweets using the Twitter API and WorkbenchData to pick up references to well-defined foreign affairs, leaving off trade and immigration so as to focus on security-related issues such as Afghanistan, cyberwarfare, U.S.-Iran relations and North Korea.

AD

The three top-tier candidates — using The Washington Post’s most recent ranking of front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have been commenting comparatively often on security issues. Since the June debate, security was the topic of 15.2 percent of Biden’s tweets and 14.5 percent of Warren’s. That’s a significantly larger proportion than those from some of the candidates still working to establish themselves as viable, such as former Housing Secretary Julián Castro with 9.3 percent and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) with 9.1 percent.

Substantively, these messages often focused on the security implications of climate change, driven in part by CNN’s September climate town hall. But they also discussed the future of the Afghanistan mission, veterans’ issues, and U.S.-Russia relations.

AD

2. Republicans’ advantage on national security has faded.

AD

By talking about national security, the top Democratic candidates are working to craft images as potential commanders in chief. That’s more likely to succeed than in years past. Republicans no longer have the monopoly on appearing strong on national security, as traditional party “stereotypes” keep weakening.

In 2014, Gallup found that Americans were 23 percentage points more likely to say Republicans would do better than Democrats at protecting the country from international threats; by 2018, the gap had shrunk to only 6 points. This is compounded by the fact that public approval vs. disapproval for the president’s handling of foreign policy has seen a negative 10-percentage-point swing since summer 2018.

AD

AD

During last week’s debate, the candidates took advantage of that growing gap between the Trump administration’s actions and general American opinion, charting a middle course between respecting the public’s skepticism about intervention abroad while remaining largely opposed to stepping back from key commitments.

The field’s two military veterans — Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) — clashed on the future of U.S. involvement in Syria. But most of the candidates rejected Gabbard’s vision for wholesale departure in favor of Buttigieg’s call for measured engagement. Even Warren, the party’s front-runner and advocate for a decreased presence in the region, remarked that the Islamic State could not be allowed purchase and that withdrawal would have to be done “the right way, the smart way.”

AD

Meanwhile, nearly all the candidates talked about combating Russian political interference in U.S. elections. Biden aimed for the security “middle” by arguing most fervently in favor of renewing support to NATO allies. And Sanders argued for continued mitigation measures on climate change through support for policies like the Green New Deal. While Warren didn’t mention it in the debate, her platform specifically identifies the military as a venue for implementing climate action, calling for limiting military dependence on fossil fuels, hardening facilities against extreme weather and investing billions into research on “microgrids and advanced energy storage.”

AD

3. The Syria withdrawal works to the Democratic candidates’ advantage

AD

Both Booker and former congressman Beto O’Rourke noted the national security community’s disapproval, specifically mentioning retired general and Trump’s former defense secretary Jim Mattis. Invoking Mattis’s past remarks that the United States had two powers in foreign affairs — “intimidation and inspiration” — Booker called for relying on the diplomatic corps to “focus on the latter power.” And Biden similarly drew on the ex-military community’s disapproval for the decision when he explicitly noted that “commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed” of the withdrawal.

AD

As the Democratic field tightens in coming months, we can expect an even larger shake-up in how the candidates and parties position themselves on national security.

Warren’s ad further claims that “if Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they’re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It’s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable — add your name if you agree.”

Warren’s campaign and Facebook’s communications team continued to spar on the subject — on Twitter — well into Saturday night.

Warren (D-Mass.) has called for Facebook to be broken up, an idea that founder Mark Zuckerberg did not like very much. And her latest shot at the platform has continued a debate on disinformation spread by politicians and whether traditional and social media companies have an obligation — or even a right — to curtail them.

Her campaign’s Facebook ad appeared to refer to the controversy surrounding a Trump campaign spot titled “Corruption,” which made false assertions about former vice president Joe Biden and claimed without evidence that the 2020 Democratic presidential contender offered $1 billion to Ukraine to help his son Hunter Biden. It also accused several prominent television journalists of supporting impeachment.

The ad ran as the president finds himself engulfed in scandal, after a whistleblower revealed that Trump appeared to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Those revelations have led House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry.

AD

AD

On Saturday night, Facebook’s communications team tagged Warren in a tweet defending the social media giant’s decision to keep the ad, with a new justification that it had also run on some television stations. The senator hit back, writing, “It’s up to you whether you take money to promote lies.”

Politicians are treated differently than other Facebook users when it come to making false claims on the platform, The Washington Post reported Thursday. Politicians’ statements are not subjected to the same fact-checking scrutiny that other advertisements typically go through, the vice president of global affairs and communications Nick Clegg said last month.

“We do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules,” Clegg said. A subsequent post on Facebook’s website clarified that this policy covered “organic content or ads.”

AD

AD

Facebook’s rationale for not curtailing this content boils down to three points: that they fear encroachment on free speech; that these statements are often newsworthy; and that politicians are already fact-checked.

In a written response to the Biden campaign’s complaints, Katie Harbath, the platform’s public policy director for global elections, said that the company allowed such ads to stand because “our approach is grounded in Facebook’s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.”

On Saturday, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone referred The Washington Post to Clegg’s and Harbath’s previous statements.

AD

Of course, it’s not just Facebook that’s taking heat. Democrats such as presidential candidate Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have called for Twitter to take action on Trump’s account, which he has used to share conspiracy theories and lodge racist and sexist attacks against political opponents. Twitter has long refused to do so.

AD

The networks must thread a difficult needle: how to maintain the least toxic political discourse possible without taking actions that will anger privacy experts and free speech advocates, or trigger outrage from conservatives, who frequently allege that the social networks are biased against them.

But campaigns are spending millions of dollars to push these ads to millions of Americans, and citizens on both sides of the aisle are nervous about a repeat of 2016. Facebook has introduced new tools to make political advertising more transparent, including an Ad Library that documents every ad the campaigns and other political entities have run and how much they’re spending on the platform.

AD

But controversies such as the one that has erupted over Trump’s ad suggest to critics that the platform isn’t doing enough to regulate digital campaigning in 2020. If the Trump campaign can claim that Joe Biden tried to give a billion-dollar bribe to Ukraine, then his potential opponents may be left to wonder: What else are they going to try?

AD

Without any clear sense of where lines are on social media, politicians of both parties will likely continue to cross them. And in response, critics of the platform are likely to continue to push for greater accountability.

The controversial Trump ad in question is no longer running on Facebook. It expired on Oct. 6. But according to the Facebook Ad Library, the Trump campaign has since moved on to ads hawking “Where’s Hunter?” T-shirts.

Bernie Sanders’s Medicare-for-all proposal . Her popularity has surged this fall, putting her in second place or the lead in many polls. Warren’s biggest controversy in the 2020 race came early in the cycle, when she took a DNA test to try to prove claims of Native American heritage. She later apologized after receiving significant backlash.

Warren has emerged as a force in the race for the White House, promising to wield her policy chops to restructure American democracy for the middle class — “I’ve got a plan for that,” has become her unofficial slogan. Warren, 70, is in her second term in the Senate and rose to national prominence by taking on bankers and large corporations. She entered politics in 2011 after working as a law professor and consumer advocate and providing the intellectual basis for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a federal watchdog agency formed in 2010. “Corruption has put our planet at risk. Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy,” Warren said in September at a rally in New York City attended by about 20,000 people.

Climate change Warren released a comprehensive climate change plan in September with inspiration from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who focused on rigorous action to combat climate change. Her plan echoes Inslee’s call to move toward 100 percent clean energy over a 10-year period, placing a $3 trillion price tag on the issue. Warren’s latest climate action blueprint is only one component of her multifaceted approach to fighting climate change. She also has outlined a Green Manufacturing land use plan, a Green Apollo research plan and a green military plan. She says reversing Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations would cover $1 trillion of the plan. “Nothing less than a national mobilization will be required to defeat climate change,” Warren wrote in a Medium post announcing the climate plan.

Education Warren, a former Harvard law professor who spent a year teaching K-12 special education, has made universal free public college tuition and canceling student loan debt for 42 million Americans bedrocks of her campaign. She has also blasted Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and promised that she would choose an educator for that post. Although Warren was the first Democratic candidate to release a policy addressing the costs of higher education for those still paying for it, she is notably quiet on K-12 education. She has yet to release a plan, and her history on the issue sends mixed messages about what public education would look like under a Warren presidency. In the past, she expressed support for charter schools and co-sponsored an amendment upholding standardized test scores as accountability checks, but she has since changed her positions on both of those issues — saying she would ban for-profit charter schools and criticizing “high-stakes testing.” See all candidates

Foreign policy The senator frames the United States’ foreign involvement as an opportunity to defend democracy and question the role of capitalism in exacerbating inequalities worldwide. “Every decision the government makes should be grounded in the recognition that actions that undermine working families in this country ultimately erode American strength in the world,” she wrote in an op-ed in Foreign Affairs in February. Generally cautious about military force, Warren favors ending U.S. involvement in Yemen and opposes military intervention in Syria and Iraq. Her vision for U.S. activity abroad falls in line with a new “progressive foreign policy” that focuses on the distribution of wealth worldwide and the implications of autocratic leadership. See all candidates

Government On an issue that has split Democratic presidential candidates, Warren came out against the electoral college. “I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and makes sure that vote gets counted,” she said at a CNN town hall event in March at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss. Warren also has called for an end to the Senate filibuster and used the importance of passing a firearm background check bill to explain the significance of the 60-vote threshold. In terms of the Supreme Court, Warren is admittedly still figuring out her position. She has said that “all options are on the table,” including term limits and adding justices. She also has called for a national commission to study reparations for slavery. See all candidates

Health care Warren has adopted Sanders’s Medicare-for-all proposal, which would provide all U.S. residents with a government-funded health-care program and eliminate private health insurance. Under pressure to explain the sources of funding for the ambitious proposal, Warren has skirted questions about whether taxes would increase for the middle class. She says that any increase would be more than offset by a reduction in overall costs in premiums, deductibles and medication prices. Warren’s proposal also involves an aggressive plan to target the opioid crisis by allocating $100 billion toward addiction treatment, among other policies. See all candidates"

Although it was not exactly an unpredictable development, the arrival of formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump could change a lot of things for the Democrats hoping to face him in 2020. On the one hand, it has made it easy for impeachment fence-sitters to finally go with the flow, making impeachment itself no longer a divisive campaign issue. On the other hand, it is a massive distraction from the messages the candidates had carefully prepared before and during the early stages of the campaign, as Sean Sullivan observes:

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact …

[T]he drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, “Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.”

There is one candidate, however, who may view the impeachment issue as a possible way to get her mojo back: Kamala Harris. Molly Hensley-Clancy lays out how that might work, and why it could give Harris a boost:

Iowans know what they like about Kamala Harris. They’ve seen it on TV: the sharp-tongued, compassionate, and courageous prosecutor that leaves them imagining an unflappable black woman on the debate stage next to Donald Trump …

Her presidential campaign had fallen into a dangerous pattern: after capturing the country’s attention with moments of prosecutorial brilliance, she had seen excitement about her candidacy soar, only to fall back to Earth …

In Iowa last weekend, the roots of her campaign’s see-saw were clear: It was hard for voters to see Harris the prosecutor. Harris the presidential candidate was meandering and often indirect, struggling to present a strong argument for her own campaign …

With President Donald Trump teetering on the edge of possible impeachment, though, Harris has a clear opportunity. Kamala Harris the prosecutor is already back on Americans’ television screens and could be set for a prime role in a potential Senate impeachment trial.

I’m not so sure. Like the other five senators in the presidential race, Harris has the problem of being more or less a spectator to the drama unfolding in the House, and a prisoner to Republican control of their own chamber. Yes, she is a member of both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, potential venues of hearings related to the impeachment drive and the underlying issues. But she won’t have a chance to grill witnesses as she did during the Comey and Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, unless the Republican chairs of those committees (Richard Burr and Lindsey Graham, respectively) choose to give her and other Democrats that opportunity. In theory, Mitch McConnell could create some sort of special committee to handle ancillary investigations — of the sort that, during the early stages of the Watergate scandal, made the Foghorn Leghorn soundalike Sam Ervin and even the racist demagogue Herman Talmadge national icons. But why would he want to do that when the GOP’s party line is that there is absolutely nothing worth investigating in Trump’s conduct?

As for the impeachment trial (assuming there is one), the one thing we know for sure is that Mitch McConnell will make it just extensive enough to claim that Trump is exonerated at the end of its forgone conclusion in acquittal, and not a moment longer or deeper. And traditionally, senators have been quiet in anticipation of and during impeachment trials, in accord with the criminal-law analogy of them as “jurors” weighing evidence for the impeachment “indictment,” as I explained recently:

According to precedent, senators act like jurors, making no public statements on the proceeding until after their votes are cast (in the Clinton case, senators spoke before the vote in a closed-door session, with their remarks published in the Congressional Record after the vote).

Not a lot of headline-grabbing drama in that procedure.

While I am dubious of the idea that Harris will definitely have a “prime role” in an impeachment trial or related Senate proceedings, Hensley-Clancy is spot-on in observing that the Californian really needs a boost and probably a change in the topics she is addressing on the stump. Harris’s original campaign strategy, based explicitly on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, was to establish herself as a nationally credible candidate before or during the Iowa caucuses, and then win a breakthrough victory in South Carolina by taking away African-American support from Biden just as Obama did from Hillary Clinton. Indeed, she had an advantage even Obama didn’t enjoy, thanks to her home state holding its own primary just a few days after South Carolina, as I observed soon after she entered the race:

In the sports language often used (along with combat and gambling lingo) by political operatives, one of Harris’s people called this strategy: “the SEC primary meets the West Coast offense.” And it makes sense, on paper, particularly if Harris can go into South Carolina with a head of steam and win there.

In fact, after she boxed Joe Biden’s ears in the first candidate debate in June, it looked like Harris was emerging as a world-beater whose stock would rise in every state. But her subsequent downward drift in polling, which continued throughout the summer and into the fall, has led to a strategic reassessment by her campaign. Long story short, she’s been doing so poorly in South Carolina that she’s pouring most of her resources into Iowa to execute the sort of jiujitsu that salvaged John Kerry’s once-doomed candidacy in 2004 (Kerry was badly trailing Howard Dean in New Hampshire, so he went for broke in Iowa and won there in an upset that revived his standing in the Granite State and elsewhere). So far, it’s not working any wonders just yet: in Ann Selzer’s recent gold-standard Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, Harris was running a poor fifth with 6 percent of the vote. Trouble is, the four candidates above her in Iowa are emphasizing the first-in-the-nation caucuses, too, and unlike, say, Elizabeth Warren, Harris is not exactly setting Iowa on fire with her many personal appearances there, as Hensley-Clancy and others have reported.

And meanwhile, the news from later states on the calendar keeps getting worse for Harris. A new CNN poll of South Carolina has her tied with Tom Steyer for fifth place at a mere 3 percent — a point behind Pete Buttigieg, for whom the Palmetto State is hardly a major target. And the latest poll from California, conducted by the Berkeley IGS for the L.A. Times, has the state’s favorite daughter running fourth in single digits, 21 points behind front-running Warren.

Sure, this could all change again: The combative and compelling Kamala Harris of that first debate could return in subsequent debates, and perhaps she can find a way via impeachment to play the prosecutor again (though that role has its own perils, as Tulsi Gabbard showed in eviscerating Harris’s record as California attorney general in the July debate). What she most needs is a collapse of support for Joe Biden, who stands directly in the way of Harris’s efforts to attract African-American votes and to serve as a fallback candidate for voters worried about Warren and Sanders’s vulnerabilities as symbols of the Democratic Party’s leftward drift. But in any event, Harris will soon run out of time. At this point in 2008, Obama was doing a lot better in Iowa, South Carolina, and nationally. There’s only so long that she can remain a candidate of great, if unrealized, potential."

What happens next? Photo: Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images

Bernie Sanders spent lots of time talking on the phone during his two weeks off the campaign trail post–heart attack earlier this month. There were the uneventful well-wishing calls he and his wife Jane got from his rivals in the 2020 presidential race, and from some political allies. (Harry Reid, for one, visited in person while Sanders was still hospitalized in Las Vegas.) There were some more eventful ones, like the “I’m going to endorse you” call he got from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, routed through his campaign manager Faiz Shakir. And, once it pretty quickly became clear to Sanders’s aides in both Las Vegas and Washington that he would be able to resume campaigning, and that they should map out next steps, there were the reassurance calls.

No one, after all, knew what to expect from the 78-year-old, who had just suffered his first heart attack. At his campaign headquarters in D.C., for example, Sanders’s staff gathered three times to hear formal updates while news trickled out from Nevada, then Vermont. Sanders himself called in once to speak with, and rally, the assembled operatives. They’d just come through a long summer that included some undeniably rough patches, politically speaking, both internally and because of the rise of Elizabeth Warren. The campaign had remained mostly quiet in the early days of Sanders’s hospitalization, holding off for days before confirming late on a Friday that he’d suffered a heart attack. But its few informal public communications were starting to shape a message — the day Sanders was discharged and returned to Vermont, senior adviser Josh Orton tweeted a link to a video of “Willy Wonka’s Grand Entrance” and titled it “NEW footage of Bernie leaving the hospital.” Sanders’s top aides now wanted the full staff in on the plan: Sanders would remain at home, recovering, for two weeks until the next debate, but they were to push ahead as hard as ever. The voters needed reassuring, too.

So while Sanders met with his inner circle back in Burlington and began prepping in his backyard for the debate the same way he always did — a casual back-and-forth, not a formal mock session — his campaign began putting out new formal policy proposals (with Sanders weighing in over the phone). It resumed an Iowa television ad buy that it had temporarily suspended, and it advertised a wave of surrogate campaign events in early-voting states. With uncertainty about Sanders’s health circulating, it announced he would participate in a march “to end corporate greed” in Des Moines next month, and it distributed a video Sanders filmed to thank supporters for their messages. He sat for a pair of TV interviews. His teams in the states pushed the “full steam ahead” message, too: In Nevada, they said they’d now attempted over one million voter contacts and rolled out a slate of new community leader and educator endorsements; in New Hampshire, they announced campaign co-chairs; and in South Carolina, they opened an office in Florence County.

And they announced that on Saturday he’d be holding a major rally at Queensbridge Park, titled “Bernie’s Back.” Before long, they started teasing that there’d be a “special guest” there as well.

Still, some nerves lingered in Burlington as the senior brass prepared for Tuesday’s debate in Ohio. They knew Sanders would get a health question, but even if he was ready for that, this three-hour session would still be his return to the full-speed fray.

Yet by the time the candidate walked offstage and asked his aides how he did on Tuesday night, as he always does immediately after leaving debate stages, their mood had shifted considerably. Not only did Sanders exceed his skeptics’ expectations, the public now knew about the endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow “Squad” member Ilhan Omar. (These endorsements were supposed to be rolled out later, but the news broke early.) The campaign’s attention was already shifting to Saturday, when Ocasio-Cortez would join Sanders onstage for the first time this year, a moment that had been in the making since she’d flown to Vermont late last month and sat with Bernie, Jane Sanders, Shakir, and one of her own aides for what Shakir called a meeting of “two ideological compatriots who see each other, who understand one another.”

Sanders’s advisers describe this moment now as a triumphant return to the trail just in time for the campaign to get serious. “November is exactly when we want to be going up, showing momentum,” said Shakir, describing Ocasio-Cortez’s presence onstage as “the kind of movement that shakes” the hard-to-mobilize voters Sanders needs by his side. The senator’s team is in talks with the congresswoman’s about a trip to Iowa, too, Shakir said. Longtime Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said he expects the candidate to soon return to something like his typical breakneck campaign speed: “Obviously the health incident raised some immediate questions, and it was obviously important to demonstrate what was the case — which was he was on the road to recovery and will be campaigning vigorously.” The political revolution, in this telling, is back on track.

The truth is that this is, indeed, an inflection point for Sanders, but a far more delicate one than he or his allies readily admit. In fact, how the candidate handles the next month could determine the rest of his trajectory in the race.

Sanders, who has yet to release promised medical information, and who has switched his primary campaign message from Medicare for All to electability and back multiple times, is reemerging just as more voters are watching the race more closely than ever, and just as Warren, the newly minted front-runner, faces centrist fire for the first time, and just as his campaign brain trust hopes his 2016 supporters come home to him.

Notorious among his allies for his resistance to talk about his personal life, Sanders is hoping to move on from the health question. At earlier stages of his political career, he’s bristled when asked about his health.

It was never a campaign issue in 2016, after Hillary Clinton ally David Brock floated the idea of calling for Sanders to release his medical records early in the primary, only to face a huge internal backlash. Still, Sanders liked making a point of taking it off the table. During that campaign, some of his early ads included shots of him running during his student days and playing baseball as an adult, and he enjoyed playing basketball in front of the cameras. In the lead-up to the 2020 race, he participated in multiple long marches — once, when a CNN anchor asked Weaver about Sanders’s health following such a campaign event in Indiana, Weaver shot back that the reporter was struggling to keep up with the hearty Sanders. Sanders told New York that week, “I thank God, you know, I can’t remember the last day — honestly — when I missed work.” He continued, “What people have a right to know: Is the candidate healthy? Does he or she have the energy to do what is a very stressful and difficult job?” On the debate stage this week, he pointed to his Saturday rally when asked about his heart.

Now, though, he’s tasked with moving past these questions just when he has to catch back up to Warren and eclipse Joe Biden. He lost ground over the summer, and entering the fall, he tossed out and rebuilt parts of his Iowa team and completely overhauled his operation in New Hampshire, a must-win state for him where he is now polling third.

And while polling since his heart attack has been scant, the early indications haven’t been good: The most recent national Quinnipiac poll showed Sanders’s support dropping over the course of the previous week, including significant drops among non-college-educated white voters and very liberal voters — two groups he can ill afford to lose. Meanwhile, a HuffPost/YouGov survey had just 28 percent of Democrats assessing Sanders as being in adequate physical condition for four years of the presidency.

The imperative for a blockbuster return to the scene, then, is strategically obvious. It started with the debate, continued with the rollout of Omar’s endorsement video the next morning, and will peak with Saturday’s rally with Ocasio-Cortez, one of the party’s biggest stars. Soon Sanders will appear with Rashida Tlaib, another “Squad” member, in Michigan, ahead of another expected endorsement.

The question, really, is what comes after that, once he returns to typical campaign events.

Some of Sanders’s close aides were delighted when the senator’s first comments after his hospitalization were about the need to implement a Medicare for All system, and they expect him to lean back into that signature plan as the centerpiece of his campaign. “We will ratchet it up on Medicare for All,” said longtime labor leader Larry Cohen, a veteran Sanders adviser who chairs the board of the Sanders-spawned Our Revolution outside group. Others see merit in a punchy tack that directly takes on Biden, specifically over the health-care question. Already, on Thursday, Sanders issued a statement decrying Biden’s use of “the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All,” and a Friday fundraising email from the campaign echoed this line.

What they all agree on now is that Sanders is intent on digging back in for the long haul, not transitioning to a new kind of campaign, as he’d hinted, then walked back, in recent weeks. The Saturday rally isn’t just about reenergizing his base and bringing in new voters, said Cohen. It’s also a signal of a long slog ahead. That’s because in his telling, it’s a statement of intent about the New York primary.

That contest is likely to be the final opportunity for candidates who are still standing to pick up large numbers of delegates. And it’s not for another six months."

“In general, re-arraignment indicates a change of plea,” said Marcia Murphy, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney in Maryland. She declined to comment further on whether Hasson would plead guilty Thursday. No plea is final until it is entered in court and approved by a judge.

Liz Oyer, one of the federal public defenders representing Hasson, did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Hasson is being held without bond.

Investigators said they found extensive evidence that Hasson had studied and admired the writings of terrorist Anders Breivik, who shot and killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, and who believed that targeted violence was necessary to stop problems caused by immigration. Breivik also advocated six weeks of steroid use before an attack, prosecutors said.

AD

Breivik called for targeting political and media leaders, and investigators with the FBI and the Coast Guard Investigative Service found a spreadsheet on Hasson’s computer that listed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and television personalities such as Joe Scarborough, Don Lemon and Chris Hayes. The investigators found that Hasson had searched for Scarborough’s home address and in January had Googled “best place in dc to see congress people” and “civil war if trump impeached.”

Hasson, who worked in the Coast Guard headquarters in Washington as an acquisitions officer, also apparently wrote a letter to a known American neo-Nazi, according to a prosecution detention motion, which said: “I am a longtime White Nationalist. … I fully support the idea of a White Homeland. … you can make change with a little focused violence.”

Hasson was not charged with any terrorism-related counts. Instead, he was indicted on two counts of unlawful possession of silencers, and two counts of possession of a controlled substance. Motions to dismiss those counts, filed by the federal public defender in Maryland, were denied last month by Hazel, and trial was set for later this month.

But it was still one punctured by tensions and gaffes like Cuomo’s — namely, on questions of gender identity, as transgender activists of color interrupted the candidates to charge that the event had shut out their voices.

Harris’s line as she stepped onstage drew both praise and accusations of pandering, as she does not usually mention her pronouns at debates or campaign events.

That’s perhaps another sign of how LGBTQ issues have entered the mainstream this election cycle in an unprecedented fashion. At the town hall in Los Angeles, attendees in the audience asked nine Democratic candidates questions about HIV and AIDS, mental health care for LGBTQ youth and religious opposition to same-sex marriage.

AD

“For generations, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender Americans have had to live and love in the shadows. We could be arrested, we could be imprisoned, locked up in institutions,” said CNN host Anderson Cooper, an openly gay man, as he introduced the town hall. “The fight for equality is certainly not over.”

Before the audience, all nine candidates promised they would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and would reverse President Trump’s ban on transgender people openly serving in the military.

For one candidate, the night was personal. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came out as gay after serving in Afghanistan, spoke of grappling with his identity as a “civil war.” Asked about the ban on blood donations from men who have sex with men, he said, “My blood’s not welcome in this country. … It’s not based on science; it’s based on prejudice.”

AD

Buttigieg, along with Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), built up to the town hall by releasing their respective agendas on LGBTQ issues. A fourth candidate, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, had published his plans to strengthen rights for gay and transgender people in June.

The evening was also marked by a number of protests from transgender activists in the audience, who interrupted the candidates several times to point to the climbing number of murdered black trans women as well as what they said was a lack of space for their perspectives during the town hall.

But on a mid-September morning in 1997, Warren, by then a celebrated professor at Harvard Law School, returned to memorialize a man who had played a small but not insignificant role in her teaching career.

The five years Warren spent in this sprawling Texas city were among the most transformative of her life. She split with a husband who struggled with her ambition. She started dabbling in the research that would establish her as one of the nation’s foremost experts on consumer bankruptcy law. And she found her voice, developing the speaking style that has made the senator from Massachusetts a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Houston is where Liz Warren became Elizabeth Warren.

Now she had been asked to eulogize longtime UH law professor Eugene Smith, who, as head of the faculty hiring committee in 1978, had been an early Warren champion, urging colleagues to look past her limited teaching experience and what some perceived as her second-rate Rutgers Law School degree.

Smith, who died of complications from the polio he contracted as a child, had specifically requested that Warren speak at his funeral. But what she said inside a small campus chapel stunned her former colleagues.

With a smile on her face and humor in her voice, Warren described how Smith had invited her to his office one day just a few months after she had been hired. He shut the door and lunged for her, she said, and as she protested, he chased her around his desk before she was able to escape out the door.

“Everyone was slack-jawed,” recalled John Mixon, a retired UH professor who had been close friends with Smith and Warren. Among those listening: Smith’s ex-wife and his three adult sons.

In the pews, people exchanged glances. Some at UH disliked Smith — he’d kept a bottle of Scotch in his desk and often told dirty jokes, one colleague remembered later — but “Mean Gene,” as he was known, was generally regarded as harmless. Diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, Smith walked hunched over, his arms increasingly useless as he aged. Some wondered whether it was physically possible for Smith to have done what Warren described.

“To have this image of him chasing her around the desk, it was just comical, and she told the story without rancor,” Mixon recalled.

Her account wasn’t entirely new to him. While Warren had not shared all the specifics, she had gone to Mixon looking for help when she said Smith came on to her that day in early 1979.

Four decades later, Mixon recalls with mixed feelings what he told her: Say nothing. “My advice was that she was brand new in the business,” Mixon said. “He was an established old-guard professor with a lot of power. And if she tried to get him, she would be the one in the long term to suffer because she would become known as a troublemaker.”

Warren nodded, and as he advised, she said nothing. Not when Smith continued to flirt with her. Not when he commented on her appearance. Not when she packed up her office in the spring of 1983 to move on to bigger and more renowned schools.

Warren said nothing until she returned to UH to eulogize a man who had been both a promoter and tormentor, a man who, as she put it in an interview, “no longer had any power over me.”

At Smith’s funeral, Warren told the story in an entertaining way. Two decades later, she would recount it again in a 2017 interview on “Meet the Press,” presenting it as her own sobering #MeToo experience with sexual harassment.

By then, the times had changed, and so had she.

‘Testing her’

The University of Houston Law Center was in a period of transition when Warren interviewed there in 1978.

At the time, the law school had just one full-time tenured female professor, but the number of female students was soaring. The faculty was trying to inject the place with new blood — younger, fresher faces.

Warren was almost 29, and she knew the campus. A decade earlier, she had dropped out of college to marry her high school sweetheart, Jim Warren. She followed him to Houston, where he had been hired to work as a computer engineer for IBM. She took undergraduate classes at UH — tuition was just $50 a semester — until they moved to New Jersey.

Warren earned her law degree from Rutgers just before giving birth to her second child. She got her foot in the door at UH by offering to teach legal writing, classes viewed by most law professors as grunt work.

Gene Smith, who had talked to Warren by phone, met her at the airport, picking her up in his white 1966 Lincoln Continental. His post-polio syndrome was getting worse, and the damaged muscles in his arms were making it harder to drive, but Smith stubbornly refused to give up the car.

He took her out to dinner with a few others on the hiring committee. They went to his favorite restaurant, a steakhouse called The Stables.

In a story that quickly made the rounds among the faculty ― and that Warren later retold at his funeral — Smith ordered a steak, even though his arms were so weak he had trouble cutting it into smaller pieces. The waitress usually helped, but this time, when the steak arrived, Smith pushed the plate over to Warren and ordered her to cut it up for him.

“I guess it was his way of testing her to see how easily she would be manipulated,” Mixon recalled.

Warren just stared at Smith.

“Can’t you tell I’m crippled?” Smith told her.

“I thought you knew that when you ordered the steak,” she coolly replied.

Everyone at the table laughed, including Smith, who advocated for Warren to be hired.

Sitting at that table full of men who smiled as Smith pushed the steak her way, she knew what she would have to endure to teach. “I knew it from the first minute,” Warren said.

She also knew that as a woman who had graduated from a lower-tier law school, with limited teaching experience and two young children at home, she was not a top prospect.

“I had no other options,” she said.

As Warren had anticipated, some questioned her academic background. “Rutgers isn’t a top law school, and for your first job, it really matters where you went to law school,” said Richard Alderman, a UH professor emeritus who was on the hiring committee that year. “But when you met her, she had this personality, this energy. … You knew, just by talking to her, she was going to be successful.”

Warren was hired as an assistant professor, a full-time tenure-track position that included not only legal writing courses but also contracts and commercial law. Warren said she could not remember whether her status as a wife and mother came up in her interviews for the job, but she specifically requested to teach complex financial courses because she thought it might help her be taken more seriously by her colleagues. “I figured if I could manage this, no one would question whether a young woman with two little children belonged,” she said.

According to personnel records released by the Warren campaign, her pay that first year was $20,500 — not much more than the $8,000 a semester she had been paid to teach legal writing one night a week at Rutgers. Strangely, the UH faculty candidate profile also asked for her height and weight: 5-foot-7 and 115 pounds.

With her chin-length pageboy, similar to the hairstyle she wears now, she looked younger than 29.

“I was constantly reminded that I didn’t look like a real law professor,” Warren said.

Her colleagues frequently mistook her that first year for a secretary, the school nurse or even a lost student when they saw a woman wandering through the faculty office suites.

If Warren saw herself as a trailblazer for women in law, she has never acknowledged it. Her mother had long warned her, she has said, about becoming “one of those crazy women’s-libbers.” And according to those who knew her at the time, Warren, then a Republican, did not espouse feminist beliefs.

But in an interview, Warren recalled being acutely aware of her status as one of the only women on the staff.

“The faculty members themselves, often the men, treated me as if I were a second-class citizen,” she said. “It was a lonely experience.”

‘Warren in the making’

For UH law students, Warren was one of their first instructors, teaching contracts, a fundamental course that tends to determine whether a student has a mind for the law.

She was a practitioner of the Socratic method, cold-calling on students and asking them to discuss the particulars of a case or a legal opinion. She believed it forced students to pay attention, encouraging them to think, engage and analyze ideas.

Warren taught in a large lecture hall that resembled an amphitheater. She had about 60 students in her contracts class. And Warren knew by looking at their faces that she wasn’t connecting with them in the way she wanted.

“She came in thinking that students were at a higher level of preparation than they were, and she would teach as if they automatically read the cases and knew what she was talking about,” Mixon said.

Mixon had won multiple teaching awards, and Warren went to him for advice.

Three days a week, after Warren’s contracts class, they would go to lunch at a nearby Mexican restaurant. Over chips and guacamole, she told him about exchanges with students in which she felt she had struggled, and Mixon would analyze and offer help.

He suggested she try to read her class better and present ideas in a more approachable way — not to dumb it down but to use scenarios that would encourage someone who did not yet have the expertise to grasp and engage.

Some people, especially those cowering in the back, “were scared sh--less of her,” recalled Tracey Conwell, a Houston litigation attorney who took contracts and several other classes with Warren.

She knew all their names and had no obvious method for how she called on them.

At one point in the semester, Conwell recalled, a group of her classmates drew up bingo cards with students’ names as they sought to game out Warren’s strategy. “They tried to see if they could guess who would be called on to speak that day,” she said.

One day, Conwell remembered, she and Warren sparred over the philosophical meaning of the word “intent” in contract law, and Warren abruptly cut her off. Conwell was so mad she went to the dean to complain. But the next class, Warren gave Conwell a book: “The Death of Contract,” a controversial 1974 publication that questioned the basis of modern contract law. After that, she said, she and Warren “were buddies.”

“It made clear to me that she was an obviously insightful thinker who had read more than the standard books to arrive at her own concepts about how the law works,” Conwell said. “She didn’t accept things at face value. She did her own looking to understand how we got to this system we had. … And that approach, I think, helped her take this really complicated and dreadfully boring stuff and make it really interesting.”

Michael Olivas, a longtime UH law professor who was hired after Warren, recalled sitting in on her classes and being stunned by how good she was. “She was not Elizabeth Warren yet, but she was Elizabeth Warren in the making,” Olivas said.

Many of her students recognize the same techniques and speaking style at work on the campaign trail. Even her raised arms are familiar.

“It just feels the same when you see her on television and she’s trying to explain something and she says, ‘Look, it’s like this,’ or she gets very animated and says, ‘Here’s the thing,’ ” said Rita Lucido, a Houston family-law attorney who took classes with Warren. “I don’t look back and think of contracts as this dry subject, because she made such an effort to keep us engaged with her and to make sure it made sense to us not only from a legal perspective but a real-world perspective.”

Warren was younger and less stuffy than the men on the faculty. She painted a wall in her office a bright green and hung a large wicker porch swing, inherited from her grandmother, where she would sit and prepare for classes and talk to anyone who came by.

Warren also seemed human. Dona Bolding, who was in Warren’s 1979 contracts class, recounted the time she was shopping at Loehmann’s, the discount department store known for its marked-down designer clothing, and ran into Warren standing in her underwear in the store’s communal dressing room.

Bolding said she was “mortified.” But Warren instantly made light of the situation. “Oh Miss Bolding,” Warren called out. “I see you love a bargain! ”

‘The breaking point’

Warren loved her job. To keep it, she realized she would have to maintain a good relationship with Smith, while also deflecting what she described as increasingly inappropriate behavior from him.

He regularly sat in on her classes, evaluating her talent as a professor. He wrote memos to the law school dean and others as part of the process to determine whether she would be promoted from associate professor to tenured faculty member. He was, in many ways, the gatekeeper to her future.

But, according to Warren, he was also increasingly a harasser: He commented on her clothes and appearance in ways that made her feel uncomfortable. He told dirty jokes and invited her out for drinks, which she declined. She had to get home to her family, she reminded him, hoping he would get the hint.

Warren thought she was managing him until that day in early 1979 when she said he lunged for her in his office.

I wasn’t afraid of him physically so much as I was afraid of what I knew he could take away from me. Elizabeth Warren, on Gene Smith

She considered punching him in the face, she said in an interview. But she thought of his evaluations, his sway with the dean and how the school still had not decided whether her contract would be renewed.

“If Gene wanted to sink me, he could,” she said. “If he had said, ‘She’s not very good. Let’s push her out the door,’ I would have been gone. And so, when he chased me around his office, I wasn’t afraid of him physically so much as I was afraid of what I knew he could take away from me.”

Warren already instinctively knew silence was her only real option, even before Mixon told her. “That kind of thing was in the air,” she said. “Keep your head down and move on. And that’s what I did.”

As Warren was trying to hang on to her job at UH that first year, her life at home was falling apart. She was trying to balance the pressures of being a new professor, under intense scrutiny, with being a wife and mother. And she was failing.

“My world was stretched to the breaking point,” she said.

She would cook breakfast for Jim and her two kids, Alex and Amelia, and then head to school, where she was balancing classes, research and everything else. She would get home around 5, sometimes get dinner on the table around 7 or 8 and stay up past midnight, preparing for classes the next day. And then she would do it all over again.

“Child care nearly brought me down,” Warren often says, until her mother’s sister, Bess Reed Veneck, came to Houston from Oklahoma to help out with the kids.

But Aunt Bee, as the senator calls her, couldn’t fix what was wrong with Warren’s marriage. By Warren’s telling, she and Jim never really fought. He just gave her looks — when dinner was late or when she was up all night grading exams.

When they were on their high school debate team together, Jim had been drawn to her because she was smart and driven, Warren remembered. Now he seemed to yearn for a more traditional wife. But she had become a different person than she was at 19, when they married.

“I think we were both shocked by who I turned out to be 10 years later,” Warren said. “He thought I would be someone else, and truthfully, I kind of assumed that, too. I kept changing and growing almost despite myself.”

Teaching law, Warren said, “was when the whole world opened up for me.” It was impossible to put her ambitions back into a box and close it away, not even to save her marriage. “I wanted so much to do the work,” she said. “I wanted to do the work, I wanted to be a good mom, I wanted to be a good wife but didn’t manage all of that.”

I think we were both shocked by who I turned out to be 10 years later. ... I kept changing and growing almost despite myself. Elizabeth Warren

One night, Warren recounted in her memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” she asked Jim whether he wanted a divorce. She was shocked she said it. But he didn’t appear to be. “Yes,” he replied.

Jim moved out and into an apartment in southwest Houston, according to public records. She and the kids stayed in the family’s suburban home. The couple separated sometime in early 1979. Warren has never said exactly when, though she later wrote in her memoir that “there were reconsiderations and some attempts at one-more-try-to-make-it-work.”

Her family watched the kids that summer as Warren traveled to Florida to attend a conservative law and economics retreat. One of the other attendees was Bruce Mann, a professor and legal historian at the University of Connecticut.

Both have described a moment of instant attraction. It’s unclear when the two officially became a couple, but Warren has said she visited him that fall in Connecticut. And he came to see her in Houston.

Warren filed for divorce from Jim on Nov. 5, 1979. The divorce was finalized on Jan. 16, 1980. Jim agreed to pay child support that increased by 5 percent a year, as well as contributing to their kids’ college educations, an unusual detail even now, according to Susan Myres, a former Warren student at UH who is now a top divorce attorney in Houston. The agreement, Myres said, reads as if it was written by “a future consumer advocate in the making.”

While Warren has been careful to call her ex-husband “a good man,” she has occasionally hinted at bitterness. After their divorce, Jim quit smoking, took dance lessons and got remarried, she wrote in her memoir.

“We didn’t see him much,” she said. He died of lung cancer in 2003 at 58.

While Jim had struggled with Warren’s ambition, Mann embraced it. The two were married in July 1980, shortly after Warren’s 31st birthday, and Mann gave up his tenure-track job and moved to Houston, where UH gave him a one-year teaching contract. Warren was awarded tenure and named assistant dean of the law center. But by 1983, she was packing up her office and taking down her porch swing. Warren, her second husband and her two children were heading to the University of Texas Law School in Austin, leaving Houston behind.

‘A homecoming’

On a hot summer day this past July, Warren walked back through the hallways of UH, the place where it all began for her. She pointed out her old office, the classrooms where she taught.

“This is a homecoming for me,” she later told a crowd of more than 2,000 people who had lined up for hours to hear her speak. This was where she had gotten her first real job. “Full time, tenure track,” she said. “It still sounds so good to say it.”

Forty-one years earlier, she had turned heads for looking so out of place. But this time, people knew her instantly. They ran up to shake her hand. She was Elizabeth Warren, the woman running for president.

In one respect, it was a nothingburger of a story: California’s senior senator Dianne Feinstein formally endorsed the presidential candidate she has been informally backing all along, Joe Biden. Indeed, as the San Francisco Chronicle noted in first reporting the development, Feinstein hosted a fundraiser for Uncle Joe in her home just last week.

But the lack of any particular reason to draw attention to the Californian’s support for her old friend has to make you wonder why it was necessary to produce one. Having stepped right up to the fail-safe line and signaled her ultimate intentions, Feinstein would normally have refrained from a formal endorsement that severely disrespected her junior Golden State colleague, Kamala Harris, not to mention the other four U.S. senators currently in the race, as the Los Angeles Times observed:

Feinstein’s endorsement stands out not just for the home-state slight, but that she has picked sides at all. With five current senators still in the race, many of their colleagues have declined to endorse at all, citing wariness of choosing favorites among their political friends.

Indeed, of the Democratic senators endorsing a candidate so far, the only ones who are not from that candidate’s home state are Bob Casey, from Biden’s native state of Pennsylvania; Doug Jones of Alabama, who desperately needs to identify himself with the moderate wing of his party; and now Feinstein. Maybe it was just a coincidence that Feinstein made her move soon after Warren moved ahead of Biden in two highly influential California primary polls (from PPIC and LAT/Berkeley), even as she also pulled ahead of the former veep in RealClearPolitics’ national polling averages. But probably not. We may see more big Biden endorsements, if my hunch is right and Biden is calling in all his chits to maintain his position as at least a co-front-runner in the 2020 race. Too bad for him that the endorsement that could do him the most good, from Barack Obama, will probably never come, unless and until Biden wins the nomination on his own."

These identical claims got our interest.

Sanders and Warren have raised most of their campaign money this year from small-dollar donations. Yet both also have tapped millions of dollars left over from previous campaigns — from a time when they had not yet adopted the strict fundraising practices they currently follow. That complicates their claim to “100 percent” grass-roots purity.

AD

It’s a good example of how the complexities of the campaign finance system sometimes get blurred in the service of an appealing talking point. Let’s dig in.

The Facts

Sanders had raised $46.3 million by the end of the second quarter, according to Federal Election Commission records. That includes $10.1 million transferred from previous campaigns.

AD

When not counting transfers, 77 percent of Sanders’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. That’s the highest share of small-dollar donations relative to total fundraising among all major candidates. When counting transfers, the share of small-dollar donations is 60 percent.

Warren had raised $35.6 million by the end of the second quarter, FEC records show. That includes $10.4 million transferred from her 2018 Senate campaign.

When not counting transfers, 67 percent of Warren’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. When counting transfers, the proportion is 48 percent.

AD

“Grass-roots funding” has no formal definition. Sanders and Warren seem to define it in terms of the money they won’t accept.

AD

Sanders doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from corporate PACs or super PACs, or from fossil fuel, drug or insurance companies. Warren doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from federal lobbyists or PACs, or fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.

Considering these restrictions, it’s plausible to describe all the money Sanders and Warren have raised directly this year as grass-roots funding.

But there’s another piece of the pie here. As noted, Sanders and Warren each have transferred nearly $10 million from previous campaigns to their 2020 presidential committees.

AD

AD

In Sanders’s case, FEC records show he had transferred $4.6 million from his 2016 to 2020 presidential campaign committee as of the end of the second quarter.

In his previous presidential campaign, Sanders had somewhat looser fundraising restrictions in place. News reports show he held at least a few events in 2015 where he sought high-dollar donations.

Time magazine reported in December 2015: “Sanders has hosted at least nine medium- to high-dollar, closed-door fundraisers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere to directly fund his own presidential campaign. Even though Sanders’ efforts sometimes have a proletarian flair — he held one $200-per-ticket fundraiser at a dive bar near a grungy Seattle park — some aspects of the Democratic insurgent’s fundraising are similar to the candidates he condemns.”

The New York Times reported in October 2015: “Mr. Sanders was cheered at a fancy campaign fund-raiser at the Hollywood home of Syd Leibovitch, a high-end real estate agent, and his wife, Linda, on Wednesday night. Tickets for the event sold for a minimum of $250. Those who spent the maximum, $2,700, or who raised $10,000, were invited to a ‘pre-event reception,’ according to the invitation.”

Sanders spokeswoman Sarah Ford said: “In 2016, we held zero closed-door fundraisers with high-dollar donors and accepted no donations from corporate PACs, corporate lobbyists or super PACs.”

When we asked about the high-dollar fundraising in 2015, though, a Sanders aide said, “We do not plan to transfer the amount of money from the 2016 account that came from fundraisers with high-dollar donors in attendance.”

AD

AD

The Sanders aide added that, for the 2020 campaign, grass-roots fundraisers “run alongside the senator’s schedule at public venues and are live-streamed on social media.” The aide added: “They are open to the public and tickets start at $27.”

In Warren’s case, FEC records show she jump-started her presidential campaign this year with a $10.4 million transfer from her 2018 Senate committee. The infusion allowed her to build a campaign apparatus early in the race.

For her 2018 Senate reelection campaign, Warren raised money at events with high-dollar donors. A search of her FEC records showed max contributions of $5,400 from the chief executives of DreamWorks and Yelp, media mogul Haim Saban, philanthropist Alexander Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge fund owners and wealthy investors, and some donors who have given millions to the Democratic Party. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren’s Senate campaign. (The contribution limit for individuals is $2,700 per race, but they can give that amount for both a primary and general election.)

AD

AD

Warren also benefited from some PAC donations when she ran for Senate, though it was a small share of her fundraising, as we explained in this fact check.

Warren raised $6 million in donations of $1,000 or more to her 2018 Senate campaign, a spokesman said. That’s about 23 percent of her total $25.8 million fundraising for that race. According to OpenSecrets, Sanders raised nearly $28 million in donations of $1,000 or more to his 2016 presidential campaign, a little more than 10 percent of his total $232 million haul for that race.

“The open secret of Ms. Warren’s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency,” the Times reported this month, noting “trips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha’s Vineyard, and Philadelphia — all with fundraisers on the agenda.”

AD

AD

The Warren campaign in response to our questions said the average contribution to her Senate campaign in 2018 was $29.45, a sign of broad appeal among grass-roots donors.

Warren also “raised or donated $11 million to Democrats running for office and state parties in all 50 states,” a spokesman said.

“Elizabeth’s schedule is filled with town halls and selfie lines, not closed-door fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires, because she believes that to take back the White House we need to build a grassroots movement,” Warren spokesman Chris Hayden wrote in an email. “When we made the decision to run the campaign this way, the players in the usual money-for-influence game dismissed it as naive and said it would never work and it would kill the campaign. We're pleased that our grassroots strategy has been so effective that they're now threatened enough to be attacking us for it.”

AD

The Pinocchio Test

Sanders and Warren say they’re running presidential campaigns funded “100%” by grass-roots donors. It’s a big claim with no wiggle room.

Money is fungible, so it’s an artifice to claim that money from wealthy donors last time around isn’t being used this time around.

The key here is that Sanders and Warren define their presidential campaigns as entirely grass-roots-funded because of their self-imposed restrictions: no hobnobbing with rich donors in closed events and no PAC money, for example.

But Warren held high-dollar fundraisers for her 2018 Senate run and then transferred $10.4 million from that campaign account to her presidential committee. Her Senate run raised $6 million from donors who gave $1,000 or more, and she also took some PAC contributions.

Sanders in 2015 sought and received big checks from wealthy donors. Sanders’s 2020 committee so far has gotten $4.6 million from his prior presidential campaign.

These are omissions worthy of Two Pinocchios. As a share of total fundraising, however, Sanders was less dependent than Warren on high-dollar contributions in his previous campaign.

That electability and support go hand-in-hand means that as support for a candidate drops, so does the perception that the candidate can win the general election. The correlation between the two, in other words, means electability is often just a trailing indicator of primary support anyway.

For former vice president Joe Biden, this was always a looming iceberg. If voters stopped thinking he was the best candidate to beat Trump next year — which they consistently seemed to think — what would happen to his support? Or, conversely (and probably more accurately): If voters stopped supporting him, what would happen to perceptions of his electability?

AD

AD

We’re starting to get an answer to the second question.

On Monday, Quinnipiac University released a poll showing that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had taken a within-the-margin-of-error lead over Biden in national polling. In August, she trailed by 11 points. Now she leads by three.

Comparing the new results to August is more broadly instructive. At that point, Biden had an 11-point lead in support (shown on the vertical axis below) but a 37-point lead on the electability question (left to right). (Quinnipiac asks which candidate “has the best chance” of beating Trump.)

The lines show movement over time: When Biden stumbled badly against Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) in the first Democratic primary debate, his support and sense of electability fell, too, with Harris seeing quick gains on both points. Those gains for Harris have since evaporated.

AD

AD

Notice the diagonal dashed line. Biden had more support on electability in August (49 percent) than overall (32 percent), so his dot is below the diagonal line. Harris at that point was the first pick of 7 percent of Democrats and seen as the most electable by 6 percent, so she was right on the diagonal.

Here’s the shift that happened in the new poll.

Warren had big gains in electability and support. Harris saw both decline.

The other two lines, though, don’t show a link between the two. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) continued to hold steady on the level of support he sees — but the extent to which he’s seen as electable continues to erode. Biden, meanwhile, has seen his overall support sink — but he has also maintained about the same level of electability.

Overall, Warren’s line looks the way you’d expect based on what we’ve seen in the past: up and to the right, gaining support and a sense of electability at the same time. Biden is hanging in there, though, still viewed as having the best chance against Trump by twice as many respondents in Quinnipiac’s poll.

AD

AD

This is national polling, not state polling, so it’s not particularly predictive. But the implication is that the dominant existing calculus — Biden is most electable and, therefore, has the best shot — isn’t as solid as might have been expected.

But, then, we shouldn’t have expected those two things to be as tightly linked as they’ve been presented. We said this in July and will say it again: Biden’s 2020 may look more like Hillary Clinton’s 2008 than her 2016.

There’s a lot of enthusiasm surrounding Democratic presidential politics at the moment. When Bernie Sanders bashes billionaires or Elizabeth Warren goes after big corporations, most people within earshot get to feeling like populists. Harris’ campaign is very good at organizing demonstrations of support on behalf of “Kamala for the People.” Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke have shown signs of developing a bit of a cult of personality among excited followers. Joe Biden’s adept at getting into the swing of things at African-American churches, and could probably turn a Knights of Columbus Bingo Night into something special.

But for a distinctly wild and entirely spontaneous political crowd, it’s hard to beat Andrew Yang and his Gang, as they showed early this week in the City of the Angels. The Los Angeles Times had the story:

The underdog Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang walked onstage at MacArthur Park on Monday night with the swagger of a competitor who’s already won, complete with a pyrotechnic display and the 1990s R&B classic “Return of the Mack” playing on the speaker system….

Yang’s showmanship, humorously math-based approach to solving America’s problems and his love of f-bombs have won him a diverse and ear-splitting following that was on full display at his Los Angeles rally.

Members of the “Yang Gang” and the Yang-curious packed the lawn in front of the amphitheater where the candidate spoke, many hoisting signs with single words on them that anywhere else wouldn’t seem to go together: Some just said “Math.” Others said “Humanity.”

The atmosphere was not, shall we say, that of an old-school political rally featuring corny patriotic songs or venerable protests songs–or the refashioned Top 40 music that boomer pols from Bill Clinton (“Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow”) to Donald Trump (“You Can’t Always Get What You Want”) always favored:

This wasn’t a typical campaign rally. It was more like a revival set to hip-hop, with one-liners that much of the crowd knew by heart.

Any time Yang said the word “math,” the crowd chanted “Math!” “Math!” “Math!” as part of the nerdy-cool theater of his campaign events. Several people brought signs featuring a thousand-dollar bill with Yang’s face on it.

That would be an allusion to Yang’s signature policy initiative, a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month designed to offset mass unemployment caused by intensified automation. But increasingly the 44-year-old entrepreneur’s untraditional style is getting as much attention as his substance:

“He represents something that’s beyond politics,” said Lee-kai Wong, 34, a genetics lab worker at UCLA. “The way he talks about the country — it’s a message of healing. I think we need a little more mercy and forgiveness.”

Yang’s campaign is still in the single digits in polling, but his support and the donations that go along with it have gotten him onto the stage of every Democratic debate so far — beating out political veterans and more traditional candidates.

Tony Moreno, 52, a professional driver from Ontario, said Yang “crosses every color line there is” culturally and politically.

As I can testify upon abundantly hearing from the Yang Gang after writing that he had no plausible path to the nomination, the Gang is very outspoken on social media. They pretty clearly view their candidate as sui generis and the fomenter of a potential political revolution. Plus they believe deeply in his coolness:

The crowd at MacArthur Park kept urging Yang to body-surf over his amassed supporters, but he’s already riding a wave.

He’s raising money and performing in polls well enough, it seems, to stay on the debate stage with the more traditional candidates at least through November, at which point a lot of his rivals may drop out. So keep an eye on Yang and the Gang. However little media coverage they receive, they are pretty good at gaining attention."

Two weeks ago, Bernie Sanders’s 2020 campaign looked seriously unwell — and then, so did Bernie Sanders. As of October 1, the Vermont senator’s support in national polls had been stagnating for months, while his standing in surveys of early states had been declining. For a newcomer to presidential politics, boasting a lock on third place four months before Iowa would be auspicious. But for a candidate who already enjoyed near 100 percent name recognition among the party faithful, it seemed the opposite; especially as Elizabeth Warren moved steadily further ahead of her fellow left-wing New Englander in the polls.

And then the 78-year-old socialist had a heart attack. And in one of his first interviews after the health scare, an understandably fatigued-looking Bernie suggested he would have to “change the nature of the campaign.” A thousand obituaries for “the political revolution” were prewritten.

But Sanders’s showing Tuesday night will keep them unpublished. At the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio — his first major campaign event since taking ill — Bernie wasn’t just his old, bizarrely sharp and energetic-for-a-septuagenarian self. He was better, crisper, and funnier than before. The hoarse voice that plagued Sanders on the last episode of this (wretched) TV show was gone. A new perspective on the fragility of this life — and the preciousness of every opportunity to mitigate the suffering of other human beings — had, presumably, taken its place. Or maybe Bernie just got a good night’s sleep Monday. Either way, he turned in his finest debate performance of the cycle thus far.

In the (apparently, legally mandatory) early back-and-forth on the horrors of replacing private-insurance premiums with payroll taxes, Sanders benefited from the greater clarity of his position relative to Warren’s (he is comfortable copping to the necessity of tax hikes, she prefers to avoid the T-word), and his rivals’ greater interest in damaging the race’s new front-runner.

Later, he delivered a rousing defense of his desire to expropriate Tom Steyer’s wealth; interrupted Joe Biden to crack a joke amusing enough to earn him an impromptu embrace from the former vice-president; and still managed to stick a shiv between Uncle Joe’s ribs when the time was ripe:

Finally, Sanders closed out the night by demonstrating that he isn’t actually incapable of indulging the press’ bottomless appetite for pleasing pablum about bipartisan cooperation, and the evils of divisiveness. Asked to describe a friendship that transcended partisan lines, the senator reminded America of a fact some of his loudest online supporters often elide — Bernie is capable of playing nice with Republican colleagues, and pursuing incremental progress over ideological purity, as he did when partnering with John McCain on reforms to veterans’ health care.

Meanwhile, in the face of heavy incoming fire, Warren’s answers often came off as less crisp and self-assured versions of Sanders’s (which had not, in my infinitely objective view, been the case at previous debates). The Massachusetts senator put up a solid performance. But the combination of Sanders’s vitality, and Warren’s incessant obligation to play defense, made Bernie look like the more effective messenger for the party’s left flank (at least, for this evening).

And then, minutes after the debate was done, the Sanders campaign won the endorsement of the most charismatic congresswoman in the United States: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez revealed that she will be lending Bernie 2020 her considerable star power at a rally in Queens on Saturday. AOC’s fellow “squad” members, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, will also reportedly be joining the political revolution.

Whether any of this will actually matter is unknowable. There isn’t much evidence that any of the previous Democratic debates made a durable impact on the polls. To the extent that Sanders needs to improve his standing with older voters, and Democrats who subscribe to conventional notions about “electability,” AOC’s rubber stamp isn’t going to help. But the senator’s mission Tuesday night was to keep the political obituarists at bay. There’s no question he accomplished that much."

This afternoon, right-wing hucksters Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman held another press conference. Wohl and Burkman frequently and lazily concoct political scandals out of thin air and then fail to back them up. They are regarded, far and wide, as a joke. They tried unsuccessfully to Me Too Robert Mueller. Earlier this month, they leveled allegations that Elizabeth Warren was having an affair with a much younger former Marine. Today, they alleged that Senator Ted Cruz was a swinger.

You should not care about this pair. I need to be very clear on that. They are big ol’ dummies and every blog post about them (including this one) is giving them oxygen.

That being said, their audio-visual setup is wild. I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s so funny. It tickles me. Every time they hold one of these dumb press conferences in Burkman’s driveway, I see this ramshackle AV setup and laugh. It’s baffling. It keeps me up at night. I have an idiot disease and the cause is this collection of furniture and appliances.

Generally, each presser has the same setup, as seen in the tweet above from this past May. All of it has the vibe of when you gave your parents a “Why I Should Be Allowed to Have a Nintendo” presentation in third grade.

At the top of the 12 steps leading up to Burkman’s stoop is a lectern. Below that, at a slight jag in the staircase, is a side table with a flat-screen TV on top of it. There is also a sound system with some heavy-duty speakers connected to a mic at the lectern.

God, all of it makes me laugh. It sends me into a downward spiral whenever I see it. This setup exists in the space between impromptu and rehearsed. The tech set reflects the people they are: amateurs cosplaying as pros. They wear suits to their own press conferences, where they haul a table and a TV out from the living room and plop it on the porch. But they are also so committed to this bit that they have a robust speaker setup for their dozen or so attendees. It’s all incongruous.

Their security guard just wears one AirPod? Who could he possibly be talking to? He’s the only guard.

It’s not like they don’t have money. The alleged victims they pull out of the woodwork to smear others are often paid. A man that the pair recruited to level bogus claims against Kamala Harris said he was hired off of a Craigslist ad seeking “a male actor in their early 20’s to early 30’s for basic performance art acting” and promising $250 an hour, according to the Daily Beast.

Gentleman, you could put that money toward better equipment, maybe an outdoor projection system. You do not have to keep hauling furniture that clearly is from Burkman’s living room out to the driveway. That table has a glass top; if you slip while carrying it down the steps, you could be in real trouble.

It is so funny to me that there’s a lectern. Why is there a lectern? The pair hosts these press conferences with enough frequency that I have to assume they own a lectern. That’s funny to me; keeping a lectern on hand just in case you need to give a press conference about horny politicians. “Jacob, my man, we gotta break out the lectern.”

Oh, another question I just thought of. Why is the TV in front of the podium? That seems like an oversight. They can’t see the TV. How are they going to know what’s on the TV?

I love the optics of it. I am enraptured by the “outdoor community playhouse production” aesthetic. I hate these hucksters, but you gotta hand it to them: They’re working with what they’ve got (which is one full-size lectern, a midsize flat-screen TV, a tasteful side table, two pro-grade speakers, and a couple of semi-functional brains)."

For instance, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., invited listeners to “picture what it’s going to be like” after Trump is gone, then said:

AD

It starts out feeling like a happy thought. This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we’ll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process. I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.

For Buttigieg, it’s largely a matter of “turning the page” on the Trump era. Elsewhere he’s used the metaphor of “changing the channel” away from this “horror show.” After this, Buttigieg promises to heal the country’s divisions while also getting to work on its challenges.

But in spite of his recognition that we face “big issues,” for Buttigieg, this need for healing actually argues for tempering our policy ambitions. Buttigieg basically said just this, noting that we should not attempt Medicare-for-all because after Trump, our country will be “horrifyingly polarized,” and expanding Medicare voluntarily can achieve universal health care without further exacerbating that polarization.

AD

In short: Too much ambition means more division, and we’ve already got as much of that as we can take.

It’s hard to overstate how fundamentally different a reading that is from that offered by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She declared that the only way Democrats can beat Trump is by “addressing head-on” the fact that “the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy,” adding:

AD

People in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. ... Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.

That’s a fairly direct indictment of the caution offered by Buttigieg — and Joe Biden, whose agenda is somewhat more liberal than is commonly acknowledged, but who nonetheless is making his No. 1 mission to “restore” the country’s unity after Trump’s racism tore it apart.

AD

In Warren’s diagnosis, the problem is oligarchic capture of our political economy. It isn’t just that vowing to genuinely take on this capture is necessary to mobilize the grass-roots energy to defeat Trump but also that it threatens to persist as a defining feature of the After Trump era.

Over and over, Warren says shrinking from “big fights” is the wrong thing to be signaling an intention to do — contra Buttigieg, the prospect of deep divisions after Trump calls for more ambitious reform efforts. Thus Warren proposes deep reforms to rid Washington of corruption and to restructure the economy.

AD

If anything, Bernie Sanders went even more decisively in that direction. He argued that the way to end the “hatred” and “division” inflicted on the country by Trump is with …

AD

… an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.

Transforming the country, Sanders noted, means dealing with the stark facts that “87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured,” that “half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck” and that we face “the existential threat of climate change.”

It’s often suggested that the fundamental divide among Democrats is between those who see Trump as merely a passing aberration — after which something resembling normalcy can be restored — and those who see him as a symptom of much more deeply rooted systemic problems with our economy and democracy.

But the divide might be better expressed this way: It’s between those who think the deep ferment of the moment calls for a combination of some sort of unspecified unifying salve and a promise of minimal post-Trump disruption, and those who see it as an opportunity — to jolt Americans into an awareness that things are so badly off track that we need to reach for something much bigger.

Ben: You wrote today that to the extent markets are concerned about the probably-imminent impeachment of President Trump, it’s not so much because of the political crisis aspect of the situation — it’s more that a cornered Trump might enact even more damaging trade and other economic policies than he has already put into place. What would such policies look like, do you think?

Josh: They could look like some of the things we have seen in the past — higher tariffs on Chinese goods, a floated idea to block U.S. investments in Chinese firms, escalation in the trade disputes with the E.U. (including the valid, WTO-certified dispute over subsidies to Airbus), Trump’s periodically threatened tariffs on European cars.

Trump has also periodically threatened to withdraw from NAFTA. He’s been appeased on NAFTA because he negotiated the USMCA, the NAFTA replacement deal that is very similar to NAFTA but “his.” Impeachment makes it less likely the House will pass USMCA, and he could get mad and withdraw from NAFTA, though he pointedly declined to threaten that last week when a Fox Business reporter asked him at the U.N.

There are also periodic bills to keep the government open, which he could veto. Or he could take other actions that would cause disruptions in international markets, such as military escalations in or around the Persian Gulf.

Of course, these are all things he could do anyway. But I think the concern is that impeachment might leave him inflamed, or seeking ways to demonstrate he still has power, or looking for distractions.

The countervailing force is that, under political threat, his greatest asset and one he really needs to retain is a strong economy. That’s likely why he sent some softening signals on China last week and passed on the option to threaten NAFTA withdrawal. But if the economy starts to weaken more anyway (which looks like a distinct possibility) he could decide his advisers were wrong to talk him out of his instincts on trade, and he could take some of these steps in the mistaken belief that he would boost the economy and the markets by taking them. Basically, the idea is that impeachment could push Trump to be more chaotic, and the markets like chaotic Trump much less than they like the Trump who signs corporate tax cuts.

Ben: It seems unlikely to me that any of these actions would help Trump’s reelection prospects, and some of them, like initiating a military attack, would be REALLY unpopular. But I guess the trade war itself isn’t popular, and that hasn’t stopped him. As we’ve noted, it’s one of the few issues that seems core to his DNA.

Josh: It is. And he’s pretty effectively deployed subsidies to blunt the direct, negative effects of the tariffs in places that depend heavily on agriculture. The problem is we’re starting now to see the deeper effects — the tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs, along with unrelated economic weakness that’s emerged in China and Europe, are hurting U.S. manufacturing output. People may or may not view that directly as an effect of the tariffs, but the economic weakness still hurts the president politically.

I should note: The tariffs hurt manufacturing in two ways. One is that other countries impose retaliatory tariffs and it becomes harder for U.S. firms to export their goods. Another is that a lot of manufacturers rely on raw materials, like steel and aluminum, that have gotten more expensive because of the tariffs.

Ben: This is kind of a broad question. I’m trying to imagine a political crisis the likes of which we haven’t seen before — something like Trump being convicted in the Senate and refusing to leave office, as unlikely as that is. Would such a crisis automatically be terrible for the economic picture, or is it something that markets could pretty quickly rebound from? Is mere uncertainty about what’s going on enough to throw things into disarray?

Josh: So let me preface by saying I don’t think that’s likely for a few reasons. One is that, for Trump to be in a position where at least 20 Senate Republicans are going to vote against him, there would have to be major underlying changes, likely including a significant erosion in economic performance that has undermined his popularity and made it possible for Republicans to break with him. And if the Republican Party has fractured enough for him to be convicted, Trump would not be able to meaningfully resist removal from office. He wouldn’t have enough internal support within the party (as demonstrated by 20 votes for removal), let alone enough support from the military and bureaucratic apparatus. So at that point we’re talking about a man ranting and raving on Twitter that he’s still president while Mike Pence runs the country.

So, no, I don’t think that affects the economy at the margin, though again, to have gotten to that place, something bad probably already happened to the economy. To the extent it affects the markets, I think it’s more likely because that level of disarray in the GOP signals the likelihood of a very strong Democratic victory, with enough of a mandate to do things like raise the corporate income tax or strengthen antitrust laws or do other things that equity investors would consider to be negative.

But to take your question more broadly: If we had some sort of constitutional crisis that was likely to lead to civil unrest, yes, obviously, that would be bad for the economic and market picture. You can just look at what’s happening in Hong Kong. The economy isn’t Hong Kong’s biggest problem right now, but it probably is heading into recession.

Ben: From your perspective, does the general market stance toward impeachment make sense?

Josh: Yes. With the caveat that I don’t think the market is that shaken by impeachment, there is no upside in impeachment for stocks, and it is possible to articulate some possible downsides. So yeah, it makes sense that impeachment would be negative for the market, by a little. But I think they’re mostly shaken by other factors.

Ben: Like all the bearish economic indicators that keep mounting?

Josh: Right. Now, of course, you could make a case that rule of law is good for equities in the long run, and impeachment is an assertion of rule of law, so shouldn’t that be good for stocks? But I think the links there are too tenuous, especially the latter one. I don’t think Trump being impeached materially changes the odds that, say, courts will enforce private contracts in the future.

Ben: Yeah, that seems like a stretch. Again, on the off-chance Trump was removed from office, I assume Pence would be a completely acceptable replacement from a Big Business perspective.

Josh: Yes, presumably a better replacement — much less likely to be erratic or to impose a lot of tariffs. But again, see above: other, negative things have to happen for stocks to get to a point where we’re replacing Trump with Pence. And with the GOP chaos that would entail, markets might be expecting Pence now but Warren in a year.

I want to note one aside about Elizabeth Warren, by the way. If she is the nominee, it is in her best interest that the market becomes convinced that she will win and be horrible, and get its tantrum out of the way while she is still a candidate. Then she can say the market is falling because of Trump’s shitty economic management, not markets’ fear of her policies. And then she can come into the transition with all the fears about her already priced into stocks, and if the economy and stocks are then less harmed by her policies than Wall Street fears, that will drive stock prices up.

Ben: I’m envisioning a lot of broker quotes directly tying fear of her presidency to a market decline, though.

Josh: Sure, which gives her another opportunity to attack Wall Street. People don’t feel sympathy for the brokers.

Ben: No, every one of those quotes is like an ad for her. But that might change if people become convinced, rightly or wrongly, that her presidency could lead to economic turmoil.

Josh: It could, but people tend to give the sitting president more credit and more blame for the economy than he deserves, especially with Trump, whose central pitch was that he was a business guy who could make the economy work. It is a tough sell to say economic (or even financial market) problems are being caused by the person who isn’t even president yet."

The Policies

B-SCHOOLS SAY IMMIGRATION CHANGES ARE URGENT: The deans of nearly 50 business schools are calling on President Trump and congressional leaders to quickly overhaul the country’s immigration policy for high-skilled workers.

Why they say it's urgent: The U.S. is losing critical talent from other countries that’s essential to the growth of the American economy as rapid advances in technology restructure the future of work as we know it.

The open letter appears in the Wall Street Journal today and was provided exclusively to Power Up:

What they want: The leaders from the business schools of Yale, Columbia, Stanford, Duke and New York University and others want the Trump administration to remove the limits on visas granted to individual countries, reform the H-1B visa program to increase the chances that top skilled talent gains entry to the U.S., and even create a so-called “heartland visa” to encourage the flow of such skilled workers to parts of the U.S. “that could most use the vitality of these talented individuals.”

They seem to be making an appeal to Trump’s focus on the economy: “A combination of our outdated laws, artificial regional and skills-based caps on immigration, and recent spikes in hostility are closing the door to the high-skilled immigrants our economy needs to thrive,” the deans write.

“A combination of our outdated laws, artificial regional and skills-based caps on immigration, and recent spikes in hostility are closing the door to the high-skilled immigrants our economy needs to thrive,” the deans write. How it impacts business schools: “For the first time since we started keeping track of these data, the past three years have seen a reduction in the number of foreign students studying in America’s universities and business schools.”

A Sputnik moment?: Bill Boulding, dean of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, told Power Up that it was ""not too dramatic” to compare the U.S.'s current standing in the global race for high skilled immigrants to a kind of Sputnik moment.

Boulding, who stressed that the open letter is a bipartisan appeal made in the national interest by deans with varying political backgrounds, said high skilled immigration is more important than ever since the U.S. “is in the middle of the fourth industrial revolution.""

Key: “If you don’t have the talent and the knowledge as the rules of economic engagement are being reset, there is an extraordinarily long term risk to the U.S. economy being left behind relative to our current position,” Boulding told us.

There's a substantial imbalance between applicants for H1-B visas and limits the U.S. has imposed on them: ""Following the expiration in 2004 of the 195,000 cap, the number of H-1B visas now annually available has diminished to an adjusted cap of 85,000. Issued on a first-come, first-served basis, every year the demand for H-1B visas outweighs the supply. For instance, in 2019 190,098 H-1B petitions were filed for 85,000 visas,"" according to a white paper released today by the Graduate Management Admission Council.

The Trump effect: Trump, who has previously called for a merit-based immigration system that prioritizes high skilled immigrants, has instead effectively discouraged foreign workers from seeking jobs in the U.S. Our colleague Tracy Jan has written extensively on how Trump has made the process ""increasingly difficult for companies to hire skilled foreign workers … despite the president's call for a merit-based immigration system that prioritizes the admittance of people who are skilled and want to work.”

Denial rates for H1-B visas have spiked under the Trump administration: Data from the National Foundation for American Policy that analyzes data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) show that denial rates have ""increased significantly, rising from 6% in FY 2015 to 32% in the first quarter of FY 2019 for new H-1B petitions for initial employment.""

And application rates are down: The number of petitions for ""high-skilled"" H-1B visas received by USCIS fell last year for the first time in five years -- from 236,000 for the 2017 to 199,000 for 2018, according to a 2018 report from the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The number of petitions for ""high-skilled"" H-1B visas received by USCIS fell last year for the first time in five years -- from 236,000 for the 2017 to 199,000 for 2018, according to a 2018 report from the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric seems to be having an impact: The GMAC's white paper also finds that the current social climate in the U.S. has instilled a sense of fear in prospective business school candidates surveyed.

The GMAC's white paper also finds that the current social climate in the U.S. has instilled a sense of fear in prospective business school candidates surveyed. By the numbers: ""The majority of Indian (54%) and Chinese (50%) candidates surveyed in 2018 agreed that the political environment would prevent them from applying to a US business school. Forty-four percent of Indian candidates and 58 percent of Chinese candidates agreed fear for their safety and security would prevent them from pursuing a US degree,"" according to the study.

Forty-four percent of Indian candidates and 58 percent of Chinese candidates agreed fear for their safety and security would prevent them from pursuing a US degree,"" according to the study. The growth of the foreign born population in the U.S. has also slowed: Data from the Census Bureau’s annual survey of Americans) shows that the foreign-born population in the U.S. grew by about 203,000 between 2017 and 2018. By contrast, between 2010 and 2017, the average growth was about 640,000 foreign born citizens per year.

Unofficial changes to the H1-B application process -- and longer visa processing times-- are preventing companies from getting the talent they need, according to Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. She also told Power Up the increase in H1-B denials are a result of USCIS heightening scrutiny of foreign applicants.

“It feels a lot tougher to get H1B visas these days,” Gelatt told Power Up.

Gelatt told Power Up. “There has been increasing requests for evidence"" to prove that workers are truly highly skilled, Gelatt added. ""Which is when USCIS says, ‘We need more evidence in order to be able to approve or deny this application.'""

Final word: ""Nationalistic silos will ultimately backfire against countries if talent is limited by their own borders. Countries earnestly trying to help their citizens could unintentionally end up doing the opposite,"" Boulding, who also chairs the GMAC board, writes in the introduction to the study.

The Campaign

MORE DEMOCRATS VIEW WARREN AS ELECTABLE: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) isn’t just gaining in the polls. She's also the candidate Democratic primary voters see as the most electable.

That's according to Avalanche Strategy, a liberal communications firm, which found that now ""Warren leads in both the traditional horse race question (29%) and as the preferred president when electability is factored out (32%).""

Avalanche CEO Michiah Prull explains in the study provided early to Power Up: “Warren’s rise in these polls suggests that voters increasingly believe that she can overcome the perceived electability gap and win the election. While many voters continue to believe that their fellow citizens may be less likely to support a female candidate, Warren appears to be persuading many that she can overcome this challenge.""

“Warren’s rise in these polls suggests that voters increasingly believe that she can overcome the perceived electability gap and win the election. While many voters continue to believe that their fellow citizens may be less likely to support a female candidate, Warren appears to be persuading many that she can overcome this challenge."" Avalanche tries to isolate voters' concept of electability by asking the question: If respondents had a magic wand, who would the make president?

If respondents had a magic wand, who would the make president? More on the poll: The survey was conducted from Oct. 1- Oct. 4 with a total sample of 1,043 likely Democratic primary voters and a 3% margin of error.

Major caveat: But the survey also found that Democrats fear a female candidate will have a harder time defeating Trump.

It's not me, it's you: Very few Democrats say that gender affects their own vote, but almost a majority say that it makes other people less likely to vote for a woman. When presented a list of choices, 70% of respondents said they based this on “combined narrative of systematic inequality in America.”

But the most interesting part is how Warren closes the gap. The survey finds that the senators’ supporters are slightly more likely to believe that being a woman makes it harder to win. But they believe Warren can overcome this challenge.

The Investigations

FIONA HILL DROPS BOMBSHELLS IN TESTIMONY: Fiona Hill, the White House's former top Russia adviser, told lawmakers that former national security adviser John Bolton was so alarmed by the effort to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats that he told her to talk to a White House lawyer about it, the New York Times's Peter Baker and Nicholas Fandos report.

Fireworks: ""Mr. Bolton got into a tense exchange on July 10 with Gordon D. Sondland, the Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union, who was working with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer"" on the shadow Ukraine agenda. Hill testified that Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council John Eisenberg about the ""rogue effort"" by Sondland, Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, per the Times.

""Mr. Bolton got into a tense exchange on July 10 with Gordon D. Sondland, the Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union, who was working with Rudolph W.

Hill testified that Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council John Eisenberg about the ""rogue effort"" by Sondland, Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, per the Times. 👀 : ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” Bolton told Hill to tell White House lawyers. (The Times notes: ""Another person in the room initially said Mr. Bolton referred to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mulvaney, but two others said he cited Mr. Sondland."")

Bolton told Hill to tell White House lawyers. (The Times notes: ""Another person in the room initially said Mr. Bolton referred to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mulvaney, but two others said he cited Mr. Sondland."") It wasn't the first time Bolton expressed concerns about Giuliani's campaign to Hill : Trump's personal lawyer was "" a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up ,"" Hill recalled Bolton saying.

"" ,"" Hill recalled Bolton saying. Hill said she confronted Sondland herself over concerns he was overstepping in Ukraine since it was not part of his portfolio: But Sondland said he was in charge of Ukraine, ""a moment she compared to Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.’s declaration that he was in charge after the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt, according to those who heard the testimony."" Sondland apparently told her the president gave him the power to oversee Ukraine policy.

More on why Bolton was so upset: ""Bolton and Sondland met in early July with then-special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, Hill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Sondland’s agenda for Ukraine began to become clear, when he blurted out to the other officials present that there were 'investigations that were dropped that need to be started up again,' according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, the energy company, and Biden — something that made Bolton go 'ballistic' after the meeting, the official said,"" our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Shane Harris and Rachael Bade report.

The expanding probe: Investigators were discussing whether to question Bolton, our colleagues report. Bolton was Hill's direct superior on the National Security Council.

The People

DEEP DIVE ON GORDON SONDLAND: The EU ambassador flipped-flop on his initial opinions about Trump -- but after becoming the envoy to Brussels began to believe that he could ascend even higher in the Trump administration, our colleagues Aaron C. Davis, Josh Dawsey, Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Michael Birnbaum report.

The Portland, Ore., hotelier and philanthropist had long sought a high-profile appointment such as an ambassadorship in exchange for his work as a Republican bundler corraling wealthy West Coast donors, our colleagues write, and Jeb Bush dropping out of the 2016 primary was a major disappointment.

""To realize his goal, Sondland made a political about-face and backed Donald Trump, a candidate he once said was out of touch with his 'personal beliefs and values on so many levels.' After the election, Sondland contributed $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee. And he began calling in political favors — including from Republican National Committee chairman turned White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus — to convince Trump that he could be a team player.""

Our colleagues scooped some more details on Sondland's testimony later this week:

He'll tell investigators Giuliani had control over a potential meeting between Ukraine's leader and Trump: ""Trump told him, [Volker] and [Perry] that any face-to-face meeting he would entertain with the new Ukrainian president would have to be cleared by Giuliani,"" our colleagues write.

""Trump told him, [Volker] and [Perry] that any face-to-face meeting he would entertain with the new Ukrainian president would have to be cleared by Giuliani,"" our colleagues write. And Giuliani apparently made clear what was expected: ""Sondland plans to say that over the following weeks, he and Volker, along with the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, learned that as a condition of such a meeting, Giuliani was demanding that Zelensky’s administration publicly announce it would tackle corruption , including singling out as a target Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company linked to Biden’s son.""

""Sondland plans to say that over the following weeks, he and Volker, along with the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, learned that as a condition of such a meeting, , including singling out as a target Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company linked to Biden’s son."" Giuliani disputed this to our colleagues: He said Sondland ""seemed to be in charge” of the overall effort and that Volker came up with the statement. Giuliani also said Volker and Sondland were involved with getting Ukraine to name Burisma.

The revealing ancedotes: ""In public appearances and in private meetings, Sondland often came off like a version of Trump with the roughest edges sanded off, according to diplomats who interacted with him,"" our colleagues write.

Some of those Trumpian comments: Sondland ""once declared to American business representatives that unlike his predecessors he would 'get s--- done,' according to people who were present. He called the European Union 'out of touch' and accused it of stalling on trade talks with the Trump administration. And he called himself a 'disruptive diplomat.'""

He called the European Union 'out of touch' and accused it of stalling on trade talks with the Trump administration. And he called himself a 'disruptive diplomat.'"" Sondland appears to have lavish tastes: Upon his arrival, ""he began updating the U.S. ambassador’s baronial residence on the leafy outskirts of Brussels, an effort that was still underway last week, according to a guard who said the residence was closed for extensive renovations,"" our colleagues write, adding records show a $25,000 contract to an American rug company. It was “real 18th century Jefferson-in-Paris behavior,” a senior U.S. official said. (A person who has spoken to Sondland defended the upgrades as a necessary expense.)

""A person close to Sondland disputed that notion, but other officials said Sondland had been talked about in the administration as a possible successor to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.""

TRUMP CALLS FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN NORTHERN SYRIA: ""The Trump administration called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to implement an immediate cease-fire in northern Syria and imposed sanctions against Turkey,"" our colleagues Seung Min Kim and Karen DeYoung report, ""as the situation on the ground continued to deteriorate after [Trump’s] decision to withdraw U.S. forces.""

Trump talks to Erdogan: Vice President Pence said that Erdogan and Trump spoke by phone. Pence said Trump “communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, to implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence.""

Mitch McConnell adds to bipartisan backlash after Trump's troop pullout from northern Syria: The Senate majority leader said he was “gravely concerned” about the U.S. response to the escalating conflict in Syria, Politico's Marianne Levine reports. ""Abandoning this fight now and withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,” McConnell said. His statement did not mention Trump by name.

Global Power

ON THE GROUND: ""Forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad advanced Monday into several key towns across northeastern Syria after an 11th-hour deal with local Kurdish fighters, dramatically altering the balance of power inside the war-battered country,"" our colleagues Erin Cunningham, Sarah Dadouch, Asser Khattab and Dan Lamothe report.

The deal ""aims to forestall a Turkish assault against the Kurds,"" our colleagues write: ""Turkey has been pressing an offensive against Syrian Kurdish fighters because of their links to Kurdish militants inside Turkey. The military campaign has been condemned by many of Turkey’s Western allies, including the United States, which have warned in part that the escalating violence could give the Islamic State a chance to regenerate its insurgency less than a year after the militant group’s territorial 'caliphate' was defeated.""

Even a week of fighting has taken a huge toll: The United Nations reported ""that as many as 160,000 people, including 70,000 children, have been displaced since the fighting in northeast Syria escalated nearly a week ago.""

Aid groups have also been forced to pull out: ""As the violence has spiked, aid agencies have been scaling back or suspending humanitarian operations because of shelling, road closures and other threats,"" our colleagues write. ""All international aid groups have now withdrawn their personnel, according to the Kurdish Red Crescent.""

Key quote: ""This is our nightmare scenario. There are tens of thousands of people on the run, and we have no way of getting to them,” Made Ferguson, deputy country director for Syria at Mercy Corps, a U.S.-based aid agency, told our colleagues.

THE DEMOCRATIC DOZEN: 12, yes, 12 candidates, will share a single stage tonight in Ohio with under four months to go until the Iowa caucuses.

Here's a quick look at what the top-polling candidates need to do tonight:

Joe Biden: ""I've got to be more aggressive,"" he told donors last week. While the former vice president was focused on his past debate performances, his campaign has been subject to scrutiny that initially failed to punch back hard enough against Trump's unproven allegations of corruption. But Biden has shifted in the last few days, the New York Times's Katie Glueck and Alexander Burns report. Now he's scorching Trump on the trail and rolling out an ethics plan.

Hunter speaks: For the first time since Trump began his attacks, Hunter Biden will speak publicly this morning. His interview on ""Good Morning America"" will be closely watched, particularly for how he handles criticism of his decision to serve on the board of Burisma. Hunter Biden resigned from his board seat on a Chinese company over the weekend and pledged to not conduct any foreign business should his father win the presidency.

Elizabeth Warren: As the Massachusetts senator continues to surge in the polls, ""it's advantage Warren,"" as Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, told Politico's David Siders. But do the gloves finally come off tonight?

Her rivals are circling: Biden is subtly shading her for having too many plans, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants you to know she's a capitalist and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg continues to needle her over how she'll pay for her health care plan.

Bernie Sanders: This is his first debate since his heart attack. Our colleague Sean Sullivan reports the debate ""is shaping up as a defining moment for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is seeking to rebound from a heart attack that has clouded the future of his candidacy and the leftist political movement he has built over decades.""

The contrast: ""Buttigieg, 37, and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, 47 — will also appear onstage, creating the potential for lively discussions of age,"" Sean writes.

In the Media

VIOLENT VIDEO WAS PRODUCED BY TRUMP'S ALLIES: ""The creator of a gruesome video that showed a fake [Trump] killing journalists and political opponents and that was played at a meeting of a pro-Trump group over the weekend is part of a loose network of right-wing provocateurs with a direct line to the White House,"" the Times's Annie Karni, Kevin Roose and Katie Rogers report.

More on those behind the video: ""Another of the provocateurs, Logan Cook, who often has posted videos on MemeWorld, his website, participated in a social media summit at the White House in July and took his children to meet the president in the Oval Office, accompanied by Dan Scavino, the White House social media director,"" the Times reports.

The larger story: ""The connections underscore how the president’s escalating war on what he calls the 'fake news' media has elevated people from the far-right fringe into presidential allies who defend him with extreme language and images.""

""The connections underscore how the president’s escalating war on what he calls the 'fake news' media has elevated people from the far-right fringe into presidential allies who defend him with extreme language and images."" Trump did not mention the video on Monday, but White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham condemned it. The three headliners of the conference: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Donald Trump Jr. all said they did not see the video and also condemned it.

A warning to Biden, however: 51 percent are “somewhat satisfied” with Biden’s response to Trump’s attacks, while only 23 percent are “very satisfied.”

In New Hampshire, the same poll has Warren at 32 percent, Biden at 24, Sanders at 17 and Buttigieg at 7. There, too, Biden does better on electability and ability to keep Americans safe. Meanwhile, Biden holds a commanding lead in South Carolina (43 vs. 18 percent) over Warren.

Warren now faces the challenges that come with front-runner status, including dealing with high expectations for the early primaries and being the target of attacks from opponents and of criticism from the media. She has yet to be strongly challenged on the debate stage on the math for her wealth tax, the funding for her Medicare-for-all plan and her views on national security. Although she has shown steady improvement with African American and non-college-educated voters, her support still rests mostly on college-educated white progressives. Finally, she faces the nagging concern as to whether she is too far left to prevail in the general election, although Sanders handed her a gift in declaring, “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones.”

As polls show, her margin over Trump in the general election about equals Biden’s; “electability” concerns may fade. Consistent work in reaching out to African American voters (without the kind of unrealistic promises they have, over decades, learned to view with extreme skepticism) can help increase her appeal with the most critical Democratic bloc in the primaries. Beyond that, Warren might plan to take the wind out of the predictable attacks she will face.

First, she still faces the commander in chief test, a requirement of any presidential candidate but especially so in light of Trump’s mismanagement of national security from North Korea to Russia to Saudi Arabia to China. Warren would do well to issue a robust condemnation of Trump’s retreat from Syria and explain how she would wind down “forever wars” without endangering allies, giving a shot in the arm to Islamic State terrorists and losing allies’ confidence. Will she be guided by conditions on the ground? How will she reestablish U.S. credibility with allies? On China, she needs to articulate a policy that distinguishes her from Trump and communicates seriousness about protecting American values and interests. Democratic voters might not put national security at the top of their list of concerns, but polls repeatedly show voters remain concerned about terrorism and keeping our alliances strong.

Second, at some point she’s going to have to make the case that she is flexible, savvy and wise enough to know how to take a half or three-quarters of a loaf. When Medicare-for-all proves to be unattainable, does she have a backup plan? If she cannot raise enough revenue from her wealth tax, what does she do with her assortment of domestic programs?

Trump made promises in 2016 he could not keep: getting Mexico to pay for the wall, coming up with a cheaper but better health-care plan and developing a tax cut that wouldn’t make the rich even richer. One of Democrats’ best lines of attack is that Trump not only did not produce for the “forgotten man and women,” but he also made life harder for them.

A candidate who comes across as peddling easy fixes and unattainable deals will not be nearly as effective as a candidate who levels with voters and makes clear what can be reasonably accomplished. The answer to criticism cannot be to ridicule critics as “thinking small,” nor can every explanation for achieving unreasonable goals be “I’ll fight.”

In sum, by presenting a mainstream foreign policy vision and giving herself and moderate voters an off-ramp or two on the highway to progressive nirvana, Warren can solidify her gains and win over skeptics. If she can do that, she will be hard to stop.

COLORADO SPRINGS — On Sunday, nearly every Democrat running for the right to challenge Sen. Cory Gardner (R) made it to a climate forum, organized by liberal activists and environmental groups.

To get there, they walked past a lobby where members of the Sunrise Movement held a small protest of the Democrat who was not there — John Hickenlooper, the two-term governor and former candidate for president. When they got to the stage, they arranged themselves next to an empty chair with Hickenlooper's name on it. Before they started talking, activists led a brief chant of ""Where's Hick?""

""Any Democrat running against Cory Gardner is slated to win,"" said Trish Zornio, one of the 11 Democrats running against Hickenlooper. ""The data is on our side. You can pick the candidate that you like. It's a wonderful thing: A potted plant would probably win in November.""

Colorado, a swing state where the Republican Party has lost a run of Trump-era elections, is one of the key 2020 battlegrounds for control of the Senate. In August, when national Democrats persuaded Hickenlooper to run — he had previously ruled it out — the party celebrated, confident in polling that showed the popular, moderate ""Hick"" far ahead of Gardner.

But Hickenlooper's choice turned the Senate primary from a jumble of credible candidates to something Democrats are getting used to: a front-runner who's not on board with the left's priorities and a pack of insurgents who can't win if they split the vote. And unlike the party's race for president, where Joe Biden has been out-fundraised by a number of opponents, Hickenlooper came into the race with a money advantage, long ties with labor unions and the clear support of the national party.

""In my analysis of getting into the race, I thought I could reach out to progressives, to women, to environmental groups, to unions,"" said Alice Madden, a former state House majority leader who, like most Democrats, has struggled to get attention. ""Hickenlooper getting in has had the effect of them all saying, 'Well, gosh, maybe we'll just wait and see what happens.' And the longer people delay on endorsing, the more the momentum behind him is seemingly inevitable.""

The primary epitomizes the left's struggle inside the Democratic Party. In the race for president, the left has succeeded in shaping the debate around health care, with Medicare-for-all now the focal point. It assigned new litmus tests on climate, with every candidate agreeing to reject energy industry money and most endorsing some version of the Green New Deal.

To enact any of that, activists need 218 votes in the House and at least 51 in the Senate. They are far from those numbers now, and in every Senate race Democrats think they could win next year — in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina — the Democrats leading in polls and backed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee don't support the agenda of presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Feelings are especially raw in Colorado, where Hickenlooper has clashed with activists on energy policy, an issue that has grown to existential importance on the left. Elected governor in 2010, Hickenlooper allowed natural gas exploration and mining to expand in Colorado, a carrot-and-stick approach that helped pass some methane emissions regulations. That put him in constant conflict with environmental activists, who, if he became the party's nominee for Senate, would be pressured to send him to Washington.

""I am totally worried about this race, because people are going to be like: 'Hey, what's the difference between John Hickenlooper and Cory Gardner?' "" said Joe Salazar, who narrowly lost a 2018 bid for attorney general and now directs the left-wing group Colorado Rising. (He is neutral in the Senate race.) ""Look, because the DSCC jumped in, everyone thought that he was just the anointed one. But people are rising up against him now. I would invite him to come out to Broomfield, or Commerce City — to a place that's being fracked to death. Let's see how popular he is there.""

Initially, with Hickenlooper seemingly committed to a White House bid, more than a dozen lesser-known Democrats piled in to challenge Gardner. The Republican, elected narrowly in 2014, had become less and less popular with Trump in office as his party declined locally. Gardner had won his first term with 983,891 votes; four years later, the GOP's gubernatorial candidate won 1,080,801 votes and lost by 10 points amid surging Democratic turnout.

Hickenlooper's decision to run for Senate, one week after he abandoned his presidential bid, made him an immediate favorite. Polling in August found him with 61 percent support in a massively crowded field. Two Democrats who'd attracted early money quickly left the race, leaving Hickenlooper with a more outwardly left-wing group of challengers. Each had the same path to victory: turning this Senate race into a cause, a chance for activists in Colorado and every other state to change their party.

The first candidate who took advantage of that story line was Andrew Romanoff, a former state House speaker with experience: He'd run an unsuccessful left-wing insurgent bid against Sen. Michael Bennet 10 years earlier. Within a week of Hickenlooper's announcement, Romanoff claimed that multiple consultants had walked away from his campaign, afraid of losing business if they challenged the DSCC. That 2010 run, and a 2014 campaign for the House, have helped Romanoff build a small but loyal base of supporters who want their fellow Democrats to see what they see.

""I voted for you,"" said Chris Kalfehn, 60, as Romanoff worked the room at a Saturday candidate forum in Denver.

""You have one last chance!"" said Romanoff.

In an interview after the Denver candidate forum this week, Romanoff said that the consultant mess was a ""hiccup"" and that the campaign had gotten past it. It could be an advantage, he said, that he was ""not making friends in D.C.,"" all while he was winning local endorsements and working to consolidate liberal voters.

""Whoever wins this nomination will instantly pick up the support from all the other candidates, and their teams, and progressives across the country,"" said Romanoff. ""So I reject the idea that somehow you've got to elect the guy who's got the most money now. You'll have the money you need to win this race if you're willing to do the work. The real question is, do you have something to say? Can you actually rally the troops? Can you inspire your voters to come out?""

Hickenlooper, who skipped the weekend's forums but will attend others, acknowledges that the party's support came with downsides. ""We are an intensely independent state, and if it could have been my choice, yeah, I probably would have waited,"" he said in an interview. ""I would have preferred that they waited a few months. But that being said, they were looking at what they thought was the highest and best way to get a Democrat elected and take Cory Gardner's seat away from the Republicans. And so, they supported me. I think it's a great compliment.""

On Tuesday, Hickenlooper's campaign announced that it had raised $2.1 million in the first six weeks of his candidacy, more than he'd raised in his final months as a presidential candidate. And in this primary, Hickenlooper's bigger advantage could be the size of his opposition. There are nearly nine months until the primary; before that, candidates will need to circulate petitions, then compete at the state assembly, a convention that determines who makes it onto the ballot and what order they appear in.

Hickenlooper's many challengers expect that to sort out as they campaign around the state. There's not much talk, right now, about consolidation. At the climate forum, environmental activist Diana Bray criticized candidates who had made political peace with the energy industry — a veiled reference to Romanoff. Eight of the non-Hickenlooper Democrats are women, and Colorado has never sent a woman to the Senate, an issue that doesn't help Romanoff.

That dynamic was helping candidates with less electoral success in their pasts than Hickenlooper or Romanoff — like Stephany Rose Spaulding, who had run unsuccessfully for Congress in a deep red district last year, or Lorena Garcia, a liberal activist who tells audiences that she would abolish ICE and that her ""policies are the same"" as presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.).

On Saturday, after a three-hour candidate forum with several knocks on the absent Hickenlooper, Garcia headed out to a nearby suburb to campaign for local candidates. After dropping off literature, Garcia talked to Democrats, at their doors, about her own campaign.

""It can be a really good education for voters,"" Garcia said. ""You have lots of time to explain this. Sure, you can elect somebody for president. But you need to put people in the Senate who are going to uphold that person's vision.""

She dropped another candidate's leaflet in a door, then added one of hers. ""You don't need to nominate a has-been.""

The candidate who won statewide in Colorado in 2018 was originally misidentified. This has been corrected.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Anyone who read ""A Fighting Chance,"" Warren's first political memoir, read the story of how she stopped teaching special-needs students.

""By the end of the school year, I was pretty obviously pregnant,"" Warren wrote in 2014. ""The principal did what I think a lot of principals did back then — wished me good luck, didn't ask me back for the next school year, and hired someone else for the job.""

Five and a half years later, before a Friday night crowd in San Diego, Warren told the same story, with a few new flourishes.

“I loved those babies,” she said of her students. “I still remember their faces.” Then the twist: “By the end of my first year in teaching, I was visibly pregnant. The principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

It's a foundational story for Warren, which was why danger loomed for her over the weekend when the story came into question. First, in a tweet, the Jacobin writer Meagan Day pointed to a 2007 speech in which Warren described her departure from teaching in a different way. (Day is co-writing a book about how democratic socialism can advance from the Sanders presidential campaigns.)

""I did that for a year,"" Warren said of teaching, ""and then that summer, I actually didn't have the education courses, so I was on an emergency certificate, it was called.""

Day's initial point was that the experience of Warren, who tells audiences that she had a ""calling"" to become a public school teacher, didn't exactly square with the short time she spent teaching. Over the next few days, the story took on different shapes. After Day's tweet caught fire, the Republican National Committee sent links to the 2007 speech to reporters. Mediaite, followed by a series of conservative media outlets, reportedly flatly that Warren had ""lied"" about pregnancy costing her a job. And on Monday afternoon, the Washington Free Beacon published the minutes of meetings in which the Riverside, N.J., board of education first confirmed that Warren had been rehired and then, two months later, said that she had resigned.

Warren, whose early campaign struggled to recover from her past claims of Native American heritage, had been much more ready for this story. It had obtained the Riverside minutes earlier this year. Last month, before any of the new speculation about her teaching career, the campaign had been cooperating with CBS News on a story that explored whether or not she was ""shown the door,"" as she sometimes put it. But the other outlets' stories moved faster than expected, and Warren went on camera with CBS News, supplementing that with tweets in which she stood by her personal narrative.

“When I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant — and the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else,” she tweeted. “This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination — but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.”

Any campaign that becomes competitive deals with scrutiny at this level. The Warren campaign's response was fast, but it did not stop the initial speculation about her truthfulness. By Tuesday afternoon, the takes on Warren had fallen close to partisan lines, with conservative media portraying it as another round of possible biography inflation (Fox News: ""Warren faces mounting questions on another part of her personal story"") and liberal or nonpartisan media portraying it as the candidate debunking accusations (NBC News: ""Elizabeth Warren stands by account of pregnancy discrimination""). On social media, people who both do and do not support Warren chimed in with accounts of mothers, or female relatives, or themselves losing jobs because of pregnancy.

""This happened to women ALL the time... why the attacks on Elizabeth Warren?"" tweeted Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""Many women would also leave knowing they would be fired.""

The Warren campaign avoided, for now, a debacle along the lines of the DNA test. Among other campaigns, there was some frustration at how the Riverside minutes, initially packaged as evidence to debunk Warren, ended up matching her timeline, especially after contemporary documentation of how pregnant women did not have true job protection until several years later. (The 2007 video, in which she blows past the reasons she stopped teaching, had looked more problematic for her — less so after they learned details of the school district's decision.)

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

DEBATE SEASON

It’s official: The fifth Democratic debate, with the highest entry threshold yet, will be held Nov. 20 — co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. To qualify for the debate, in Georgia, Democrats will need to prove by midnight on Nov.13 that they attracted 160,000 donations and polled at 3 percent or higher in four polls, or at 5 percent or higher in two polls of the first four primary states.

AD WATCH

Truth in Politics, ""My Chance."" An independent group in Louisiana is doing what Republican candidates have been trying for months: Asking how Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards could have hired Johnny Anderson, a former deputy chief of staff, despite a previous sexual harassment investigation. Anderson was later fired after a new claim against him. This ad, complementing a Republican Governors Association-backed spot, stars Anderson's final accuser, identified only as Juanita W; her full name is Juanita Washington.

""John Bel says people over politics?"" Washington asks, repeating the governor's slogan. ""Not when you're a woman like me.""

John Bel Edwards, ""We Know Gov. Edwards."" The response to the final-week ad assault on the Anderson fracas is a common one: a parade of women vouching for the Democrat accused of not caring about them. ""When an employee committed sexual harassment, Governor Edwards demanded his resignation within hours,"" one supporter says in the spot. Nothing much has changed about the Anderson story in the past few years; the question is whether Edwards had recovered politically because the scandal fell out of the news or because voters assessed it and didn't blame him.

POLL WATCH

Ethics in government (Washington Post-Schar School, 1,007 voters)

Does President Trump uphold adequate standards for ethics in government?

No — 60%

Yes — 35%

Would a President Joe Biden uphold adequate standards for ethics in government?

He would — 47%

He would not — 38%

A growing number of voters are comfortable with impeachment and even more of them are comfortable saying that the president created the conditions for investigations with bad behavior. What The Post's polling also shows is how the partisan sentiments around this have hardened. In just two weeks, a solid majority of Republicans have become convinced that Biden, who was never previously accused of corruption in a half-century political career, has loose ethics.

President Trump and impeachment (Quinnipiac, 1,483 registered voters)

Do you approve of the way the president is handling the impeachment inquiry?

Disapprove — 57%

Approve — 34%

Is the impeachment inquiry legitimate, or a witch hunt?

Legitimate — 51%

Witch hunt — 43%

Did the president press foreign leaders for information on Biden to hurt him, or to expose corruption?

Hurt Biden — 48%

Expose corruption — 33%

One of the more interesting moves Republicans made after the impeachment inquiry began was to lay down a challenge: Democrats should hold an up-or-down impeachment vote. This poll, which also finds Trump trailing in a general election against the Democrats' three current polling leaders, finds the highest level of public anger at how the president is handling the investigation. Asked if he was really trying to expose corruption, asked if he's handling the accusations well, a chunk of his otherwise-stable support walks away.

2020

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a new campaign finance agenda that would quickly affect how Democrats fund their 2020 convention and election plans, banning corporate contributions for the nominating ceremony in Milwaukee. That's something Sanders could do as a nominee, with a majority of Democratic delegates; other parts of the plan, like national public financing elections, would require a governing majority.

Kamala Harris. She introduced a ""children's justice"" agenda with six months of paid leave for new parents. Current federal law doesn't mandate any leave whatsoever.

Elizabeth Warren. She's returning to the trail with a Wednesday stop in Orangeburg, S.C., for an appearance with House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, promoting legislation that they've worked on together.

Steve Bullock. From Thursday through Sunday, he'll stump in New Hampshire and Iowa for a ""Great Equalizers"" policy tour. Those equalizers, in case there's a test later: public education, public lands and ""public participation in our democracy.""

Andrew Yang. He held a meeting with Asian American critics last week, impressing an attendee, Frank Shyong, who published a column about the outcome. ""I’m a person of our community who I believe understands the concerns of the community and wants very deeply and passionately to represent them to the best of my ability,"" Yang said. The candidate will head to New Hampshire on Thursday, campaigning there through Sunday.

Marianne Williamson. She's in South Carolina on Tuesday and Wednesday, starting with a ""Politics and Pints"" appearance with the Charleston Post and Courier.

Michael F. Bennet. He told Fox News, when asked about the Warren pregnancy story, that candidates were all “going to go through this X-ray of the soul"" and that ""the people who have been consistent and truthful about where they are, are going to stand up well.""

Tulsi Gabbard. In an interview with Reason, she took some credit for Harris’s decline in the polls, which began after the second debate and Gabbard’s two rounds of attacks on the California senator. “I'm for the people, man,"" Gabbard replies, laughing. ""I was speaking the truth, and speaking for a lot of people.""

The endorsements could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer.

President Trump has attacked the members of the Squad, at one point suggesting they should “go back” to their own countries — even though they are American citizens — and has sought to make them the face of the Democratic Party. He recently held a rally in Omar’s district.

Sanders and Warren have been battling for the support of the women, holding individual meetings with them, co-sponsoring their legislation and wishing them well on social media. On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled legislation with Omar to enact a universal school meals program.

Photo: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images

The fourth Democratic presidential candidates’ debate, which will take place on Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio, is going to be held in the shadow of the impeachment drama unfolding in Washington. A key question for moderators (CNN’s Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and the New York Times’ Marc Lacey) and debaters alike will be how and how much to talk about this topic. They cannot just ignore it; that would be the functional equivalent of a debate shortly after 9/11 that shirked national-security issues. That’s how big a deal it is when a serious threat of presidential impeachment develops, and given Donald Trump’s dominant presence in the consciousness of Democrats as well as Republicans, it’s a megaissue. But there are multiple reasons this won’t be easy to debate next week.

1. The Candidates All Agree on Impeachment

Earlier in the presidential-campaign cycle, support for impeachment proceedings against Trump was a controversial proposition — so much so that in April when Elizabeth Warren became the first in the huge field to call the Mueller report sufficient grounds for an impeachment inquiry, it was something of a sensation (yes, Tom Steyer spent an impressive share of his large fortune promoting impeachment long before that, but he did not become a candidate until July).

After Pelosi formally announced impeachment proceedings on September 24, impeachment skeptics Joe Biden and Tulsi Gabbard made it unanimous, with all 19 candidates in agreement with this step.

There are elements of impeachment strategy that are still debatable among Democrats, such as the scope of the inquiry (and of subsequent articles of impeachment), and its timing, and perhaps how House Democrats should deal with Trump’s obstruction. But this is pretty dry and technical stuff, and the candidates probably don’t want to look like they are second-guessing Pelosi. Expressing fury at Trump is always a good idea for Democratic candidates, but a little bit goes a long way.

You can expect Steyer to make a big deal out of his early efforts to pressure the House to impeach Trump, but beyond that (and perhaps Warren’s similar claim to pro-impeachment sentiments before it was politically safe), no one really has bragging rights.

2. Trump’s Removal Would Fundamentally Change the Democratic Primary

The odds remain very high that if Trump is impeached by the House (a very good bet at this point), he will be quickly acquitted by the Senate. But it would be in questionable taste for Democratic presidential candidates to publicly admit that right now, at a time when some observers see Trump drifting into peril and Republicans (mostly privately) expressing doubts about his conduct and his political strategy.

So in talking about Trump and impeachment, the candidates vying to become his vanquisher in November 2020 are in the awkward position of discussing and promoting an event that would make their own competition wildly different if not irrelevant. What are they supposed to do? Boast of how they will tear Mike Pence a new one? Make the general election a referendum on why it took Republicans so long to abandon their corrupt leader? It’s a tough set of questions — again, for moderators as well as for debaters.

3. Five of the Debaters Are Potential “Jurors” in a Senate Trial of the President

It’s a convention rather than any sort of constitutional requirement, but in the past, senators looking forward to impeachment trials tended to make no public statements about the matter. This is in accordance with the popular notion that an impeachment is like a criminal indictment and the trial is like — well, a criminal trial. This is an analogy, not a real description, of the impeachment process (which is unlike any other quasi-judicial proceeding), but it has some power: In the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, senators made speeches explaining their votes in a closed session; they were only made public after the trial had ended. Here’s how the New York Times explained the Senate’s pretensions of objectivity in the Clinton trial:

One after another, as their names are called alphabetically, the senators rise behind their desks and utter the first words they have spoken about the matter in public session since the impeachment trial began. No speeches. No explanation. Just “guilty” or “not guilty.”

Procedures for a prospective trial of Trump will be determined by the Senate itself on a simple majority vote once impeachment occurs, which means Mitch McConnell and his Republicans can call all the shots if they wish and can remain united. It’s unlikely he will do anything to make life easy for the senators running for president, so if he can impose some sort of gag rule, he will.

The only sitting House member among those who qualified for Tuesday’s debate is Tulsi Gabbard, who may not add her distinct perspective on impeachment because she is threatening to boycott the event as part of a DNC–media effort to “rig” the nomination process.

4. One of the Candidates Is a Key Figure in the Impeachment Saga

Still another factor that makes any debate over impeachment next week difficult is that Joe Biden, via his son Hunter, is himself one of the dramatis personae in the impeachment saga. Indeed, how it all plays out could have a significant impact for good or for ill on Biden’s own campaign.

Knowing that, the former veep’s campaign is not-so-subtly warning his rivals to stay away from saying anything in the debate that could reinforce Trump’s savage attacks on both Bidens, as Bloomberg reports:

Joe Biden has a warning for his Democratic rivals as they prepare for the fourth televised debate next week: Stay away from the issue of Ukraine and Hunter Biden …

An aide to Biden said that any candidate who “calls themselves a ‘Democrat’” and repeats what the aide said were “discredited lies” about Biden and his son “would be making a profound statement about themselves.”

But a number of Biden’s rivals had already said critical things about Hunter Biden’s sketchy career as an international wheeler and dealer, before it assumed such a central position in the case for impeachment:

As Trump has escalated his attacks against Joe and Hunter Biden, Biden’s Democratic rivals have been walking a tightrope. All of them are campaigning against Trump and most have called for his impeachment. Yet getting the chance to challenge the incumbent president requires first winning the nomination. So many of the candidates have criticized Biden for “allowing” Hunter Biden to serve on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was vice president, saying any appearance of a conflict of interest is problematic.

If any of the debaters fall off that tightrope and go after Hunter, his father could very well exploit the moment to depict himself as the victim of an infamous Trump smear, and also as the candidate Trump fears enough to risk impeachment to smear. Suffice it to say there is some nervous debate prep under way on the subject.

Perhaps the moderators for the Ohio debate will decide it’s all too difficult to delve into impeachment, and the candidates will skirt it as well. But on a stage holding 12 candidates hungry for attention, they must all deal with the possibility that someone will bring it up and run with it."

Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, Donald Trump’s frantic attempts at an impeachment defense, efforts by Bill Barr and Mike Pompeo to protect themselves from Ukraine fallout, and Bernie Sanders’s health issues.

A week in, Trump’s defense to the growing impeachment proceedings seems to be tantrums and denial. Is there a cost to failing to develop a more focused plan, or will this strategy help him slip out of trouble, as it has in the past?

We can safely assume that even Trump’s most ardent fans would not put him and “focused plan” or “strategy” in the same sentence. His brand is chaos, and his default position is human (or more often inhuman) wrecking ball. That will never change, nor does he want it to change. The question is less whether Trump’s malevolence will allow him to escape impeachment than whether American governance, already on the ropes, will tumble into a coma before he leaves office and allow opportunistic American enemies like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un to pounce. An ancillary question is whether Trump will in fact leave the Oval Office voluntarily if he is convicted in an impeachment trial or defeated in the election that’s now 13 months away. A president who finds new constitutional norms to violate daily can hardly be counted upon to respect the verdicts of either Congress or the voters.

A third question is his sanity. Even by his standards, yesterday’s #TrumpMeltdown was wild. The nation saw him tossing around a jockstrap insult (aimed at Adam Schiff) in an ornate White House setting as the Finnish president trapped beside him tried, with mixed results, to maintain a poker-faced dignity. We watched Trump in desperation cite abject GOP lapdogs like Lindsey Graham, Rick Scott, and Rob Portman as character witnesses. We watched him lie with his usual heedlessness and velocity, but as often as not his fictions undermined his own craven self-interest: By referring to the White House’s readout of his fateful July 25 call with the Ukrainian president as a “word-for-word, comma-for-comma” transcript, he was attempting to further the cover-up in plain sight. All you need is eyes to see that this document is not labeled a “transcript” and is too brief to be the entirety of what was officially listed as a 30-minute presidential conversation. (Interns in the office of one senator, Angus King of Maine, read the released version aloud and clocked it at roughly ten minutes.) Not to mention that the “comma-for-comma” White House readout contains ellipses — which may yet prove to be tantamount to the notorious 18-and-a-half-minute gap on an incriminating Nixon White House tape.

Trump retains enough animal cunning to know he’s in jeopardy. New Deep Throats are surfacing in the press (especially at the Washington Post) daily. The polls are starting to shift. Members of Congress are home talking to their constituents over recess. Even Mitch McConnell budged a tiny bit, letting the release of the whistle-blower complaint proceed without senatorial interference and going on record that he cannot prevent impeachment from being taken up by his chamber. At the height of yesterday’s #TrumpMeltdown, the Dow was plummeting 500 points on trade-war fears. And Trump is running low on rhetorical ammunition to fight back. His repeated characterization of the July 25 phone conversation as “perfect” and “beautiful” is not just false but adjectivally weird. Writing “BULLSHIT” in a tweet attacking his opponents is an indicator of desperation as well as his usual vulgarity. Running out of words, he is more dependent than ever on the feedback loop of Fox News for fresh gambits: His new claim to be the victim of a “coup” originated there, as did his threat that his impeachment would lead to “civil war.”

Could he and his country sink even lower while impeachment is adjudicated? Quite possibly; there seems to be no bottom. If this historical moment echoes Watergate in some regards, it also echoes the rise of toxic anti-government rhetoric and right-wing American terrorist militias and cults in the period leading up to the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Back then it was the likes of NRA chief Wayne LaPierre who were railing against “jack-booted government thugs.” Now it’s the president of the United States who is doing so, relentlessly suggesting that Schiff, the whistle-blower, and members of the press (among others) be punished for committing treason. And he is doing so in a society that is, if anything, even more gun-crazy and gun-saturated now than it was in the 1990s.

Let’s be clear here: As he retreats more and more into his bunker, Trump is not being careful about what he wishes for, and what he is wishing for is violence. Yet the Vichy Republicans — even those senators up for reelection like Susan Collins and Cory Gardner — remain silent. Be assured that they’ll be among the first to offer their thoughts and prayers on camera if this dam breaks.

Ukraine-related questions have continued to grow around Attorney General Bill Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both of whom seem to be doing everything they can to sidestep direct questioning. Will their stonewalling protect them?

No. Nor will stonewalling protect the increasingly implicated Mike Pence. Pompeo, the cagiest of the three, has started to figure this out — probably because he realized he would fail in his attempt to stop former State Department officials like the special Ukraine envoy Karl Volker and the summarily fired U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, from talking to investigators. That’s why it took only days for Pompeo to go from lying and dissembling about what he knew about the Ukraine call and when he knew it to conceding he was present. This is surely a smarter legal strategy than Pence’s; as Jonathan Chait has pointed out, the vice-president is claiming essentially that he was too stupid to understand what was going on all around him, even when he was participating in the White House’s Ukrainian plot. As for Barr, he continues hobnobbing all over the world to do both Trump and Putin’s bidding in pursuing a crackpot conspiracy theory that would clear Russia of 2016 election interference and implicate Ukraine instead. One could argue that even Rudy Giuliani has more sense than Barr does: This week he recruited a former Watergate prosecutor to represent him in impeachment proceedings.

Bernie Sanders announced that he has been hospitalized with a heart issue, and had two stents inserted. Do health concerns change his standing in the Democratic primary?

Assuming that the public diagnoses by cardiologists hold up, the answer is no. Sanders will return to the stump after a fairly brief break, and only if he stops shouting upon return should he or his supporters start to worry.

What’s more interesting is that there are few signs that Trump’s anti-Biden jihad is shaking up the Democratic primary either, despite the president referring to him and his son as “stone-cold crooked” and such antics as today’s, in which he publicly urged China to investigate them. Both Sanders and Biden have been slipping in polls while Elizabeth Warren is gaining, but neither is tanking, and both are very much in what’s still a fluid race. Biden’s decision to employ some rare reticence in handling Trump’s baseless charges against his son may be his shrewdest move so far in the campaign."

I’m not sure if you’ve heard, maybe you don’t know, I don’t want to presume, but there’s an impeachment inquiry going on. You’re shocked, I understand. “The president? Bad?” you ask. It’s possible. Who can say? That’s what the inquiry is for.

But already, there is a media war being waged over public perception, and one of the most important battlegrounds is Facebook, where impeachment-related ads are being bought at a rapid pace. On Wednesday, Axios reported that the Trump campaign spent $718,000 on ads related to the impeachment inquiry between September 29 and October 5 (the data was compiled by the third-party research firm Bully Pulpit Interactive). Other parties have also been spending vigorously to rally Facebook users for or against impeachment. Mitch McConnell spent $40,000, Elizabeth Warren spent $20,000. Billionaire and fringe candidate Tom Steyer, who spends millions on Facebook ads for shits and giggles, has spent $86,000 to boost posts related to the topic into users’ News Feeds.

But second to Trump, the entity spending the most on Facebook ads related to impeachment is a Wisconsin-based spice company, Penzeys Spices. “You may not have been paying much attention this week, but the short version is the end is very near for this terrible turn the Republican Party has taken. The president’s Ukraine scandal is the big one. I get that it can be hard to believe any scandal will stick, but this one is different,” CEO Bill Penzey wrote in a post for his page’s 645,936 followers.

Axios reported that Penzeys spent $92,000 to boost their Facebook posts on impeachment, but over the phone this afternoon, Penzey said it was actually $128,000, which seems like a lot, but is roughly a third of what the company might spend on mailing out its catalogues this month. Penzey founded his namesake company in 1986, and it does most of its business through the mail and a few dozen physical locations.

“I’d sent out an email to our customers the weekend before on the topic, and the response to it was very energized,” Penzey recalled. “And I looked at it and thought, we gotta do a Facebook post about this, because this is something that people are very interested in right now.”

There is some novelty in the largest pro-impeachment ad spend on Facebook being made by the independent spice retailer preferred by my mom, but wading into political waters is not new territory for Penzey. Shortly after Trump’s election, he wrote an email to the Penzeys mailing list criticizing the “open embrace of racism by the Republican Party.”

This move, of openly discussing politics, is conventionally considered bad for business. Taking strong political stances, supposedly, can alienate the fraction of consumers to disagree — nobody wants to feel shamed as they’re buying a jar of lemon-pepper seasoning. Better to do things the old-fashioned way: funding lobbyists and astroturf advocacy groups to push your efforts. Penzey, though, sees things differently. “For all the troubles that people running businesses have to face, I get that — but you know, I think that being neutral is sort of a luxury of the past,” he said. Perhaps the only other company with a consistent track record of relatively radical corporate politics is Ben & Jerry’s, which released the flavor last year, Pecan Resist, “a Limited Batch ice-cream flavor celebrating the activists who are continuing to resist oppression, harmful environmental practices, and injustice.”

There’s plenty of reason to be skeptical of Penzey; countless companies and personalities have built their brands on the backs of partisan resentment and frustration. Plenty of #resistance personalities have spent their time feverishly shitposting their way to book deals. Obviously, Penzey has a business interest in opposing Trump. Many of the spices he sells grow within 10 or 15 degrees of the equator, and he says tariffs have affected how he does business. The spice trade is, now and forever, inherently political.

Penzey’s candor on Facebook about the issues facing the country, however, is complicated in other respects too. He said that three years ago, he also noticed the well-documented change in how posts on Facebook pages performed and the decline of organic reach (reach that isn’t paid for). Now, he says, “pretty much everything you see from a business is an ad.” The cost is reasonable to him, but pages have to pay Facebook to reach their customer base. That means that whenever Penzey wants to talk to his spice customers, he has to effectively buy a political ad.

That process for buying political ads has gotten more and more complicated in the wake of the 2016 election, when Russian operatives infiltrated the platform to “meddle” (a nebulous term often used to describe how foreign entities used social media to try to stoke domestic tensions) in American politics. Now, anyone running an ad “about social issues, elections, or politics” has to prove their identity to Facebook by receiving physical mail. Penzey also suspects that it costs more. In case you were worried, the amount Penzey spent on impeachment ads is in the same ballpark as the amount Russians spent to boost their own posts, and neither is enough on its own to really sway public opinion in a significant way.

“There was never like, ‘oh, let’s do political spending on impeachment ads on Facebook, and let’s see if we can’t beat out everyone but Trump,’” Penzey said. “It was just, you know, our form of communication falls into that category. And then because of how well this post was doing, we kept promoting it for a longer period of time.”

As for the long-term effects, Penzey isn’t worried. He recalled an event a decade and a half ago in which his catalogue showed a same-sex couple with triplets. “The fact that we showed two men as being these caring people being kind to children and caring for each other,” he noted, “that was something that caused 8 percent of our customers to quit us right there.” Most of them eventually returned. There’s something to be said for being on the right side of history."

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg found himself in a bit of a dilemma this week after the Verge published leaked audio of one of the Q&A sessions he regularly holds with employees. To journalists and other Facebookologists, these sessions have a sort of legendary aura around them — in part because Zuckerberg is reportedly very candid in them, and in part because Facebook is generally an extremely leakproof company.

The two-hour recording of a July meeting published by the Verge this week contained Zuckerberg musing on a number issues. He, for instance, called presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren an “existential” threat to Facebook’s existence, given her plan to break up big tech. He described reports of poor working conditions for content moderators to be “overdramatic.” He dished out some light trash talk aimed at Twitter, and pumped up his nascent TikTok competitor, Lasso.

The substance of the comments are, on the whole, unsurprising. Of course Mark Zuckerberg does not think WhatsApp and Instagram should be forcibly separated from Facebook. Of course he thinks Facebook treats its workers well. Of course he thinks Facebook is either doing a good job in all areas or is at least improving. What CEO, particularly a CEO as embattled as Zuckerberg, is going to get up in front of his employees and say, “I’m a big frickin’ bozo and I stink big time”? The point of an all-hands meeting is to project confidence. The only discernible difference between the leaked audio and Zuckerberg’s public statements was the level of polish and candor.

Coincidentally, Zuckerberg is encountering a problem that countless Facebook users (and Facebook designers) have struggled with for years, context collapse. Zuckerberg is addressing one group (his employees), but his remarks are being shown to an unintended audience (the public) and could potentially be taken out of context. Zuckerberg, who often goes to great lengths to maintain his privacy, has the same problem as his users. How do you cater to separate cohorts at once?

Yesterday, Zuckerberg leaned into the leak by livestreaming his weekly all-hands meeting publicly, and addressing the leak at the top of it. Some employees were shocked, he said, but plenty of people also reacted by saying, as Zuckerberg put it, “Fundamentally, we believe everything that we said that was in there.” I should hope!

The resulting livestream is a type of meta display. It’s partly a candid internal meeting, and partly a public performance. Zuckerberg makes jokes about his robotic public appearances (“Where do you go to plug yourself in at night to recharge?” he imagines viewers asking), and he also introduces regular segments of the all-hands meeting, like recognizing smart bug fixes and work anniversaries, as if people are tuning in for the first time ever.

Maybe these broad, performative tics are normal, but I’d have no way of knowing, since Facebook has kept these meetings largely under lock and key. (The company obviously keeps records, since Zuckerberg announced that the leaked meeting was likely one geared to interns.)

Maybe the most interesting part of the talk came when an employee asked Zuckerberg about Bernie Sanders’s recent comments, and a popular left-wing talking point, that billionaires shouldn’t exist. “As the only billionaire that I can consult on this, Mark, what is your perspective on Senator Sanders’s statement?” the employee asked.

I understand where he’s coming from. I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have. But look, I mean, on one level, no one deserves to have that much money. That’s not like — I think if you do something that’s good, you get rewarded, but I do think some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable. Part of this is why my wife and I started the Chan Zuckerberg initiative … Some of this gets to a deeper question. There are people who would say, “Even that’s bad.” It’s like, there shouldn’t be an accumulation of private wealth that allows people to … We’re funding science, for example, and I think some people would say, “Well is it fair that a group of wealthy people, to some degree, get to choose which science projects get worked on?” I don’t know how to answer that exactly. On some level, it’s not fair, but it may be optimal, in that it’s better than the alternative. I think the alternative would be the government chooses all of the funding for all of the stuff.

There’s a little bit of “big government” bogeyman in there, but Zuckerberg clarified that he supports the National Institute of Health; he just wants to use his billions to take a different approach to funding research.

But perhaps more revealing than any of that statement was the worried, deflated whine/moan he let out after receiving the question, knowing that he had to answer it not just in front of his employees, but also anyone who decided to tune in — a very human “aw shit” reaction from a robotic and inhumanly wealthy enigma of a man.

Even if this week’s all-hands is the only one the company streams publicly, it permanently alters how Zuckerberg speaks to his loyal employees. Even in private, he has to keep the idea that anything he says can be made public in mind. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — it forces him to be more consistent, if not necessarily more honest. In other words, if he didn’t know it already (I assume he did), Mark Zuckerberg is always speaking publicly, 24/7.

That tension, that anxiety, has to be exhausting. It is also the core problem of Facebook as a whole, as it has expanded to perform every function that a user might need. Users have a number of different audiences collected under one online identity. Everything you do online feeds back into a single Facebook profile, and that’s how Zuckerberg wants it. Proponents of breaking up Facebook not only think it leads to a healthier overall tech ecosystem, but it could also lead to more authentic behavior from users who don’t have to worry about audience management and what they say being misappropriated elsewhere. Instagram, just this week, released an entirely separate app so that users could talk just to their “close friends.” Just as Zuckerberg might be more comfortable when the press isn’t watching, users might be more comfortable when Facebook isn’t. Just something to think about, imo!"

She wouldn’t commit.

The gainful employment regulations are meant to protect students and taxpayers by withholding federal student aid to career training programs that leave students buried in debt with few opportunities to repay. Asked by Warren if she would enforce the regulations, DeVos said: “We will certainly review that rule, and see if it is actually achieving what the intentions are.”

Warren: “I don’t understand about reviewing it. We talked about this in my office. There are already rules in place to stop waste, fraud and abuse. . . . Swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like this.”"

Roame, who moderated the discussion, did not intervene or ask Fisher to stop.

In the audience, attendees quietly and privately discussed their shared dismay about what they characterized as a pattern of behavior. The backlash did not go public, though, until hours later — in large part because of a summit-wide privacy policy meant to confine the information shared by industry leaders to only those who pay the $25,000 to attend.

At least three attendees refused to stay quiet, willfully violating the summit’s code of conduct to expose Fisher’s behavior with the hope of bringing reform to the wealth management world — which eventually forced Roame to address the matter publicly and Fisher to apologize.

Violating the summit’s media policy was risky, attendees said, particularly in the field of wealth management. A person’s credibility is wholly dependent on their ability to be discreet and keep information private. But those who spoke out said this circumstance warranted an exception.

“I chose to speak out because maintaining a culture of silence around harassment and assault protects those who abuse their power, which then further marginalizes underrepresented groups,” Sonya Dreizler, a speaker and consultant to financial services firms, told The Post.

Dreizler, who specializes in investing that delivers both financial and environmental or social justice returns, came forward after her friend and fellow summit attendee Alex Chalekian shared a video of himself recapping Fisher’s behavior, which he called a “true debacle.”

Chalekian, founder and CEO of Lake Avenue Financial in Pasadena, Calif., said Fisher talked about dropping acid and his belief that charities are immoral. According to Chalekian and other attendees, Fisher also made crude comments about genitalia and mentioned financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges earlier this year before dying by suicide in prison.

“Things that were said by Ken Fisher were just absolutely horrifying,” Chalekian said in the video.

Rachel Robasciotti, founder and CEO of wealth management firm Robasciotti and Philipson in San Francisco, also publicly condemned Fisher’s words “at great personal risk to my career,” she told The Post in an interview.

“If we want things to be different, we have to be different,” Robasciotti said. “And that means not condoning that kind of behavior.""

In the days since the summit, Roame has denounced Fisher’s remarks in a lengthy statement and vowed that the powerful billionaire will never again be invited back to the Tiburon CEO Summit.

“These comments lacked the dignity & respect that should be expected by any Tiburon CEO Summit speaker or attendee,” Roame said. “These were unacceptable words at Tiburon, in the wealth & investments industry, and in society generally.”

Roame also said he “commended” Chalekian for “having the strength to go public.”

Fisher has been forced to respond, too, both apologizing for and defending his words.

AD

In an email to his employees at Fisher Investments that was obtained by Forbes, Fisher was dismissive of criticism from attendees and wrote that Chalekian’s video “mischaracterizes” what he said at the summit.

“It attributes views to me that I neither expressed nor endorsed,” Fisher wrote. “… Many of you are likely familiar with my sometimes colorful means of expressing myself. I like to say whatever is on my mind. I want to you to know I am sincerely sorry if anything I’ve said in your presence offended you. That certainly was never my intention.”

Fisher was more defiant in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg News.

“I have given a lot of talks, a lot of times, in a lot of places and said stuff like this and never gotten that type of response,” Fisher told Bloomberg. “Mostly the audience understands what I am saying.""

On social media, other financial advisers and wealth managers came forward claiming they had heard Fisher make equally crass comments while speaking at previous industry summits.

At one conference in Dana Point, Calif., last year, Fisher said it was “stupid” to brag about financial performance in a direct mailer, according to video of the summit obtained by Bloomberg. Fisher compared that move, according to Bloomberg, to “walking into a bar and you are a single guy and want to get laid and walking up to some girl and saying: ‘Hey you want to have sex?’ You just turn yourself into a jerk.”

When asked what he would have done differently in life, Fisher said he would have “had more sex,” according to the video.

“I wonder if anybody will be candid at one of these Tiburon events again,” he told Bloomberg.

On Thursday, Fisher expressed contrition.

“Some of the words and phrases I used during a recent conference to make certain points were clearly wrong and I shouldn’t have made them. I realize this kind of language has no place in our company or industry,” he said. “I sincerely apologize.”

Robasciotti said her critique of Fisher’s behavior has nothing to do with being candid.

Robasciotti identifies as a queer black woman in an industry overwhelmingly occupied by white men. Fisher’s words, she said, and the message they reinforce are what make it more difficult for people like her to succeed.

“If there aren’t women and people of color in the industry,” she said, “it’s because they don’t feel welcome.”

She is trying to change the work environment from the inside by hiring LGBTQ people, people of color and women and co-founding a social justice investing platform called RISE (Return on Investment and Social Equity), which has partnered with consumer activism and workplace equity groups to tackle the issue of workplace sexual harassment.

The initiative, called Force the Issue, is what she spoke about at the summit — just minutes after Fisher’s keynote address ended. The irony, Robasciotti said, was not lost on her.

“This exact issue was parallel,” she said.

“This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination — but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories,” she wrote Tuesday on Twitter, days after questions about that claim surfaced.

The quick backstory: A reporter for the socialist Jacobin magazine raised the specter of doubt about Warren’s claims in a tweet last week. Then on Monday, the conservative Washington Free Beacon reported that documents show that the school board in New Jersey where Warren worked had approved a second-year teaching contract for her, thus supposedly contradicting her claims that she was asked not to return to teaching because of her pregnancy. Political adversaries have circulated a newly surfaced video of Warren saying she left public school teaching after taking a few graduate school courses and determining that teaching was not “going to work out” for her.

Conservatives on outlets such as Fox News have compared the inconsistency to Warren’s past claims that she had Native American ancestry, which eventually led to her apologizing last year to multiple tribes after recognizing that they determine their membership, not DNA tests.

However, the attention critics are paying to this story has led some people to view it as an attempt to smear the leading woman in the 2020 campaign in ways that seem similar to the conservative media’s coverage of Hillary Clinton in 2016. For them, not only is Warren’s story to be believed but so are all of the other stories from women about a workplace discrimination issue that has gotten too little attention: employment insecurity for expectant mothers.

Joshua Zeitz, a historian and author, wrote a thread of tweets describing a long history of discrimination against pregnant women across multiple industries, leading to the need for legislation to address the issue.

“To believe Warren is lying, one need be blind to the history of discrimination in ‘pink collar’ professions like teaching where pregnancy was a fireable offense, so much so that Congress passed Title VII in 1978 to outlaw the practice of dismissing pregnant professionals,” he tweeted. “Teachers arguably had it good: in some professions — notably, flight attendants — airlines imposed strict age caps and prohibited married women from holding their jobs. These practices persisted into the 1960s and 1970s.”

The type of discrimination Warren claims she experienced in the 1970s existed across socioeconomic classes, although it manifested in different ways, said Joan C. Williams, founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law, an advocacy organization at the University of California Hastings College of the Law that focuses on gender equity issues in the workplace.

“Among low-wage women, the classic form of discrimination based on family responsibility was that a woman tells her boss she’s pregnant and the woman is fired 15 minutes later,” Williams said. “For white-collar women, the classic form of discrimination is not typically just for getting pregnant. The problems they encountered typically are triggered after they come back to work — promotions are stalled.”

Perhaps most notable is how differently pregnant mothers are treated from fathers. In 2014, Michelle Budig, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts, wrote “The Fatherhood Bonus and the Motherhood Penalty: Parenthood and the Gender Gap in Pay,” a paper about how women are discriminated against in the workplace when they become mothers. Budig argues that the wage gap between men and women exists in part because women are discriminated against when they enter parenthood.

“While the average penalty for all women in the full model is about 4% per child, the penalty ranges in size from 6% per child among low-wage workers to no penalty among the earners at the 90th percentile or above,” she wrote.

“Might employer discrimination lie behind the motherhood penalty that is unexplained by measurable characteristics of workers and jobs?” Budig wrote. “It is difficult to obtain data on discrimination. However, evidence from experimental and audit studies support arguments of employer discrimination against mothers in callbacks for job applications, hiring decisions, wage offers, and promotions.”

A Harvard Kennedy School study found the recommended starting salary for mothers was 8.6 percent lower than the recommended salary for fathers. Williams suggested that women are financially punished when they become parents, unlike fathers, who are celebrated.

“Being a father actually enhances a man’s career prospects while it sharply hurts women,” she told The Fix. “And for single women, they often trigger the modern pathetic-spinster stereotype — someone who is lacking and not quite whole because they haven’t fulfilled the biological destiny of women.”

There has been significant improvement since the 1970s as a result of legislation such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and data revealing just how different the experiences of pregnant women are in the workplace, Williams said. However, some companies have found less direct ways to treat pregnant women differently. Her center produced a report titled “Poor, Pregnant, and Fired: Caregiver Discrimination Against Low-Wage Workers,” sharing the experiences of working women.

“The discrimination is a lot less open than it was,” Williams said. “It has not disappeared, and it will not disappear until we stop defining the ideal worker as someone who takes no time off for child-rearing and childbearing.”

For many women following the issue, Warren’s experience reminds them of their own stories and the ways the issue persists.

She looked slippery as she tried to avoid talking about funding (who pays and how much do they pay) for Medicare-for-all. She got to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on pulling “all troops out of the Middle East,” although her spokesperson tried walking that back after the debate.

And speaking of Sanders, who returned from his recent heart attack, his energetic debate performance and his campaign’s most genuinely emotional moment (thanking well-wishers) demonstrated he is still a force to be reckoned with. He managed to deliver a rare snub to Warren by agreeing the candidates should be honest about taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all.

Sanders also got an additional boost when Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) decided to endorse him and appeared along with Michael Moore at Sanders’s massive rally (a new campaign record of 26,000) in New York on Saturday. (After previous massive crowds, a Warren event at a half-filled smaller venue attracted notice, putting additional pressure on her advance team to keep crowd size up.) One could argue that in the general election, Warren is better off without the boosterism of the furthest-left House members, but it does set back her effort to solidify support among the most progressive Democratic primary voters.

Indeed, the Sanders resurgence and support from half of the Squad carries a reminder that Warren was never going to out-Bernie Bernie. As he said, she’s a capitalist; he is a socialist. She cares if her policy initiatives are politically plausible; he does not. One wonders, then, if it was all that wise for her to bind herself so tightly to Medicare-for-all. Granted she did not want to leave a lot of room on her left, but her effort to adhere so closely to Sanders’s unworkable and politically problematic Medicare-for-all comes with a price (not just the $30-plus trillion it will cost).

This is in no way shape or form a prediction of her demise. She has plenty of room to finesse Medicare-for-all. The uber-progressive former Harvard Law professor has convinced many Democrats that she is an Okie and the compromise candidate between the center-left and far-left. Like South Bend Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, her quick wit and agile mind helps her run rhetorical circles around many opponents.

No, the import last week’s events is not that she is done for or in trouble but that no one including Warren has a lock or even substantial advantage in the Democratic primary. There are a handful of candidates with a plausible path to the nomination, of which Warren is one but, as we witnessed last week, certainly not the only one.
