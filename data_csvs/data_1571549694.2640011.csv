That's no small detail.,2019-09-20,MSNBC,Revelations bring Trump's whistleblower scandal into sharper focus,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/revelations-bring-trumps-whistleblower-scandal-sharper-focus,"There are still some key elements of the whistleblower scandal that are not yet publicly available, but after reading the Washington Post’s overnight scoop, the story is quickly coming into sharper focus.

A whistleblower complaint about President Trump made by an intelligence official centers on Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter, which has set off a struggle between Congress and the executive branch. The complaint involved communications with a foreign leader and a “promise” that Trump made, which was so alarming that a U.S. intelligence official who had worked at the White House went to the inspector general of the intelligence community, two former U.S. officials said. Two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and political newcomer who was elected in a landslide in May.

The New York Times also reported that the story involves Trump and Ukraine.

And if you’ve been following the news closely over the last few weeks, this doesn’t necessarily come as a major surprise. Trump, putting aside the Pentagon’s guidance, recently held off on delivering promised military aid to Ukraine, and according to the Washington Post, it’s because the American president hoped to leverage the aid as part of an extortion scheme: Trump reportedly told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that if his country wanted the military assistance, his country would have to assist the Trump campaign by investigating Joe Biden.

If you’re wondering why in the world Ukraine would have anything to do with the 2020 race in the United States in the first place, the New York Times published a curious article in May, raising questions about Joe Biden’s work several years ago on a government-reform effort in Ukraine. There was some suggestion that the Delaware Democrat’s son may have benefited, but the claims of possible wrongdoing quickly unraveled, and the story went largely overlooked.

Trump and his team, however, believe that if they dig hard enough on this, there may be some dirt they could use.

It’s against this backdrop that Trump reportedly made a “promise” that centered on Ukraine that was so provocative that a U.S. intelligence official filed a complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community.

The Trump administration is now hiding that complaint from Congress, defying legal disclosure requirements.

To be sure, none of the latest reporting on the scandal has directly linked Trump’s controversial “promise” and his purported efforts to shake down the new Ukrainian president, but to understand the context of the developments, it’s important to keep both stories in mind.

Alas, that’s not the only angle of note in this fast-breaking story. As Rachel explained on the show last night, Trump’s Justice Department, for reasons unknown, has been brought into the process and is arguing that the whistleblower complaint isn’t a real whistleblower complaint, so the administration is justified in ignoring disclosure laws.

What’s more, CNN has reported that the White House itself is involved in the handling of the whistleblower complaint, which seems inherently indefensible, since the complaint directly implicates the president.

For his or her part, the whistleblower has hired a powerhouse attorney who specializes in whistleblower protections, which was probably a good idea given the possibility of reprisals against the person who filed the complaint related to Trump’s alleged misconduct.

* New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ended his Democratic presidential campaign this morning, explaining on MSNBC, “I feel like I have contributed all I can to this primary election. It’s clearly not my time.” There are still 19 candidates vying for the party’s nomination.

* Joe Biden’s presidential campaign picked up three notable congressional endorsements yesterday, receiving support from Reps. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), and Charlie Crist (D-Fla.). Both Cleaver and Butterfield have served as chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus.

* Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign announced an impressive milestone yesterday: the Vermont senator became the first 2020 candidate to reach 1 million individual donors. Then-candidate Barack Obama also topped the million-donor mark in his 2008 race, but Sanders reached the threshold even faster.

* There’s been increased speculation in recent weeks about whether Rep. Lucy McBath (D) would run in one of Georgia’s two U.S. Senate races next year, but the first-term lawmaker announced yesterday that she would instead run for re-election to her U.S. House seat.

* The latest Monmouth University poll in New Jersey shows Sen. Cory Booker (D) popular in his home state, but that’s not translating into strong support for his presidential campaign. Biden leads the Democratic field in the Garden State with 26%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 20%, and Sanders at 18%. Booker is fourth in New Jersey with 9%.

* A notable tidbit from this week’s Fox News poll: it not only shows Donald Trump trailing each of the top Democratic contenders in hypothetical general election match-ups, it also shows Democrats with an enthusiasm edge over Republicans.

* And in New Hampshire, where Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, appears to be gearing up for a U.S. Senate race, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced yesterday that he’s supporting former state House Speaker Bill O’Brien for the GOP nomination. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D), meanwhile, is generally seen as the favorite to win re-election."

Take last night, for example.

Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal lawyers, was interviewed by CNN’s Chris Cuomo, and the host asked Giuliani whether he asked Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. “No,” the Republican replied. “Actually, I didn’t.”

About 30 seconds later, viewers were treated to this exchange:

CUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? GIULIANI: Of course, I did. CUOMO: You just said you didn’t. GIULIANI: No. I didn’t ask them to look into Joe Biden.

It actually went downhill from there.

To be sure, watching Giuliani’s apparent meltdown on national television was difficult. If he thought he was representing his client’s interests, the former mayor was mistaken.

But this was about more than just a former prominent politician embarrassing himself on camera. There’s actually a real story here, which may relate to the ongoing scandal about the intelligence community whistleblower.

As regular readers may recall, the New York Times published a curious article in May, raising questions about Biden’s work several years ago on a government-reform effort in Ukraine. There was some suggestion that the Delaware Democrat’s son may have benefited, but the claims of possible wrongdoing quickly unraveled, and the story went largely overlooked.

There was, however, a lingering question about what – or more accurately, who – was helping drive the story in the first place. The details were a little convoluted, but the Times’ article made clear that it was Rudy Giuliani who was helping lead an effort to get Ukrainian assistance for Donald Trump’s political agenda. (At one point, the story noted, “Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Trump excitedly to brief him on his findings.”)

According to the reporting, Giuliani was encouraging Ukraine to launch investigations intended to help Trump’s re-election campaign. It was a rather striking revelation in its own right: one of the American president’s lawyers appeared to be pressuring a foreign government to assist with a political scheme intended to help the American president stay in power.

Giuliani didn’t exactly deny the scheme at the time, saying, “There’s nothing illegal about it. Somebody could say it’s improper.”

Four months later, Giuliani was interviewed on CNN and appeared to say he did, in fact, ask Ukraine to investigate Biden.

In case this isn’t painfully obvious, at the heart of the Russia scandal was a foreign government’s intervention in an American political campaign during the 2016 cycle. Ahead of the 2020 cycle, Donald Trump’s lawyer apparently had the bright idea of turning to a different foreign government – which is eager to be in the United States’ good graces – hoping it too might help influence the direction of an American campaign.

And it’s against this backdrop that there’s a complaint from a U.S. intelligence community whistleblower, who filed a credible complaint accusing Trump of making an allegedly improper “promise” in a scandal involving Ukraine."

Trump’s call is reportedly the source of a complaint by a whistleblower against the president that has sparked a furor among Democrats in Congress, who are demanding to see the complaint.

If, as multiple news organizations are reporting, the whistleblower’s complaint centers on Ukraine, there is strong evidence that it relates to President Trump’s urging the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

The story behind that story is itself worthy of serious scrutiny.

The proposed investigation involves Hunter Biden’s involvement with a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company while then-Vice President Biden was overseeing America’s Ukraine policy.

Critics of the president have accused Trump of attempting to “extort” Ukrainian officials for “dirt” on Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year.

But why would Ukraine have dirt on Joe Biden? For answers, one must look at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company which, until earlier this year, employed Hunter Biden.

In April 2014, Hunter Biden agreed to join Burisma’s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues, The New Yorker reported. Biden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help.

Earlier that month, British officials had frozen the London bank accounts of Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own corruption investigation into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported.

Hunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, The New York Times reported.

The younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma.

Hunter Biden claims he had no role in the investigation of the company, and that he never spoke about it with his father – but the facts show a troubling overlap with the Obama administration’s actions in Ukraine.

On April 16, 2014, White House records show that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s business partner, made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Biden. Five days later, on April 21, Joe Biden landed in Kiev for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials.

Soon the United States and the International Monetary Fund would be pumping more than $1 billion into the Ukrainian economy, as I wrote in the New York Post.

The next day, there was a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, on May 13, it was officially announced that Hunter Biden would join, too. Like Hunter Biden, Archer had no background or experience in the energy sector.

In March 2016, Ukrainian officials fired Viktor Shokin, the controversial prosecutor general whose office was overseeing the investigation into Burisma, The New York Times reported.

Six months later, the Burisma case was dropped entirely, the Kyiv Post reported.

According to Joe Biden himself, the former vice president played a key role in the prosecutor’s dismissal.

In March 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if Shokin was not fired, according to Biden, who recounted the exchange in a 2018 speech: “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b----. He got fired.”

While the propriety of Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president is certainly questionable and worthy of inquiry, the investigation he was hoping for certainly seems warranted on its own merits.

Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing of Thomas and the committee heard testimony from Thomas and Hill. Biden has repeatedly claimed that he believed Hill from the very beginning and that he did everything in his power to keep Thomas from being confirmed.

'SPECIAL INTERESTS' WANTS TO TARNISH KAVANAUGH, AS THEY DID THOMAS: CLARENCE THOMAS ADVISER

However, Biden's account is challenged in the Fox Nation documentary 'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching' and now Fox Nation is releasing previously-unseen interviews elaborating on these claims.

In 'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching', former Senator Orrin Hatch R-Utah, who sat on the 1991 Judiciary committee with Biden, told Fox Nation that Biden told him during the hearings that he 'didn’t believe [Hill].'""

Longtime Thomas adviser and radio host, Armstrong Williams told Fox Nation that ""Biden assured [Thomas], repeatedly on the phone and in person, 'Clarence, you will be confirmed.'""

Now, in new interview material, Williams said ""Joe Biden wanted to vote for Thomas – remember. Joe Biden is getting grief right now because [of the way] they say he treated Anita Hill...by and large, the Southern Senators and Biden liked Thomas.""

Thomas' nomination was eventually confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48. Biden voted against sending Thomas to the Supreme Court.

“Biden was always confidentially talking to Thomas saying ‘I’m with you. I’m with you.’ That’s something that people don’t know. Biden was very much encouraging him, behind the scenes. Telling him to hang in there...Behind the scenes, no one could have been more gracious than Biden,"" Williams continued.

WOULD IT GO VIRAL TODAY? EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY IN THOMAS/HILL SAGA: NEW DOC

Biden's handling of the hearings has long been a point of contention for his critics, who fault Biden for not allowing more witnesses, supportive of Hill, to testify.

In March, Biden lamented his apparent inability to provide a different forum for Hill to air her allegations.

""To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to give her the kind of hearing she deserved,"" Biden said at a New York City event honoring young people who helped combat sexual assault on college campuses. ""I wish I could have done something.""

According to Williams, Biden pro-actively prevented witnesses from making allegations that Biden deemed unfounded. ""Well, there were people that wanted to testify, who had no credibility, that the other side was pushing for -- Biden never allowed them on the docket.""

“I have a lot of respect for Biden. I've always found Biden to be fair, compassionate and really could read the tea leaves of where things are going, because he did let [Thomas and me] know 'This is not going well. But I am not going to allow what is garbage and unproven accusations...to make it into this hearing'. I mean – there were his colleagues, who were angry with him about it, but Biden was a stand-up kind of guy. I know conservatives are not going to like it, but as far as I'm concerned Biden was always decent,"" said Williams.

Williams also acknowledged that his account may not be politically-advantageous to Biden. “I had no issue with Biden during that process. Biden did all he could – this may not help him on-camera – Biden did all he could to be fair to Judge Thomas at the time. He could not have been more gracious and more communicative with the Justice at the time, and he apologized profusely. He felt so bad [about] what was happening to him and these allegations.”

The incident occurred at the ""LGBTQ Presidential Forum"" hosted by GLAAD and the Iowa Gazette on Friday. One of the Gazette's writers, Lyz Lenz, seemed to question Biden's progressive bona fides when she asked about his opposition to the ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" policy and a compliment he paid to Vice President Mike Pence.

""You have also praised Vice President Mike Pence as a decent guy,"" Lenz said, drawing boos from the crowd. ""You're a lovely person,"" Biden shot back with a smile on his face.

Lenz defended herself, saying that she was just ""asking the questions that people want to know."" According to some, like Time Magazine editor Anand Giridharadas, Biden's response was related to the moderator's gender.

""Last week, Joe Biden gave us an occasion to talk about 'racism with a smile.' Now he’s doing 'sexism with a smile.' Watch him grow angry at @lyzl's solid question -- and then try to slap her down in the most patronizing way,"" Giridharadas tweeted on Saturday.

Jamil Smith, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, similarly accused Biden of ""Paleolithic behavior."" ""I admire Lyz’s professionalism in this moment,"" he tweeted.

""Sad that it was even necessary. Biden keeps exhibiting this kind of Paleolithic behavior, and too many folks will excuse it because they’re used to seeing their male elders act like way. There is no such thing as benevolent sexism.""

Others piled on with critical tweets on Saturday. After the exchange on Friday, Lenz hinted that Biden continued his sarcasm as she walked off the stage.

""As I was walking off the stage with @JoeBiden he said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart,'"" she tweeted.

Stoddard said that the reason older African-Americans support the former vice president is that “they are afraid” and want to beat President Trump.

Biden has been considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination since before he even entered the race. However, while he currently still leads the field, his support has been diminishing, according to a new Fox News Poll.

Biden has the support of 29 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to the poll. That figure is down from 31 percent in August and 35 percent in May. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June."

First, our constitutional system is based on friction between competing branches vested with separate but closely related powers. The framers understood that the two political branches would periodically try to usurp each other’s authorities. Congress often does this by enactments that seek to subject executive power to congressional (or judicial) supervision. Presidential pushback on such laws is not criminal obstruction; it is the Constitution in action.

Second, we’ve become so law-obsessed that we miss the forest for the trees. Often, the least important aspect of a controversy — viz., whether a law has been violated — becomes the dominant consideration. Short shrift is given to the more consequential aspects, such as whether we are being competently governed or whether power is being abused.

These problems are now playing out in the Trump controversy du jour (or should I say de l’heure?): the intelligence community whistleblower.

As this column is written on Friday afternoon, the story is still evolving, with the president tweeting as ever, and The New York Times producing a report by no fewer than eight of its top journalists, joining the seven (and counting) who are working it for the Washington Post, which broke the story.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden.

Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his role as VP in pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as vice president, worked to protect the company from investigation.

On Saturday, Biden said that he had never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings in Ukraine, and backed calls for the House to investigate -- as well as suggesting it could begin a path to impeachment.

“Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached but I’m not making that judgment now,” he said. “The House should investigate it, this appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.”

He went on to call Trump a “serial abuser.”

“He abuses power everywhere he can and if he sees any threat to staying in power, he’ll do whatever he has to do -- but this crosses the line,” he said.

CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT

Biden’s remarks came just hours after Trump dismissed the controversy as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt” being stoked by the Democratic Party and the “fake news media,” and said that the real scandal was to do with Biden’s interactions in the country.

“The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,” he tweeted.

“Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!”

What initially touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader.

Trump dismissed the story as “ridiculous"" and a ""partisan hack job"" from the Oval Office on Friday and said his calls with foreign leaders are “always appropriate.”

The whistleblower complaint led House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democrats to call for an investigation and for the administration hand over the complaint as well as a transcript of the call -- even as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to share details with lawmakers.

Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

On Saturday Trump said that the media was turning the story into one about him, as they are trying to “protect” the Democratic frontrunner.

“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” he tweeted. “Will fail again!”

Biden, his two leading competitors in the Democratic presidential primaries and President Trump are all in their 70s. The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70.

Are all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet?

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE

Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind.

But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents.

Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A Fox News poll that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May.

Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president.

But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House.

So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier.

But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia?

Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less.

And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget.

And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own.

More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker database, as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.”

“President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported.

Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.”

But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.”

We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes.

And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond.

Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people.

But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes.

Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their

children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire.

Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year. An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012.

And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said.

According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.”

I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong.

And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia.

The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners.

My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.

CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT

Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2020, faced scrutiny for months over accusations that he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at that time was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Biden's son.

Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump, has suggested that Biden worked to protect the company from investigation while in office. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility.

The issue involving the Bidens resurfaced Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine.

Schweizer implied Hunter Biden's credentials didn't match with the position he held, and that the situation looked suspicious.

""He is supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is, What is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise, he has none,"" Schweizer said. ""His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine.""

Meanwhile, after Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call, while 2020 hopefuls renewed calls for impeachment.

CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.

Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation.

In a lengthy statement Friday evening, Biden said that if the reports were true ""there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.

""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" Biden continued. ""It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor ...""

""At minimum,"" Biden concluded, ""Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress.""

What initially touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports.

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM

Trump called that initial story “ridiculous” in the Oval Office, and said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine.

""I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,"" Trump said. ""At the highest level, always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.""

Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers.

“President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" the statement said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers.""

After the publication of the Journal’s story, 2020 Democrats quickly weighed in. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said that Trump “is a criminal.”

“He must be impeached immediately,” he said.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump “appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America’s democracy” before she urged the whistleblower to come forward.

“I would absolutely urge this whistleblower to go directly to Congress, whether in closed session or in open session,” she said.

Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation.""

""Come hell or high water, that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Democrats have been looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate the Biden activities, and have also sought a transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky.

The inspector general for the intelligence community received the whistleblower complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it.

In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision.""

Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

The U.N.'s official schedule says Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 16 other world leaders will attend a General Assembly meeting Tuesday. NBC News White House correspondent Kelly O’Donnell tweeted Friday that the White House confirmed Trump will meet with Zelensky on Wednesday.

It wasn't immediately clear if the second gathering would be a one-on-one meeting.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

Zelensky will also take meetings with leaders of the Ukrainian community in the U.S., leaders of Jewish organizations based in the U.S. and representatives of the American business community, O’Donnell reported. He will also attend the Sustainable Development Summit.

A senior White House official told Axios that Trump will meet with Zelensky to congratulate him on his victory in the eastern European nation’s recent presidential election and his “energy and success"" in battling corruption. The official said Trump will also voice ""his concerns about predatory Chinese economic activity in Ukraine."" Trump’s itinerary also says he’ll meet with the leaders of Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, the U.K., India, Iraq and El Salvador, Axios reported.

Trump will also host a summit Monday on religious freedom. His speech will present the U.S. as an alternative to authoritarianism and underline his ""commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedom,"" administration officials said Friday during a briefing call, according to Axios. Trump will not attend a U.N. meeting that same day that’s slated to focus on climate change.

A secret whistleblower filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, on Aug. 12, detailing a ""promise"" Trump reportedly made to an unnamed foreign leader. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire so far has withheld the complaint from Congress. The Washington Post and the New York Times both reported Thursday that the complaint involved Ukraine.

Cory Booker’s presidential campaign manager is warning in a memo to staff that the Democratic senator from New Jersey must raise an additional $1.7 million by the end of the third quarter of fundraising – just 10 days away – or the campaign will not have a “legitimate long-term path forward.”

In the memo, campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned that following a weaker than expected cash haul during the early part of September, “the next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race.""

BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL'

The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources.

Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.

And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.”

Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Demissie warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand.

Demissie explained in his memo ""If our campaign is not in a financial position to grow, he’s not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone's first priority.”

While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he’s struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits, far behind top-tier contenders former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

“In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement, adding: ""It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.""

SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY

Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies.

Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use ""public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores.""

The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices.

BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM'

Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost. According to Reuters, the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released.

During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.”

Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President Joe Biden has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option.

Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free.

As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.”"

What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports.

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM

Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ""promise"" from Trump entailed.

The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the president blasted the “ridiculous” story, blaming a “partisan whistleblower” and calling it “just another political hack job.”

“I don’t know the identity of the whistleblower,” Trump said.

He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine.

He also argued the press has had “a bad week,” insisting he has prevailed in controversies reported by the media.

“I guess I’m about 22 and 0, and I’ll keep it that way,” the president said.

Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint.

“President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" they said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers.""

Earlier Friday, Trump sounded off on Twitter, accusing Schiff of joining with the media to go after him once again.

“The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!” the president tweeted Friday. “They think I may have had a ‘dicey’ conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a ‘highly partisan’ whistleblowers statement.”

He added: “Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!”

For his part, Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation.""

""Come hell or high water that’s what we’re going to do,” he said.

Meanwhile, allies of the president took to the airwaves to downplay the story

""This is a clear example of someone from the deep state ... from the intelligence community,"" former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Fox News’ ""The Story with Martha MacCallum."" ""It was completely overblown. ... It will be a big nothing burger.""

Fueling intrigue, Giuliani has raised questions about the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into that company.

During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. Giuliani initially said, ""No, actually I didn't,"" but seconds later he said, ""Of course I did.""

He explained that he sought for the government to look into how the case was dismissed.

Later, Giuliani tweeted, ""A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.""

MATTHEW WHITAKER CALLS REPORTED WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT A 'CLEAR EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE FROM THE DEEP STATE'

The whistleblower complaint has triggered a major showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. The inspector general for the intelligence community received the complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.”

But the watchdog reported to the committee that his office is “at an impasse” with the director of national intelligence over the disclosure. Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it.

After a closed-door hearing Thursday with Atkinson, Schiff voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage. ""What’s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,"" he said.

Schiff had subpoenaed Maguire saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision.""

Schiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back ""raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct.""

Following Thursday’s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., took a veiled shot at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in Iowa Saturday for not moving to impeach President Trump, suggesting that Pelosi's inaction enabled Trump to continue seeking foreign assistance in elections.

""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice. I read all 448 pages and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump,"" Warren said at the Polk County Democratic Party's Steak Fry fundraiser, referring to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she added.

Her comments followed reports that the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into corruption accusations surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

While many Democrats called for impeachment after the report surfaced, Pelosi reportedly has continued to oppose the ramping-up of impeachment proceedings.

Warren, a 2020 hopeful, was just one of several to condemn Pelosi's inaction on the issue. ""This is absolutely insane,"" Jon Favreau, who previously served in the Obama administration, tweeted.

""We have lifelong conservatives writing pieces about how Trump should be impeached and @SpeakerPelosi ’s advisers are still telling reporters they refuse to hold the President accountable.""

Favreau was responding a tweet by CNBC's John Harwood, which claimed that one of Pelosi's advisers put the kibosh on impeachment. Actress Debra Messing was similarly outraged, calling Pelosi's reluctance ""INSANITY.""

""I am so infuriated at the Dem Leadership. What the f--k has to happen before doing the RIGHT THING is the GUIDING PRINCIPLE. This is destroying our country AND our party. Waiting for permission from the GOP to act is pure COWARDICE and DERELICTION OF DUTY. ACT!!"" she tweeted on Saturday."

THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION

How corrupt do you think your government is?



According to Transparency International, which has been ranking countries on its 1-100 scale for 25 years, the United States is not very corrupt at all.



The most recent rankings, built through a survey of experts and businesspeople, ranks the U.S. as 22nd cleanest in the 180 nations of the world. We run in a pack with other mostly Western liberal democracies like Australia, Britain and France just behind the squeaky clean Scandinavian nations and, of course, Canada.



We are far removed from the rampant corruption under which most of the rest of the world is forced to live. Russia, China, India and Brazil are all bad news when it comes to basic principles of fairness. All of Africa except for Botswana and every Asian nation except Japan are considered substantially corrupt.



So your government, on an empirical basis, is pretty much on the level.



But that’s not the important question. What matters is how corrupt do you think your government is. And on that score, the news is bad.



In our most recent Fox News poll, we asked respondents “How many people in the government do you think are corrupt -- almost all, many, some, or almost none?” The results should be sobering for everyone concerned about the current trajectory of politics.



About one in five said that almost all of the people in government are corrupt. An amazing 43 percent said that “many” are crooked. Just 31 percent got closer to reality saying that “some” in the government are corrupt. A sad 2 percent said “almost none.”



As with all reputational goods, like a nation’s currency, the perception of value is far more important than the actual value itself. If a government is perceived as corrupt it’s almost as bad as the real thing, and will eventually result in real corruption anyway.



If you think the game is rigged, you’re far more likely to be willing to cheat yourself.



The 64 percent of Americans who believe their government is rotten with corruption don’t belong to any particular demographic or political group, either. Women are a little more distrustful than men and white people are more dubious than other ethnic groups, whites without college degrees most of all.



But religious faith, political proclivities, education and income all had relatively little bearing on the overall perception that corruption is a major problem in our government.



It’s no wonder, given what both political parties are selling these days. It would be one thing if the response was really about “draining the swamp” and some sustained effort for reforms that might bring public perception back into alignment with reality. But what tends to happen is that politicians exploit such perceptions to create lower expectations for good government and accountability once they are in power.



If the whole system is rigged, why should our side have to play by the rules? After all they’re the real crooks



That’s how the false perception of rampant corruption makes way for the real thing.



THE RULEBOOK: THERE’S A DIFFERENCE

“It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 14



TIME OUT: SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA

Gun&Garden: “When Ken Burns decides to cover a topic, set aside some time to dig in. Best known for his epics, including his Civil War documentary, which aired on PBS over five nights in 1990 to an audience of 40 million people, the filmmaker is now readying for the premiere his latest deep-dive, Country Music. The eight-part, sixteen-hour film takes a magnifying glass to the forces that shaped this distinctly American sound. ‘I’m looking for stories, and I’m looking for stories that are firing on all cylinders,’ Burns tells Garden & Gun. … The film runs chronologically, tracing the many influences that shaped country music, from enslaved people bringing the banjo across the Atlantic from Africa all the way to the heyday of pop-country in the mid-1990s. The genre, Burns reveals, is less a set of rules and boundaries than it is a spectrum—one that trades on universal truths and bridges cultural, racial, and economic divides.”

BIDEN RACKS UP KEY ENDORSEMENTS

AP: “Joe Biden sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Charlie Crist of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress. The moves are the latest example of Biden’s durability as an early Democratic front-runner. So far, he’s successfully threaded different wings of the party despite skepticism from progressives and questions about whether, at 76, he’s too old for the presidency. … [T]he support of Butterfield and Cleaver in particular is a potential blow to Sen. Kamala Harris [and] Sen. Cory Booker…”



Younger black voters try to pry their parents from Biden - NYT: “If Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters… But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage. Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged.”



Harris takes aim at Warren - WSJ: “Ka­mala Har­ris, now a dis­tant fourth in the De­mo­c­ra­tic pres­i­den­tial race, took aim at poll-climber Eliz­a­beth War­ren for do­ing big-money events. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about War­ren, Har­ris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hyp­o­crit­i­cal for her ri­val to claim she wasn’t tak­ing money from large donors when War­ren trans­ferred around $10 mil­lion from her Sen­ate funds be­fore de­nounc­ing big money do­na­tions. Har­ris moved $1.2 mil­lion into her pres­i­den­tial fund. Har­ris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the cam­paign fi­nan­cially afloat but prefers to spend time in early vot­ing states. On a later press call, Har­ris’s cam­paign didn’t name War­ren di­rectly but noted re­peat­edly that Har­ris came into the cam­paign with less than other can­di­dates be­cause ‘we spent 2018 rais­ing for other can­di­dates.’”



And same with Buttigieg - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is accusing his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren of being ‘extremely evasive’ when it comes to explaining how she'd finance a universal health care plan. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Buttigieg issued his most pointed attack yet on the Massachusetts senator, saying she ‘was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly.’ The sharpened critique comes as the fall campaign kicks into high gear with Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses scheduled in February. Warren has assembled a well-organized campaign there and leads Buttigieg in Iowa, where the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's longshot presidential campaign is competing heavily and trying to break through.”



Yang plays Perot for a new generation - Atlantic: “To understand why [Andrew Yang is hanging on in the polls], it’s worth looking at how he responded earlier this month when Shane Gillis, a comedian for Saturday Night Live, referred to him using a racial slur. Yang urged that Gillis not be fired. … But more revealing was Yang’s explanation for why Gillis deserved forgiveness. Gillis, Yang tweeted, ‘does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.’ What does central Pennsylvania have to do with it? For Andrew Yang and his supporters, everything. It’s code for economic distress—which Yang believes fuels racism and most of the other problems that menace America. … Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was Ross Perot. The second is Andrew Yang.”



De Blasiout - Fox News: “New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race. ‘I feel like I contributed all I can to this primary election and it’s clearly not my time,’ he said during an appearance on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ ‘So I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.’ De Blasio entered the presidential race in May, running as a proud progressive. But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.”



Booker hides from past alliance with DeVos - WaPo: “Cory Booker was a little-known member of the Newark City Council 19 years ago when he received an extraordinary invitation from a Michigan group connected to Betsy DeVos, now the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos and her husband, Dick, were leading Republican proponents of a state ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-financed vouchers to pay for private schools. … Booker accepted. … But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.”



UKRAINE AT CENTER OF FIGHT OVER ALLEGED TRUMP PROMISE

Fox News: “The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation President Trump had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ‘partisan’ plot against him. What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ‘promise’ Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ‘promise’ from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.”



Giuliani inconsistent - WaPo: “Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night. Immediately after anchor Chris Cuomo introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode. … Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son Hunter was on the board. …There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.”



TRUMP RALLIES WITH MODI IN OUTREACH TO KEY VOTER BLOC

WaPo: “President Trump heads to Harris County, Texas this weekend to a major rally ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly — for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The website for the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally boasts that the ‘live audience will be the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope’: Some 50,000 people, many from Houston's large Indian diaspora, are expected to turn out. It's eye-popping that leaders of the world's two biggest democracies are appearing together at such an event — let alone that this particular American president will be holding court in the epicenter of Texas's blue wave and the most diverse city in America. You're not wrong if you think that doesn't sound like friendly territory for Trump. But that's a strong political reason for him to go: Democrats are making a big play for Texas in 2020 and Republicans are growing concerned. The rally for Modi, who is hugely popular in India, provides Trump with access to a potential pool of Indian American voters that could turn out to be critical in next year's presidential elections.”



SENATE DEMS NEED BIG WINS IN THE SUN BELT

Politico: “To take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president’s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt. From Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber. President Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states — if not victories — to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states — not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.”



Kemp frustrates GOP with cattle call for Senate appointment - AJC: “Within hours of Gov. Brian Kemp’s unusual decision to invite the public to apply to succeed U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, his office was blitzed with resumes — some serious and some silly — from wannabe Washingtonians.Lawyers. Doctors. Local government officials. Serial jokesters. IT specialists. A well-known pundit. As of Wednesday evening, 158 people had applied — and many, many more are expected to join in. … Welcome to the next phase of the race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Chances are, Kemp and his advisers already have whittled a list of top contenders for Isakson’s seat down to a handful — and that the online application process unveiled late Tuesday will be largely for show. But encouraging would-be U.S. senators to publicly declare their ambition might just expand the scope of his search even as it forces some tough decisions on potential contenders.”

YOU STAY CLASSY, CALEB BENNETT

WFTS: “A freak boating accident left a 14-year-old Manatee County boy with an anchor lodged in his skull, and doctors call his survival story ‘one in a million.’ ‘I can’t believe I had an anchor in my head. Like, that’s pretty crazy,’ Caleb Bennett said. ‘My friends now call me the ‘Anchorman’ so that’s kind of cool. I’m kind of a big deal around here.’ Caleb and his family love to fish on the Manatee River, and that's exactly what the teenager was doing when the accident happened. His parents, Kelli and Rick Bennett, were in the Bahamas celebrating their wedding anniversary when they got the call. … Caleb told the Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital he remembered feeling the anchor and thinking he just needed to stay calm. … Caleb was flown to Johns Hopkins in St. Petersburg where he immediately underwent brain surgery. … [Luis Rodriguez, M.D., a pediatric neurological surgeon at Johns Hopkins] told the family how lucky it was that the anchor didn't touch any of the blood vessels in Caleb's brain. His caretakers say he's a ‘miracle.’”

""Most of the time I'm just known as Sarah's dad,"" said Huckabee, cutting short his introduction.

Asked how he felt with his new title, Huckabee said he didn't mind taking a back seat to his daughter, who served as the White House press secretary under Trump before leaving her post in June.

""It's fine,"" he said, ""I don't mind sharing some of the public scorn with my daughter.""

At one point in the episode, Huckabee took a jab at 2020 Democrat Joe Biden, referencing a recent gaffe made by the former vice president during a Democratic presidential primary debate last month.

Huckabee joked that if he didn't perform well on the quiz show, he'd make sure his agent never booked him on the show again -- and Shillue granted him permission to ""call his direct line"" if that were the case.

41,Marc Thiessen,"The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.
No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct… [+4591 chars]",Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020.,2019-09-20,Fox News,"Marc Thiessen: Impeach Kavanaugh? Democrats, I say go for it",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/marc-thiessen-impeach-kavanaugh,"The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.

No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment.

""These newest revelations are disturbing,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding ""Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.""

RUSH LIMBAUGH: TREATMENT OF TRUMP BY DEMOCRATS, MEDIA HAS AMERICANS 'QUIETLY SEETHING'

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's ""place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own.

Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and ""follow the evidence to wherever it leads."" That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.

Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.

Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence.

Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sexual predator.

That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas.

As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were ""like an adrenaline shot"" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.

On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of the party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to ""get real."" ""We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'"" Durbin said. ""It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said ""no.""

Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could ""restructure"" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.

Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. In 2016, 26 percent of Trump voters said Supreme Court nominees were the most important issue to them, while only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton's voters mirrored the sentiment. As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.

In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court-packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

Cory Booker's campaign troubles and cautioned against Democrats pursuing impeachment, telling ""Fox & Friends"" on Saturday that the House of Representatives should focus on investigating allegations surrounding the president's previous conversation with Ukraine.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. What initially touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader.

Fox News host Jedediah Bila asked whether it was premature for 2020 presidential candidates to call for the president's impeachment given the amount of information that was available to the public.

""The whistleblower allegations ... should be made available to not just the American people, but Congress. Let's get Congress to take a look at these allegations and let's look at it very thoroughly,"" she said. Brazile added that the inspector general should be able to speak about the issue without interference from others in the administration.

DEMS CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT OF 'CRIMINAL' TRUMP AS NEW DETAILS SURFACE ON CALL WITH UKRAINE

""Beyond all of that, it's just rhetoric. It's just campaign rhetoric ... let's get all of the information out on the table,"" she said.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump did not mention any explicit quid pro quo on his phone call with Zelensky but media figures have raised concerns about Trump's decision, a month later, to hold $250 million to the eastern european ally.

Sen. Booker, D-N.J., responded to the report by reiterating his previous calls for impeachment, tweeting Friday that Trump was engaging in ""moral vandalism.""

""This story is stunning and should be shaking Washington right now—Donald Trump's moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president. As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings,"" he said.

Booker is facing his own challenges. A campaign memo Saturday, confirmed by Fox News, revealed that the 2020 hopeful needed to raise $1.7 million in 10 days, the end of the third qurater. Without that money, the campaign said, Booker wouldn't have a ""legitimate long-term path forward.""

Brazile, a former campaign manager and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, highlighted how detrimental fundraising could be to a presidential race.

""If you're running out of money, it means that you're running out of fuel. You cannot maintain offices in all of the key states, pay staff people -- which, of course staff people need to get paid -- and, this is the worst part, the candidate can't travel,"" Brazile said.

She claimed that even if Booker left the 2020 race, he was a ""bright man"" who had a ""bright future.""

""He's a proven leader and this is not the end of Cory Booker,"" she said.

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM

The complaint made by an unnamed intelligence official, reportedly involved Trump asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son for alleged wrongdoing while the elder Biden was vice president.

U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., echoed the idea that such complaints hamper the president in his work.

“It would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn’t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it’ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,” Meadows said, according to The Post.

Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., said private phone calls with foreign leaders are part of the president’s job.

“The fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the ‘sole organ’ of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders,"" he said. “There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.”

But he added he’s in favor of transparency.

The administration is also taking flak for not sharing the complaint with Congress.

Most Republicans avoided commenting on the complaint, and while a few did express concerns, they were limited.

Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be “wildly inappropriate” for a president to ask a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election, but added he isn’t accusing Trump of doing that.

Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, broke with Republicans in saying some on his side of the aisle might join Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in subpoenaing the president's phone records.

“It’s certainly on the table,” he said. “When I say that I want to protect congressional oversight, I really mean that.”

Responding Friday on ""Fox & Friends,"" former Clinton campaign strategist Mark Penn said the primary reason for Clinton's loss was Trump turning working-class voters away from the Democrats.

""Officials [in Wisconsin] made every excuse in the books to prevent people from voting,” Clinton said Tuesday at George Washington University.

“You can run the best campaign and have the best plans and get the nomination and win the popular vote and you can lose the Electoral College and therefore the election,” she added.

Clinton appeared to claim that she lost voters because the Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act. She called the 2018 midterm elections a ""case study in voter suppression,"" arguing it is the reason Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia gubernatorial race.

Penn said Clinton could have put herself in a strong position to win the nomination again in 2020, but instead, her poll numbers have steadily declined.

""If she had conceded the election cleanly and talked about the issues, she actually would have been in a great position to get back in today ... her ratings are 10 percent below Donald Trump because she goes out and says it was all unfair,"" Penn argued.

""I wish she would concede the election. I think everyone would see her in a better light if she did,"" said Penn, adding that he has the ""greatest respect"" for Clinton and that she has a ""fair point"" to try to drive voter turnout among Democrats."

Booker’s statement prompts thi… [+5307 chars]",Government should provide a safety net for those who need it -- not for those who don't.,2019-09-20,Fox News,Jim Breslo: Why should government get involved in health care for people who don’t need assistance?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jim-breslo-health-care-for-all,"For the third straight time, the Democratic presidential debate in Houston led with a discussion of health care. As Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it: ""Every one of my colleagues on this stage believes in universal health care.""

Booker’s statement prompts this question: Why should government get involved in health care for Americans who do not require government assistance?

Most Americans believe the government should provide a ""safety net"" for the poor. It does this with assistance such as food stamps. However, you do not hear anyone calling for an expansion of food stamps to cover all Americans regardless of whether they are rich or poor. So why is that the case with health care?

HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED

The federal government, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – more commonly known as food stamps – provides assistance to low-income people. The government does not make the food or control the price of food. It does not dictate what foods people should buy. And the government provides absolutely no food assistance to the majority of American households.

This is a ""safety net."" It is designed to make sure the poorest among us have food on their table.

There seems to be broad agreement that food stamps are a good way to address the nutritional needs of our poor. In health care, we have something similar. It is called Medicaid. It provides funding for medical services for low-income and disabled people.

We also have Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage for older Americans. So the government already has programs in place to take care of the health of our poor and elderly.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Until President Obama came along, there seemed to be rough consensus that this was the right way to ensure America took care of its poor and elderly.

Most Americans were, presumably, in a position to take care of their own health care. Most accomplished this by working in job that provided health benefits, buying their own insurance, or relying on a parent or spouse's health insurance plan. Others chose not to buy insurance and to pay for care as they received it.

Obama and his fellow Democrats insisted that every American have government health care or private insurance, and thus devised ObamaCare, which expanded Medicaid to cover more Americans.

In order to cover everyone else, for the first time in our nation’s history the federal government made it illegal not to purchase a particular product: in this case, health insurance. Yes, even if you paid tens of thousands of dollars for your child to become a doctor who could take care of you for free, you still were legally obligated to buy health insurance.

Now health care is again front and center for Democrats. They say ObamaCare is not enough. They insist America must provide free health care for every single American, old and young, rich and poor.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., criticized former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan in the last debate because it only covered 97 percent of Americans! For his part, Biden proudly announced that under his plan the government will tell drug companies what they can charge for drugs.

With government now involved in everyone’s health care, we are seeing the adverse effects. Everyone is now on government health care or mandatory insurance, and insurance premiums cost the same regardless of a person’s heath, destroying much of the free market in health care.

Where are the menus of services with prices at the doctor’s office? They are not there because people do not care what the cost is because they don’t pay it!

The government and insurance companies are in the middle, determining what and how much to pay, but never sure about what services the doctor or hospital actually provided. Fraud, therefore, runs rampant. Patients have no incentive to shop for better pricing, and doctors have no incentive to provide it. Patients similarly have no financial incentive to avoid doctor visits by maintaining a proper diet and exercise.

As a result, we have runaway increases in the costs of health care. The Democratic solution? For Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others on the stage, it is to put the final bullet in what is left of the free market in health care. Progressivism has taken over the Democratic Party. It no longer believes in free markets.

History shows that if government would get out of the way and allow the free market to do its thing, there is no telling what solutions would emerge for health care. New technologies utilizing the Internet, cell phones, Skype, and artificial intelligence would be fully exploited. Competition would bring down prices, as we have seen in areas of medical care not covered by the government or insurance companies.

Sanders complains that America is ""the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people."" America also is the richest country on Earth. Has he ever considered that the two may be related? It is precisely because America does not hand over control of large sectors of its economy to the government that we have had such economic success.

Why is a safety net insufficient for Democrats? Is it about control? Is it about destroying free-market capitalism wherever they can? Is it in pursuit of a liberal utopia where everyone is treated the same?

We do not know. The question was never asked.

Trump’s call is reportedly the source of a complaint by a whistleblower against the president that has sparked a furor among Democrats in Congress, who are demanding to see the complaint.

If, as multiple news organizations are reporting, the whistleblower’s complaint centers on Ukraine, there is strong evidence that it relates to President Trump’s urging the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

The story behind that story is itself worthy of serious scrutiny.

The proposed investigation involves Hunter Biden’s involvement with a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company while then-Vice President Biden was overseeing America’s Ukraine policy.

Critics of the president have accused Trump of attempting to “extort” Ukrainian officials for “dirt” on Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year.

But why would Ukraine have dirt on Joe Biden? For answers, one must look at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company which, until earlier this year, employed Hunter Biden.

In April 2014, Hunter Biden agreed to join Burisma’s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues, The New Yorker reported. Biden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help.

Earlier that month, British officials had frozen the London bank accounts of Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own corruption investigation into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported.

Hunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, The New York Times reported.

The younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma.

Hunter Biden claims he had no role in the investigation of the company, and that he never spoke about it with his father – but the facts show a troubling overlap with the Obama administration’s actions in Ukraine.

On April 16, 2014, White House records show that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s business partner, made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Biden. Five days later, on April 21, Joe Biden landed in Kiev for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials.

Soon the United States and the International Monetary Fund would be pumping more than $1 billion into the Ukrainian economy, as I wrote in the New York Post.

The next day, there was a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, on May 13, it was officially announced that Hunter Biden would join, too. Like Hunter Biden, Archer had no background or experience in the energy sector.

In March 2016, Ukrainian officials fired Viktor Shokin, the controversial prosecutor general whose office was overseeing the investigation into Burisma, The New York Times reported.

Six months later, the Burisma case was dropped entirely, the Kyiv Post reported.

According to Joe Biden himself, the former vice president played a key role in the prosecutor’s dismissal.

In March 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if Shokin was not fired, according to Biden, who recounted the exchange in a 2018 speech: “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b----. He got fired.”

While the propriety of Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president is certainly questionable and worthy of inquiry, the investigation he was hoping for certainly seems warranted on its own merits.

""You have also praised Vice President Mike Pence as a decent guy,"" Lenz said, drawing boos from the crowd. ""You're a lovely person,"" Biden shot back with a smile on his face.

Lenz defended herself, saying that she was just ""asking the questions that people want to know."" According to some, like Time Magazine editor Anand Giridharadas, Biden's response was related to the moderator's gender.

""Last week, Joe Biden gave us an occasion to talk about 'racism with a smile.' Now he’s doing 'sexism with a smile.' Watch him grow angry at @lyzl's solid question -- and then try to slap her down in the most patronizing way,"" Giridharadas tweeted on Saturday.

Jamil Smith, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, similarly accused Biden of ""Paleolithic behavior."" ""I admire Lyz’s professionalism in this moment,"" he tweeted.

""Sad that it was even necessary. Biden keeps exhibiting this kind of Paleolithic behavior, and too many folks will excuse it because they’re used to seeing their male elders act like way. There is no such thing as benevolent sexism.""

Others piled on with critical tweets on Saturday. After the exchange on Friday, Lenz hinted that Biden continued his sarcasm as she walked off the stage.

""As I was walking off the stage with @JoeBiden he said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart,'"" she tweeted.

Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The former vice president has also faced scrutiny for allegedly inappropriately touching women and his longtime support of the Hyde Amendment, a policy blocking taxpayer funding of most abortions. Biden announced he had changed his stance and opposed the Hyde Amendment earlier this year, shortly after his run for the presidency."

First, our constitutional system is based on friction between competing branches vested with separate but closely related powers. The framers understood that the two political branches would periodically try to usurp each other’s authorities. Congress often does this by enactments that seek to subject executive power to congressional (or judicial) supervision. Presidential pushback on such laws is not criminal obstruction; it is the Constitution in action.

Second, we’ve become so law-obsessed that we miss the forest for the trees.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden.

Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his role as VP in pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as vice president, worked to protect the company from investigation.

On Saturday, Biden said that he had never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings in Ukraine, and backed calls for the House to investigate -- as well as suggesting it could begin a path to impeachment.

“Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached but I’m not making that judgment now,” he said. “The House should investigate it, this appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.”

He went on to call Trump a “serial abuser.”

“He abuses power everywhere he can and if he sees any threat to staying in power, he’ll do whatever he has to do -- but this crosses the line,” he said.

CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT

Biden’s remarks came just hours after Trump dismissed the controversy as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt” being stoked by the Democratic Party and the “fake news media,” and said that the real scandal was to do with Biden’s interactions in the country.

“The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,” he tweeted.

“Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!”

What initially touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader.

Trump dismissed the story as “ridiculous"" and a ""partisan hack job"" from the Oval Office on Friday and said his calls with foreign leaders are “always appropriate.”

The whistleblower complaint led House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democrats to call for an investigation and for the administration hand over the complaint as well as a transcript of the call -- even as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to share details with lawmakers.

Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

On Saturday Trump said that the media was turning the story into one about him, as they are trying to “protect” the Democratic frontrunner.

“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” he tweeted. “Will fail again!”

Biden, his two leading competitors in the Democratic presidential primaries and President Trump are all in their 70s. The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70.

Are all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet?

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE

Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind.

But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents.

Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A Fox News poll that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May.

Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president.

But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House.

So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier.

But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia?

Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less.

And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget.

And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own.

More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker database, as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.”

“President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported.

Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.”

But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.”

We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes.

And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond.

Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people.

But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes.

Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their

children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire.

Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year. An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012.

And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said.

According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.”

I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong.

And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia.

The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners.

My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.

CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT

Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2020, faced scrutiny for months over accusations that he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at that time was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Biden's son.

Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump, has suggested that Biden worked to protect the company from investigation while in office. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility.

The issue involving the Bidens resurfaced Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine.

Schweizer implied Hunter Biden's credentials didn't match with the position he held, and that the situation looked suspicious.

""He is supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is, What is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise, he has none,"" Schweizer said. ""His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine.""

Giuliani first said no when Cuomo asked if he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying instead that he asked the country to investigate allegations of election interference by Ukraine for the benefit of Hillary Clinton. He later said he did ask Ukraine to investigate a newly appointed prosecutor. Cuomo replied, “So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?” and Giuliani responded, “Of course I did.” When Cuomo called out the apparent contradiction, Giuliani followed up, “No. I didn't ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme.”

TRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ‘WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,’ TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES

“The no was obviously wrong, I corrected it immediately,” Giuliani said on “Fox News Sunday,” adding, “I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client.”

Hunter Biden had been the subject of an investigation by Ukrainian authorities based on his business dealings with energy company Burisma. Giuliani said the case was dropped only after then-Vice President Biden got the prosecutor fired and then had influence over the selection of his replacement.

“You don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy’s going on,” Giuliani said.

He explained that his original purpose in going to Ukraine was to look into election interference, not the Bidens, but the two matters were “inextricably combined,” so one led to the other.

“This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove.”

Biden has denied any wrongdoing, although he publicly said in the past that he threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if they did not fire the prosecutor. That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, already had been facing allegations of corruption.

It was reported last week that during a July phone call, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani in investigating the Bidens. Trump fought back Sunday, telling reporters he “said absolutely nothing wrong.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., surged ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden in a new poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers released late Saturday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg slipping into a distant third and fourth, respectively.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. By comparison, the Register poll in June showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

J. Ann Selzer, president of pollster Selzer & Co., told the Register the survey represented ""the first major shakeup” of the Iowa race, because: ""It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.""

Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June.

Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., rounded out the top five, with six percent of voters saying she was their first choice. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Cory Booker, D-NJ, both received three percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer each received three percent.

The polling shakeup may not be done, as 63 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Harris, Buttigieg and Booker could still benefit from late deciders, as 39 percent, 37 percent and 35 percent of poll respondents said they were still actively considering those respective candidates.

The poll came from a sample size of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 14-18.

The most recent Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide showed Biden with 29 percent support, down six percentage points from his peak in May. Sanders was in second place at 18 percent, up eight percentage points from the previous month's poll, while Warren was on 16 percent, down four points from August."

Devin Nunes predicted on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Joe Biden's campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of newly resurfaced reports about his possible misconduct in Ukraine that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race.""

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren surging ahead of Biden as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June.

Nunes, speaking to anchor Maria Bartiromo, said a whistleblower's allegation that President Trump had acted inappropriately during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will ultimately backfire, and shine a light on Biden's own possible misconduct. CNN later acknowledged that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of the call, and a top Ukrainian official on Saturday defended Trump's actions.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

""These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,"" Nunes said. ""So now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme -- maybe this whistleblower really is not a partisan. We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero.""

Late Sunday, Trump echoed Nunes' comments, and emphasized that Biden recently bragged about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor when he was vice president. At the time, the prosecutor was probing a company closely linked to Biden's son, Hunter.

""Sleepy Joe Biden ... forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""That's the real story!""

Nunes said the ever-deepening schism in the Democratic Party over whether to impeach the president -- highlighted late Saturday when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called it a major ""scandal"" that Democrats hadn't yet voted to impeach -- would help Trump in 2020.

""The more I think that they’re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is reelected,” Nunes added.

There were parallels, Nunes said, with Democrats' ultimately debunked claims that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.

""This has all the hallmarks of the Russia hoax,"" Nunes said. ""Something leaks out. ... and then it's the same reporters that report on it, the same reporters that reported on the Russia hoax. Then you move forward, and what happens? Then supposedly they come and testify -- and the night before they testify, the whistleblower who supposedly doesn't want anybody to know who this person is, or what information they have, well, it's spilled all over the pages of the Washington Post"" the day before Congress was briefed on the matter.

""Whoever came up with this scheme -- it looks like somebody was trying to deflect what Biden did back in 2015,"" Nunes said. ""This scheme seems to have backfired on Biden. I mean, Biden's already dropping in the polls.""

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe.

At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly boasted about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

Unverified reports circulated on left-leaning media outlets claiming that Trump could have even promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved.

Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" However, the president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE

DNI Inspector General Michael Atkinson said in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

“Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,” Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday.

""At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower’s full complaint to the Committee,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Sunday afternoon. ""We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.""

Pelosi also seemingly threatened that she would back impeachment if her demands were not met, in a potentially major shift to her wait-and-see approach thus far: ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine. The president has said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

“I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

“Well, son of a b-tch, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats, and that they have been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department.

A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump told Fox News that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed they would be reviewed by the DOJ.

Additionally, attention focused anew on President Obama's hot-mic comment to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a nuclear disarmament summit in March 2012, in which Obama was overheard saying he would have more ""flexibility"" to negotiate with Russia after the November 2012 election.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power.""

“Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden told reporters in Iowa.

But Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about it.

“And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Of course you spoke to your son!”

Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.""

Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted.

Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

“I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,” Trump said outside the White House before departing for Houston. “There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,” he later added.

Trump did point fingers at Biden, however. The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke “just once” about it.

“And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said Sunday. “Of course you spoke to your son!”

When asked about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump said it had nothing to do with the Biden family.

""Because I want Germany, and I want France, and I want the European Union to put up money,"" Trump said. ""And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid to the best of my knowledge.""

BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., doubted that Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy was innocent.

""Well if that’s the case, then why doesn’t the president simply release the transcript of that call?” Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Schiff also challenged Trump to allow the release of the whistleblower complaint, accusing Trump of not wanting to see either one.

The Democratic congressman has long been a vocal critic of the president but has not been among those calling for his impeachment. Schiff said that may change in light of the reports of Trump's conversation with Ukraine.

""If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.”

Giuliani has acknowledged that he was involved in investigating Hunter Biden, but claimed that his original goal was to investigate ties between Ukraine and Democrats related to the 2016 election. He denied that he was specifically out to get Biden.

“What they’re trying to say is I went there on a political mission to get Joe Biden in trouble,” Giuliani told “Fox News Sunday,” calling such a claim “ridiculous.”

Giuliani said that the suspicion of Biden’s wrongdoing related to his son’s case was “inextricably linked” to what he had already been investigating related to the Democratic Party.

“This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove,” Giuliani said.

Trump said he would be amenable to Giuliani discussing the matter before Congress.

“I would have no problem,” the president said. “Rudy’s a straight shooter, and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people when it comes to Ukraine.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also fielded questions about Ukraine on “Fox News Sunday,” but declined to get into specifics, only stating that Trump’s discussions with world leaders “have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful.”

ROBERTS: The United States continues its campaign of maximum pressure on the Islamic regime and --

MARK ESPER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature.

ROBERTS: Points the finger at Tehran for those Saudi oil attacks.

ROBERTS: We'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the options on the table live only on ""FOX News Sunday"".

Then, we'll get reaction from Democrat Ben Cardin, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It's a ""FOX News Sunday"" exclusive.

Plus, reports the president had an inappropriate phone call with the president of Ukraine.

REPORTER: Did you discuss Joe Biden, his son, or his family?

TRUMP: It doesn't matter what I discussed. It's a partisan whistle- blower.

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know I'm up against it. A serial abuser. That's what this guy is. He abuses power everywhere he can.

ROBERTS: We'll discuss with President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

Plus, ask or send a panel how the growing controversy is fueling impeachment talks. All right now on ""FOX News Sunday"".

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERTS: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The war of words over the Saudi oil attacks, which the United States blames on Iran, has turned into action, the Pentagon announcing it will send more troops to the region to boost security for allies and President Trump approving new sanctions on Iran's central bank.

But the president also signaling he is not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike, which the Iranian regime has declared would mean all-out war. In a moment, we'll speak with the president's top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, who just returned from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.

But first, Kevin Corke is traveling with the president, who has a rally today in Houston with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Kevin, good morning.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: John, good day to be with you.

Right. We'll have more on that rally coming up in just a few moments, but by any measure, John, the Iranians are suffering greatly under this latest round of U.S. sanctions, just one of many weapons in the U.S. arsenal as it considers what to do next about Iran's Saudi attack.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TRUMP: We have just sanction the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions.

CORKE: We'll see what happens, a familiar refrain from President Trump. When asked with the U.S. might do next to respond to Iran's attacks on Saudi oil fields. Iran denies it was behind those attacks. In addition to more sanctions, the president has authorized sending a battery of U.S. forces to the region at Saudi request.

ESPER: As the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary.

CORKE: The strikes, which Washington says it can prove came from Iran, have pushed the regent to the brink.

For its part, Tehran is threatening to escalate the violence should the U.S. or the Saudis attack even in limited form.

MAJOR GENERAL HOSSEIN SALAMI, IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER: A limited invasion will not remain limited. We hand down and punish. We have proven it before.

CORKE: That warning comes under day that saw the regime put its military capabilities on display, with a series of parades to mark the 39th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war and comes months after the Iranians downed and a American surveillance drone in international airspace.

This in a week that will see a gathering of world leaders at United Nations General Assembly in New York where Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he'll present a Gulf security plan.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: All this as the U.S. welcomes another world leader. This time it's Narendra Modi, as you mentioned, the prime minister of India. He's here for a ""Howdy, Modi"" Texas rally with President Trump. It is set to be the largest American audience to see a foreign leader speak other than the pope.

We'll bring it to you throughout the day. But for now, thank you.

ROBERTS: OK, Kevin Corke, thanks very much.

The president with an afternoon event with Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia as well.

Kevin, we'll see you soon. Thanks.

Joining me now from New York is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Mr. Secretary, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

POMPEO: John, it's great to be with you.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, earlier in the week, you said of the attack against the Saudi oil facilities that it was, quote, an act of war, and you said that Iran was definitely behind it. When you say something is an act of war, does that demand ultimately a military response?

POMPEO: Well, John, our mission set has been very clear. President Trump would like to have a diplomatic solution, that's the task that's in front of us. That's what we've been aiming for for a little over two years now with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime.

And, John, you know the history. Forty years of terror from Iran. It's an anti-Semitic set of leaders that would like to wipe Israel and America from the face of the earth. Our mission set is to avoid war.

You saw what Secretary Esper announced on Friday, we're putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense, with our objective to be very clear, to support the Iranian people so that they can get this regime to cease behaving in a way that is so destructive not only to their own country, but to the entire Middle East.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, there are reports this morning that Houthi militants in Yemen have warned both Saudi Arabia and the United States that Iran may be planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. Is that true?

POMPEO: So, I've certainly seen that reporting and I won't talk about American intelligence and what we know. But suffice it to say, we are consistently concerned that Iran will continue to behave in the way that it has now for 40 years, it did so before the JCPOA, it did so during the JCPOA, and they continue to act in ways that are inconsistent with our obligations.

I'm here this week at the United Nations. I traveled to Jeddah and to Abu Dhabi this week.

The whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor. They are the evil force in the region. They are destabilizing in the Middle East, and I hope this week here in New York, the whole world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership that this behavior is simply unacceptable.

ROBERTS: That may be a tough hill to climb though, yes?

POMPEO: I think there's a handful of countries that are actually supportive of Iran and what Iran is doing are certainly unwilling to push back. But it's the case; this is the world's responsibility to respond from these state-on-state acts of war that took place in Saudi Arabia this past week.

ROBERTS: If Iran were to launch, in the middle of all of this, another attack against Saudi Arabia, would the United States have any other option but to respond militarily?

POMPEO: John, unlike the previous administration, we try -- we do our best to avoid talking about what we will do, but the American people should know, just like the Iranian people should know, America is prepared to respond in ways that are consistent with America's national security interests.

Our first aim, of course, is to keep the American people safe and secure, and part of that is to make sure that we have all the things in place so that we can do that.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, many military and foreign policy experts, even members of the president's own support group, believe that in calling off the retaliatory strike in response to that drone shoot-down at the last minute, the president signaled to Iran that there are no consequences for its malign activities. What do you say to that criticism?

POMPEO: Well, first of all, there have been consequences, real consequences. The Iranian economy will shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year in front of us, and we took a handful of actions, some of which I can't talk about here. So there were certainly consequences.

The Iranians aren't looking for a green light. The Iranians have behaved poorly for 40 years. And so, it's not the case that any particular response has allowed the Iranians to think they have freedom to move about the cabin (ph).

I assure you of this: the Iranian leadership understands four-square that President Trump will take appropriate action and impose appropriate costs on Iran if they continue to act in the way that they've done over these past now 40 years.

ROBERTS: You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, at the beginning of this, the sanctions that President Trump put on Iran. On Friday, he said that there were sanctions at the highest level. If these sanctions don't work, what's next? What's left?

POMPEO: Well, they are working, John. The toughest of the sanctions, the essential ban on the -- Iran's ability to sell its crude oil around the world took effect only --

(CROSSTALK)

POMPEO: -- in May of this year.

ROBERTS: But what I mean is if they don't work -- if they don't work to bring Iran to the table.

POMPEO: As Secretary Esper said on Friday night, we're prepared to act in ways that are necessary in order to achieve the outcome President Trump has very clearly laid out. I talked about it a year ago, in May. We know what the objectives are. We simply want Iran to behave like a normal nation.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, is it possible that if there were a retaliatory military strike against Iran, that it would be able to be contained, or would it, as Javad Zarif and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Council have warned, erupt into all-out conflagration in the Middle East, which would likely involve U.S. bases in the region, would likely also possibly involve Israel?

POMPEO: We're certainly deeply aware of the risks. That's why we want to resolve this in a way that doesn't resort to kinetic action, if it's at all possible to achieve that.

But as for Zarif, I don't know why nobody listens to him. He has nothing to do with Iranian foreign policy. He lies all the time.

We need to make sure that we do the right things to protect and secure America and do our best to provide the resources to the Emirates and the Saudis, who I had a chance to speak to this week on my trip, so that they have increased capability to defend themselves and their own people. And when we -- when we do those things, I'm confident that we will have set the conditions for deterrence. And if that deterrence should continue to fail, I'm also confident President Trump will take the actions that are necessary.

ROBERTS: All right. We will see what happens at the United Nations General Assembly this week. I'll see you there later on today.

Let's switch to this whistleblower complaint. We still don't know the exact substance of the complaint but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And we have heard from reporting in ""The Wall Street Journal"" that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.

To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials?

POMPEO: Well, John, you're asking me to comment on an I.C. (ph) report I haven't seen and some reporting -- I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever.

As for appropriate action, I've watched the president engage with the Ukrainian leadership. I listened to conversations. I remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapon systems to Ukraine. This president has chosen to do that not once, not twice, but now three times, so that the Ukraine people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast Ukraine.

You remember, it was the previous administration that allowed Vladimir Putin to take one fifth of the Ukrainian country.

We're going to see President Zelensky this week. I do hope -- I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, if he had a conflict of interest or entered (ph) -- or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, you said that you have not seen the complaint, not many people have. I assume, though, that you have seen a transcript of the telephone call that the president had with Zelensky.

Should a transcript of that be released to clear the air?

POMPEO: I'll ultimately leave that to the White House. But you know, John, those are private conversations between world leaders, and it's -- it's not often that those are released. And when they're done, it's done when the White House deems it appropriate. And I'll leave whether that should be released to them.

ROBERTS: Again, I assume that you've seen the transcript. Is it as described in ""The Wall Street Journal""?

POMPEO: You know, I haven't seen ""The Wall Street Journal"" piece, John. There's a lot going on in the world.

ROBERTS: Right.

The whistleblower complaint reportedly alleges a quid pro quo or a promise made to a foreign leader. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports there was no evidence of a quid pro quo in that call with Zelensky. Was there a quid pro quo -- was there a request to investigate Biden and/or his son? And was that linked to a promise of aid?

POMPEO: John, I've watched this president evaluate how and when and to the extent we should provide support to Ukraine, both defense assistance and other foreign assistance, we've been at the center of that.

Those conversations have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful, and 100 percent ensuring that the American taxpayers were protected, that we put those resources to good use and we've got good outcomes in Ukraine when we used American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukrainian leadership -- every single time, John.

ROBERTS: If there was a quid pro quo, would that be a problem?

POMPEO: John, you're asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report I haven't seen. Come on.

ROBERTS: I mean, if an American leader says to a foreign leader, we will do this and it might have something to do with USA, in exchange for this, is that a problem?

POMPEO: John, it's the case we have foreign assistance that is evaluated against American objectives consistently. It's my duty to protect America by making sure that when foreign assistance is provided to countries, that America benefit from that. And it's completely appropriate to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are used appropriately.

ROBERTS: Do believe that there should be an investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian gas company?

POMPEO: I'll leave that to others, but I certainly think it's appropriate if there's concerns and there's enough information to justify looking into it. The American people deserve to know if that was handled in an appropriate way by Vice President Biden.

ROBERTS: Just before we go, Mr. Secretary, are you ruling out a run for the Senate from Kansas next year?

POMPEO: I've said the same thing, John, for a long time. As long as President Trump is going to have me as secretary of state, which I hope is a long time, that's what I'm going to continue to do.

ROBERTS: I'm sure he wants you as secretary of state for a long time. I'm just wondering if you still have aspirations for the Senate.

POMPEO: It's what I want to do, too. I want to be President Trump's secretary of state.

ROBERTS: All right. Secretary Pompeo, we'll see you later on in New York.

POMPEO: Thank you, sir.

ROBERTS: Thanks for joining us.

We'll be following all the action, of course, at the United Nations General Assembly next week.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: Interactions between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and the president of Ukraine are under scrutiny following reports of a whistle- blower complaint, claiming that the president urged the Ukrainian to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially influencing the 2020 race.

Joining me here live in Washington to talk more about this is Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.

Rudy, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday.""

RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How are you? How are you, John?

ROBERTS: I'm good. Thanks for joining us.

Let's clear something up, first of all.

GIULIANI: Sure.

ROBERTS: Let's dial the clock back to Thursday, play this exchange between you and Chris Cuomo on CNN, in which you appeared to at first say you didn't ask Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and/or his son, and then you seemed to change her mind.

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: Listen. Listen here.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Did you to ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?

GIULIANI: No.

Actually, I didn't.

CUOMO: You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden...

GIULIANI: The only thing I asked about Joe Biden...

CUOMO: ... and his role with the prosecutor?

GIULIANI: ... is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed...

CUOMO: Right.

GIULIANI: ... dismissed the case against AntAC.

CUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?

GIULIANI: Of course I did.

CUOMO: You just said you didn't.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: All right, so which is it? Did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask Ukraine to look into it or not?

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: I clarified it immediately.

ROBERTS: All right.

GIULIANI: He said to me, did you ever talk about Joe Biden? I said no. Then I said, I did say that you should investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.

The no was obviously wrong. I corrected it immediately.

ROBERTS:

GIULIANI: I corrected it before he corrected it.

The reality is, the distinction is this. What they are trying to say is, I went there for a political mission to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble.

Ridiculous.

I went there as a lawyer defending his client. I -- I have known about this for five months. I have been trying to get people to cover this for five months. So, I knew it would be very, very hard to get this out.

And what I'm talking about, this, it's Ukrainian collusion, which was large, significant, and proven with Hillary Clinton, with the Democratic National Committee, a woman named Chalupa, with the ambassador, with an FBI agent who's now been hired by George Soros who was funding a lot of it.

When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor, who Biden approved -- you don't get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country, unless something fishy is going on.

The new prosecutor dropped the case, not just on Biden's kid and the crooked company that Biden's kid work for, Burisma. That was done as a matter of record in October of 2016, after the guy got tanked.

He also dropped the case on George Soros' company called AntAC. AntAC is the company where there's documentary evidence that they were producing false information about Trump, about Biden. Fusion GPS was there.

Go back and listen to Nellie Ohr's testimony. Nellie Ohr says that there was a lot of contract between Democrats and the Ukraine.

Well, I have all the contacts. And, John, when the rest of this comes out, and when you look at China and the $1.5 billion that the -- that the Biden family took out of China while that guy was negotiating for us, this will be a lot bigger than Spiro Agnew.

They have fallen into a trap.

ROBERTS: So, you went over there to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election?

GIULIANI: Yes. And if I can't do that, I can't defend a client.

I...

ROBERTS: All right, so when did this morph into an investigation of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?

And is it appropriate for you, as a representative of the president, to be going to Ukraine and finding dirt on Joe Biden and/or his son to use politically in 2020?

GIULIANI: Well, that's the way you characterize it. It's certainly appropriate...

ROBERTS: That's the way it appears to line up.

GIULIANI: No, it doesn't.

ROBERTS: You went there for one thing, you found out something else, and that's what you have been digging on this.

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: That's the way the pro-Biden media lines it up.

This began with someone coming to me saying, this information can clear your client about the corruption in Ukraine between the Ukraine, the Democratic Party, the ambassador, and the FBI agent who investigated the case.

(CROSSTALK)

ROBERTS: But it then -- but then it morphs into Biden.

GIULIANI: And -- inextricably combined, because Biden had the guy fired, Shokin.

By the way, his statement is on record. The lazy press could go read it. They don't have to listen to me. There are three videotapes of prosecutors on record, available on here, that nobody has covered for five months, because this town protects Joe Biden.

His family has been taking money from his public office for years, $1.5 billion from China, when our vice president is supposed to be impartially and independently negotiating for us? And the kid, he takes him on Air Force Two to China, and the kid...

ROBERTS: That was in 2013.

GIULIANI: Yes.

And the kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict. China didn't give $1.5 billion to his kid, Biden's kid, a recovering drug addict, Kerry's stepson, and Whitey Bulger's nephew.

Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up on you. Can you imagine...

ROBERTS: This is a company called Rosemont Seneca.

Let me just -- let me just come back, if I could.

GIULIANI: You got to stop for a second.

Whitey Bulger's nephew?

ROBERTS: Let me just stop for a second.

GIULIANI: One-point-five billion coming from China, when our vice president...

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Mr. Mayor...

GIULIANI: That doesn't shock you?

ROBERTS: ... let me stop for a second, because...

GIULIANI: I mean, how far have we deteriorated?

ROBERTS: Let me stop for a second, because we are throwing around a lot of Ukrainian names that people don't know about.

GIULIANI: Well, that's because nobody would ever cover this.

ROBERTS: Viktor Shokin was a prosecutor back when Biden was the vice president.

He was looking into Burisma Holdings...

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: ... of which Hunter Biden was on the board of directors.

GIULIANI: Correct.

ROBERTS: There were some allegations that there was some monkey business going on with Burisma.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Joe Biden -- Joe Biden -- Joe Biden went over to Ukraine in 2016...

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: ... and said that, I'm going to withhold more than a billion dollars in loan guarantees unless you fire this prosecutor.

Joe Biden talked about that in 2018. Let's roll that.

GIULIANI: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here.

And I think it was, what, six hours. I look at it. I said, we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: But Shokin had been heavily criticized for corruption.

And it was the United States and a number of other Western countries who said...

GIULIANI: So is everybody in the Ukraine.

ROBERTS: ... he needs to go.

GIULIANI: More relevant...

ROBERTS: So, was this tied to Hunter Biden, or was this the United States saying, you have got a bad actor there, because he was accused of corruption in his office? And other countries in the West were saying he needs to go as well.

GIULIANI: What does it matter, if the -- if the son is under investigation? He didn't disclose that.

Doesn't the thing strike you? I mean, it is so warped. Doesn't it strike you as strange that he would tell that story and not mention to you that his son's company was the major defendant in the investigation, the guy who was carrying on?

Do you -- I happen to know -- and I have seen the records -- do you know why he was fired? Do you know how the kid was paid? Three million dollars goes from Ukraine to Cyprus -- I'm sorry -- Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, Cyprus to Rosemont Seneca.

I have seen each one of the wires.

When that prosecutor, Shokin, subpoenaed Cyprus, he got a response. I have the record. They gave him all the information, but two people, Hunter Biden and John Kerry's stepson -- I'm sorry -- John Kerry's speechwriter, who was the best friend of his stepson.

ROBERTS: The prosecutor who followed..

GIULIANI: When that happened, Joe Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter.

And he went over there and he got him fired. And the next day, people showed up. And they started on getting the case for the kid dismissed, as well as the case for Soros. And that's what brings me into it.

ROBERTS: Now, the prosecutor -- the prosecutor...

GIULIANI: No, you got to let me finish.

ROBERTS: OK.

GIULIANI: He said, I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden.

Do you know, when I found out about Joe Biden, do know what I told my colleague? They are going to cover this up.

Too bad Biden is involved in this. I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion. The minute I say Biden, that Washington press corps is going to go nuts. They have been covering up for years, China, plagiarism.

ROBERTS: OK. OK. All right.

Now you're straying into areas of opinion, as opposed to fact.

GIULIANI: No, I'm not. I'm straying into what is wrong with us today and the unfairness.

ROBERTS: We need to point out -- we need to point out that Yuriy Lutsenko, who was the prosecutor who was appointed after Shokin was fire...

GIULIANI: Approved by...

ROBERTS: ... resurrected, reanimated the case, and found that Hunter Biden was, in fact, paid millions of dollars.

But Lutsenko said that the board of Burisma was able to pay a board member whatever they wanted, and he didn't see anything wrong with that.

GIULIANI: John, how is the coverage so distorted?

ROBERTS: I'm just pointing out a fact.

GIULIANI: If you did any work, you would find out Lutsenko is the prosecutor that Biden put in.

There's a newspaper article in which Biden approves Lutsenko when he's appointed. Doesn't that strike you as odd, that the vice president would approve a particular prosecutor?

Did you ever bother to look?

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: Let me finish.

ROBERTS: One other point we need to make here before we go.

GIULIANI: No, no, no, I want answer another question unless you let me finish. This is really unfair.

These are very important things that have been covered up for years to protect slimy Joe.

The reality is that there are three other prosecutors where all you have to do is go online, three others, that say that this was done precisely to get rid of Biden, to cover up Hunter, and to cover up Soros.

I will give you their names. One of them is Kulik, Konstantin Kulik. The other is Shokin himself. And the third one is a prosecutor by the name of Inazdir (ph).

They are present officials. Three of them were officials. One is still an official of the Ukrainian government.

If you bothered to look, you could listen to them on tape telling you that. Now, they may all be lying, but Lutsenko may be lying also. But it's 3-1.

ROBERTS: One more point we got to make.

GIULIANI: And Lutsenko is Biden's chosen prosecutor.

ROBERTS: OK. You have made your point.

One more point to make we need to make.

GIULIANI: You will also find there is a great deal of suspicion.

ROBERTS: Yes, Joe Biden yesterday told our Peter -- Joe Biden told our Peter Doocy yesterday that he never discussed overseas business with his son Hunter.

GIULIANI: Do you believe that?

ROBERTS: I don't know. Do you believe that?

GIULIANI: I'm flying my son to China. How long is the flight to China?

ROBERTS: Its a while.

GIULIANI: Fifteen hours, 16 hours, 17?

I'm flying my son to China on Air Force Two. I'm going to negotiate with the Chinese to help America. My son is going there to negotiate to help the Biden family.

When he comes back, and eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict, somebody connected to the vice president of the United States and somebody connected to the biggest gangster in America.

Wait a second. The son doesn't say to him, I got a billion dollars? By the way, you see what Joe said? It's contradicted by the son. The son said, I talked to my father about it.

How about this? There was an article on December 9 of 2015 in ""The New York Times"" raising holy hell about Biden's son being on the board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine and how strange it looked.

I don't know if Joe reads the newspapers, but somebody must have read that to him.

And, finally, if Joe didn't know what his son was doing abroad, how may conflicts are there? This guy was flying blind? I don't know. Did he get money from Russia? Did he get money from Cuba? Was he doing business in Venezuela?

You're telling me that the vice president of the United States was there for eight years. His son is going around the world taking millions from some adversary of the United States.

ROBERTS: Yes.

GIULIANI: Don't say yes. This is important.

ROBERTS: No, no, we have -- I'm saying we have got to go.

GIULIANI: This is about the only time I have gotten to point out a tremendously large scandal that affects the American people.

And it's your job to do it, not just mine. I'm doing it to defend my client.

ROBERTS: We are out of time.

GIULIANI: But you're telling me that he had no system with his son to check on conflicts? So we know of two.

We know there's a big conflict with Ukraine. We know there is a big conflict with China. Since Joe says and is apparently selling the swamp media on the fact that he didn't know, well, Joe, how many more conflicts are there? Venezuela? Cuba?

ROBERTS: You have mentioned that.

We have got to leave it. Mr. Mayor, we are...

GIULIANI: One-point-five billion is enough for most people to get investigated.

ROBERTS: We are out of time for this morning, but, clearly, we are going to keep looking into this.

GIULIANI: And this is going to get bigger and bigger. And everything I say, I can prove.

ROBERTS: Rudy, thanks so much for being with us.

GIULIANI: Take me on.

ROBERTS: All right. Appreciate it.

Coming up, we will get reaction to the president's Iran policy with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Ben Cardin joins us here next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: Coming up, President Trump authorizes new economic penalties on Iran.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We have just sanctioned the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the move will bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: As the United States boosts its defenses in the Middle East after blaming Iran for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Islamic regime says it's ready for any scenario.

Joining me here in Washington, Senator Ben Cardin, a top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator, welcome back to “Fox News Sunday.”

SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD: John, it's great to be with you. Thank you.

ROBERTS: So the U.S. is sending more troops and defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to counter the threat coming from Iran.

Your thoughts about sending more men and material there?

CARDIN: John, this is a very dangerous situation. There could easily be a miscalculation. The temperature couldn't be harder between the United States and Iran.

Our job is to isolate Iran. Iran is the bad actor. And what the president needs to do is get an international coalition to continue to work against Iran's support of terrorism. The challenge, of course, is, because, as the United States has been isolated when the president withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. So we're having difficulty with our European allies to get the type of support we need, but we have to isolate Iran.

ROBERTS: There are reports that -- from the Houthis apparently to Saudi Arabia and to the United States, I don't know if you saw my question to the secretary of state, that Iran is planning another attack in Saudi Arabia.

If Iran were, in the middle of all of this, launch another attack at Saudi Arabia, would that demand a military response?

CARDIN: There's really not a military solution to the problem of Iran. We need to make diplomacy work. Clearly there could be a miscalculation. We have to defend ourselves, no question about that, but we have to reduce the temp -- where we are, where we could have this miscalculation.

It would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in Iran. It will have consequences throughout the entire region. It's not in our national security interests.

ROBERTS: All right, so we've got the United States ramping up sanctions on Iran, withdrawing from the JCPOA, which you yourself didn't -- didn't vote for. And Iran is countering by shooting down American drones, firing missiles and launching drones at Saudi oil facilities. I mean they are in a shooting war. So is -- is this -- is this -- I mean if you let somebody fire at you and you don't shoot back, are you not showing weakness?

CARDIN: Well, John, here -- here's the fault of the Trump policies. Before we withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreements, there were conversations with the Europeans about strengthening the sanctions against Iran for the non- nuclear violations. We could have had that international support and tightens the economic pressure against Iran, but still stay within the nuclear agreement. By pulling out of the nuclear agreement, it's the view of Europe that this is an American problem rather than an international problem.

ROBERTS: But -- but you know the arguments, this president said, look, it covers the nuclear, but it -- there's a sunset clause to it of a decade, which isn't much when you look at, you know, the history of nuclear development. But it also does not do anything to reign in Iran's malign activities.

I pointed out, you yourself did not vote for the JCPOA because you were worried about future uranium enrichment.

So why stay in a bad deal?

CARDIN: No, I agree with that analysis, but the way to fix it is to work with Europe, work with our partners to deal with the non-nuclear violations, strengths the sanctions against Iran on the non-nuclear side, make sure they stay in compliance with the nuclear obligations. They were in compliance with the nuclear obligations when the United States pulled out.

The bottom line is, we made -- the -- we isolated the United States rather than isolating Iran, and Iran is the bad actor. There's no question about it. We don't know what they're going to do, but we certainly need the support of our international partners.

ROBERTS: But how serious is Iran about the JCPOA? The United States pulled out. There is still five signatories to it, yet Iran is violating the agreement.

CARDIN: Well, the issue is, Iran -- we don't know how Iran's calculating this, but we do know that the U.S. sanctions is having a major impact on their economy. So the benefits they thought they were going to get under the nuclear agreement, they're no longer getting.

ROBERTS: Right.

CARDIN: That's causing them to recalculate.

ROBERTS: For the moment, President Trump says he's showing restraint about Iran. He's got people like Secretary Pompeo saying it's an act of war. Others are pointing fingers, like Mark Esper and Pompeo at Iran. The president saying, I'm going to sit back and wait and see how this plays out. Listen to what he said in the Oval Office the other day.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think the strong person's approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint. Much easier to do it the -- the other way. It's much easier. And Iran knows, if they misbehave, they're on borrowed time.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: So you've got the president's aides on the one hand saying, act of war, Iran's responsible. The president saying, I'm waiting and seeing her. He's leaving the door open to negotiation, even amidst all this tough talk.

Could that be a good strategy to try to bring them to the table?

CARDIN: I think it's an important week with all the world leaders -- most of the world leaders meeting up in New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations.

I hope that we can get that type of unity with the international community in regards to Iran so that the military option is not the right option. I agree with Secretary Pompeo that diplomacy should be the way we proceed. I agree with that.

And hopefully this week we can get the type of support in New York to make a difference in the calculation by Iran so that they stop these horrible things.

What they're doing is horrible. We can't let them continue to do that.

ROBERTS: Let me switch to this intelligence committee inspector general whistle-blower report. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported on Friday that the president had a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in which he about eight times pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Joe Biden.

The Ukrainian foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said today, quote, I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. So you have Democrats on the one side calling for the president's impeachment over this, and then you have the Ukrainian foreign minister saying, I don't see any pressure.

CARDIN: I think we need to know what happened. The allegations are that the president used the power of his office for partisan political purposes, jeopardizing the national security of the United States by withholding aid to Ukraine, one of our key, strategic partners. That --

ROBERTS: Nobody's made the connection about aid yet. We don't even know what this thing's about.

CARDIN: We -- we -- at least there's been some reports that there was $250 million that were held up, ultimately was released --

ROBERTS: I think people have connected the dots, but I don't think we've got anything really to back that up.

CARDIN: Well, that's what -- let's find out. Let's -- let's find -- let's have transparency here. We can easily find that out if information about those phone calls would be released and we could see exactly what's involved. But the president has chosen, at least to date, not to release that information.

These are serious allegations. Let's find out.

I -- I -- I don't want to reach a conclusion. I'm just suggesting to you that an allegation that the president used his political office for partisan reasons, jeopardizing our national security, we need to get to the facts.

ROBERTS: Is there a case to be made to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's -- their involvement in Ukraine? Let's listen to what the president said and what Joe Biden said the other day.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country less a certain prosecutor is taken off the case.

BIDEN: Not one single, credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion. Not one single one. And so I have no comment except the president should start to (INAUDIBLE).

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: Now, in fact, a lot of credible news organizations, including ""The New York Times,"" have been looking into this. Ken Vogel, who's the reporter who wrote about it -- and here's the article -- back in May said on Friday that there's -- this could be a significant issue for Joe Biden and that there's more there.

CARDIN: Well -- well, John, I know what happened in 2015 with the prosecutor. The international community needed that prosecutor to leave. Congress wanted that prosecutor to leave. Corruption was the center problem we had with Ukraine, maintaining our coalition against Russia for -- with sanctions. And we had to deal with the corrupt issues and the prosecutor was in the center of that. So that -- that was a policy that we wanted to implement.

Joe Biden's issue has been looked at for a long time. There's been findings that there is no improper involvement. This is a distraction by the president of the United States to distract from his most recent situation.

ROBERTS: You don't want to prejudge the situation with the president and his whistle-blower, but a lot of your Democratic colleagues are already making the leap to impeachment.

Is that going too far?

CARDIN: I -- I think you need to get the facts. I don't think you should -- you know, the impeachment process is a way in which Congress exercises its responsibility, checks and balances in our system. But you can't act on that type of a remedy until you have the facts. So let's get the facts first.

ROBERTS: Senator Cardin, always good to see you.

CARDIN: Nice to be with you.

ROBERTS: Thanks so much for coming in.

Coming up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the prospects of a showdown between the United States and Iran.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's abundantly clear and there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks. It was Iran.

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What would be the consequence of an American or a Saudi military strike on Iran now?

MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: An all-out war.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: The top diplomats from this country and Iran in a war of words this week over the fallout from the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil industry.

And its time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg for ""The National Review,"" Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, Susan Page of ""USA Today,"" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of ""The Washington Free Beacon.""

Are we going to war, Susan, with Iran?

SUSAN PAGE, ""USA TODAY"": Well, judging from your interview with Secretary of State Pompeo, I'd say probably not. He -- you asked them if it's an active war, does that demand a military response, and he repeatedly denied -- declined to say yes. And judging from what the president did in June, after the American drone was shot down and he backed away from a military strike, I think the odds are against us taking military action in this case.

ROBERTS: The fact that he backed away from that strike, does that mean that he cannot take military action?

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, ""WASHINGTON FREE BEACON"": No. I mean he could take military action at any time. He's the commander-in-chief. What we're seeing, though, is that the maximum pressure campaign of the Trump administration has met maximum resistance from the Iranian regime. And the cyber operations and the economic warfare that the Trump White House has been waging against Iran has yet to deter them from their malign behavior in the region. But, that status quo is something I think the president prefers to all-out war.

ROBERTS: Right. It -- the -- Congress is saying he's got to come to Congress for an authorization to use military force against Iran. First of all, does he have to? And if he went to Congress, would he get it?

JONAH GOLDBERG, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": It depends. I think we would need more provocation than what we have seen. I'm sort of a purist on this kind of stuff. I do think that you should go to Congress, unless it's in response to an immediate and urgent national security thing, then it -- Congress has the -- has the sole authority to authorize war. But we've seen that eroded so much over the last 50 years, like so many other congressional prerogatives that I think it's anybody's guess.

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think, John, based on your question, you can tell there's no clear end game in sight. What we know is the president says he doesn't want war there, but he's previously also said we're locked and loaded. And what was incredible to me was to hear him say that he's waiting for guidance to come from the Saudis.

Now, the Iranians are no friends of ours, but, gosh, the Saudis, I don't know if they're a reliable and trustworthy regime. They kill American journalists. 9/11 is not to be forgotten.

ROBERTS: And here's another argument that people made. The United States has sold Saudi Arabia, and the president made a big deal of this, billions of dollars in military equipment. Can't the Saudis handle this themselves?

PAGE: And -- well, I guess we're going to find out. I mean we're making this gesture to Saudi Arabia with a very limited deployment. But -- but, yes, Saudi Arabia has a lot of defensive abilities, a lot of it provided by the United States, helped by the United States.

WILLIAMS: But I think the key point here is, Iran has denied responsibility, but we have no reason to trust that they are not responsible, or at least supporting the Houthi rebels that did this.

But the point from the American political perspective is, we are still trying to get out of Afghanistan. There is no appetite in his country for starting another war without a clear end game in sight. And the president has not provided that.

CONTINETTI: And the president's policy, it reflects exactly that attitude though.

WILLIAMS: Right. We all know what we're doing (ph).

PAGE: And the president's base doesn't back it either (ph).

CONTINETTI: He doesn't want to get involved either.

What's remarkable here, for 70 years plus, the United States has guaranteed the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. That is ending. At its ending because of fracking.

ROBERTS: Let's get on to the whistle-blower issue here.

President Trump, he was leaving for Houston a short time ago. He said this about his conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of the Ukraine, back on July 25th.

Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely perfect. And people better find out who these people are that are trying to subvert our country, because here we go again. These are bad people.

But the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely a ten.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: So it was a ten. Is there anything wrong with the president saying to the president of the Ukraine, look, why don't you work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate what ties Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have to Ukrainian natural gas companies.

PAGE: Yes. It's soliciting foreign help in your campaign for re-election for president of the United States. And it's something that I think people would generally find alarming.

ROBERTS: Now, the Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton, so --

GOLDBERG: Yes, OK, look, I mean we've got to separate a whole bunch of things here. The idea -- you know, people who are -- you know, President Trump has -- has some weird messaging on this. On the one hand he says it's all made up and fake news. On the other hand he says he was spied on, which would suggest that, in fact, the allegations are true.

Rudy Giuliani comes on air today and take great umbrage at the accusation or insinuation that he's a political hit man, and then he spends the next seven minutes like the -- one of the biggest political hit men I've ever seen. It could be -- I don't -- I think there's a lot of smoke and -- and bluster going on in what Giuliani is doing. It could all be true.

If the president of the United States tried to bend national security, based upon his own partisan self-interest, that would be very, very, very bad. And the people who say he's just interested in corruption, this seems to be the only corruption case in the world he's concerned about, is the one about the guy who's beating him by ten points in the polls.

ROBERTS: ""The Washington Examiner"" had an article this morning that suggested that the whistle-blower does not have firsthand knowledge of any of this. But the point is, is that if you're going to investigate the president, and there are 9,573 investigations of the president going on right now, should you not also investigate the person who might become president?

CONTINETTI: A lot of conversations in Washington over the last 48 hours have begun with the word ""if."" And the fact is, we don't know. And so I think the advocates of impeachment in this case carry a heavy burden, John. One is that with the Russian investigation, there was a whole lot of misreporting and factual inaccuracy in the actual reporting. Two, when the Mueller report came out, it did not provide the data that Democrats wanted to impeach. And, third, all of these charges, as illustrated in Rudy Giuliani's interview with you, have the potential to boomerang on the Democratic Party.

ROBERTS: All right, so let me ask you about the Democratic Party, Juan. You heard Ben Cardin say he doesn't want to prejudge anything. He wants the information. He wants to see this.

You've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You've got Elizabeth Warren. You've got a myriad of other Democrats not even waiting for a shred of evidence here. They're looking at reporting and saying, impeach him, off with his head. I mean should they not wait -- do they not have a responsibility to wait until we know some facts here before we got down the impeachment road?

WILLIAMS: Yes, I think everyone should wait. But, remember, there's no reason to wait on the transcript. If, as the president describes it, nothing untoward took place, why is it that the administration is making such an effort to obstruct the Congress from getting that transcript?

What we know is --

ROBERTS: It's not the transcript that they're not holding back --

WILLIAMS: Well --

ROBERTS: It's the complaint.

WILLIAMS: Well, the complaint, the transcript, the whole thing. If -- because the transcript goes beyond the complaint, which is why I said transcript. But the idea is that this administration has, through the Justice Department, stop what is the law. The law says that if you have an urgent complaint, the inspector general of the director of national intelligence would transfer that to the Congress. It's not going on. That is wrong.

GOLDBERG: Previous presidents have also disputed the idea that the president has an obligation by the -- by statute to do that. It's a -- it's a murky constitutional issue.

PAGE: The one Democrat we haven't heard from calling for impeachment is the one Democrat who counts, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She set a standard that we need to hear Republicans be outraged by the president's behavior, not just Democrats. And so far we haven't heard that.

ROBERTS: Fifteen seconds.

CONTINETTI: We'll be waiting for a long time.

ROBERTS: Yes, Fifteen seconds, should the transcript be released?

WILLIAMS: Of course.

CONTINETTI: I think if it exculpates Trump, they should release it.

But there is the issue of executive privilege here, governing foreign communications, which also needs to be respected.

WILLIAMS: If this was Obama, House Republicans would have --

ROBERTS: We've got to go.

Thanks, Juan.

See you next Sunday, by the way.

Coming up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Denzel Washington and the club he says made him the man he is today.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: For many children, the hours between three and 8:00 p.m. are when their futures are decided. As Chris Wallace reported last fall, one organization has opened its doors for over 100 years to make sure that kids have a place to go after school and stay out of trouble. One of those kids became a household name, and he is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DENZEL WASHINGTON, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN: It's where I learned so many life lessons, just thinking I was having fun.

CHRIS WALLACE, HOST (voice over): Denzel Washington is talking with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Four thousand local clubs that provide after-school programs for more than 4 million young people. And, in the process, change lives.

He was in Washington last fall for the group's annual dinner.

WASHINGTON: I remember that first day and how I felt and how special they made me feel.

WALLACE: And to honor the national youth of the year.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malachi Haynes.

WALLACE: Malachi Haynes of Colorado, who's been going to his club since he was six.

MALACHI HAYNES, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 2018 YOUTH OF THE YEAR: Being a leader and a role model in my community is my purpose.

WASHINGTON: I was a wild one. You know, I was -- I had a lot of energy.

WALLACE: Washington used to run track for his club. And he remembers when a new kid came in and started running faster. One of his mentors took him aside.

WASHINGTON: He said, he has natural ability, but his natural ability will only take him so far. So I applied that to -- to -- to my career, my first two years when I started acting in college.

WALLACE: Washington won the first of his two Oscars for his role in ""Glory,"" about an African-American military unit in the Civil War.

For more than 30 years, he's played a series of indelible characters.

WASHINGTON: To protect the sheep, you've got to catch the wolf. And it takes a wolf to catch a wolf, you understand?

I was never interested in being a movie star. We were sort of New York theater snobs. I wanted to be James Earl Jones, you know? I was hoping to make $650 on Broadway one day. And -- and I did.

WALLACE (on camera): Your father was a preacher and I've read that at various points in your life you've thought about becoming a preacher.

WASHINGTON: Uh-huh.

WALLACE: Really?

WASHINGTON: It was prophesies that I would preach. And -- by this woman. And I said, well, maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. And says, well, you already have a pulpit.

WALLACE (voice over): Now, Washington is more about giving back.

WASHINGTON: You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. That's what my pastor told me. You know, you -- whatever you have, you can't take it with you. So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have while you're here?

WALLACE (voice over): The Boys & Girls Clubs deal with the ups and downs of life too. Kids at the clubs do better at school, are less likely to do drugs, and volunteer more. Malachi started his own program to improve reading levels.

HAYNES: We call it Double Trouble. So we do an hour of reading, then an hour of playing basketball, eating pizza, just hanging out and getting to know the kids.

WALLACE: And Denzel Washington says that's the real message here.

WASHINGTON: We're just bombarded so much with negative news that the -- one can just feel like, well, what's the -- what's the use? But listening to these young people saying, oh, no, no, we're going to change it, we're going to do something about it, I'm -- that's inspiring.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERTS: Chris asked Washington where he sees himself at this stage of his career. He says he uses stuntmen more than he used to but is excited about the unknown and what comes next in his life and career.

And that's it for today. Chris is back again next weekend. We will see you next “Fox News Sunday.” Thanks for joining us.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump amounted to a major ""national scandal,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching.

Pelosi, who has long resisted calls to impeach Trump because the move would imperil the electability of moderate Democrats in the House, outlined her new stance in a statement Sunday. Pelosi specifically said that a whistleblower who reportedly alleged that Trump acted improperly during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided.

Her aggressive push came as top Republicans, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, predicted that the gambit would backfire for Democrats. Later in the evening, Trump sounded a similar note, saying the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.""

The whistleblower drama escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that a Ukrainian prosecutor had been investigating as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly bragged about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

CNN later reported the whistleblower had no direct knowledge of the call, and a top Ukrainian official on Saturday defended Trump's actions. Unverified reports circulated on left-leaning media outlets claiming that Trump could have promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved.

But if Democrats' demands were not met, Pelosi said, the Trump administration's ""grave new chapter of lawlessness"" would necessitate drastic action.

""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest,"" Pelosi said.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have hard evidence that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia.

“Why doesn’t the president just say, ‘Release the whistleblower complaint.’ Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,” Schiff said. “This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.”

“We may have crossed the Rubicon here,” he added, referring to the river that Julius Caesar fatefully traversed in 49 BC. “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment. ... but that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.”

The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery tweet: ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.""

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.""

The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

GIULIANI CLARIFIES CONFUSING CNN COMMENTS ON UKRAINE

Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, has long said publicly he wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine, and admitted this week that he's asked Ukraine to do so in the past -- but denied any impropriety or illegal conduct again on Sunday.

""This violation is about our national security,"" Pelosi said. ""The Inspector General determined that the matter is 'urgent' and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately.""

Inspector General Michael Atkinson of the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wrote in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But, the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an ""urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

HOUSE INTEL RANKING REPUBLICAN: THIS IS THE END OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN

""Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,"" Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday.

In her statement, Pelosi said Democrats would be watching closely.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. ""Thank you for your patriotism.""

Even some Republicans cautioned that the situation could be serious. Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a onetime Trump presidential rival, tweeted that ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival,"" that ""would be troubling in the extreme.""

At the same time, California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Biden's campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of the newly resurfaced reports about his possible misconduct in Ukraine that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race.""

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren surging ahead of Biden as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June.

Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

WATCH: POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP AMID WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATION

Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats, and that they'd been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department.

A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump told Fox News that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed the DOJ would review them.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better."" — Former Trump campaign adviser Barry Bennett

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who claimed Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power.""

WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE

""Trump’s doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum, and he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden told reporters in Iowa.

Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken ""just once"" about it.

""And now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,"" Trump said. ""Of course you spoke to your son!""

Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine, and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.""

Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted.

The U.N.'s official schedule says Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 16 other world leaders will attend a General Assembly meeting Tuesday. NBC News White House correspondent Kelly O’Donnell tweeted Friday that the White House confirmed Trump will meet with Zelensky on Wednesday.

It wasn't immediately clear if the second gathering would be a one-on-one meeting.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

Zelensky will also take meetings with leaders of the Ukrainian community in the U.S., leaders of Jewish organizations based in the U.S. and representatives of the American business community, O’Donnell reported. He will also attend the Sustainable Development Summit.

A senior White House official told Axios that Trump will meet with Zelensky to congratulate him on his victory in the eastern European nation’s recent presidential election and his “energy and success"" in battling corruption. The official said Trump will also voice ""his concerns about predatory Chinese economic activity in Ukraine."" Trump’s itinerary also says he’ll meet with the leaders of Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, the U.K., India, Iraq and El Salvador, Axios reported.

Trump will also host a summit Monday on religious freedom. His speech will present the U.S. as an alternative to authoritarianism and underline his ""commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedom,"" administration officials said Friday during a briefing call, according to Axios. Trump will not attend a U.N. meeting that same day that’s slated to focus on climate change.

A secret whistleblower filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, on Aug. 12, detailing a ""promise"" Trump reportedly made to an unnamed foreign leader. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire so far has withheld the complaint from Congress. The Washington Post and the New York Times both reported Thursday that the complaint involved Ukraine.



The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.

Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” while Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call. 2020 hopefuls used the controversy as a chance to renew calls for impeachment.

Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his past role allegedly pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to his son Hunter Biden. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation.

BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL'

The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources.

Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.

And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.”

Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Demissie warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand.

Demissie explained in his memo ""If our campaign is not in a financial position to grow, he’s not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone's first priority.”

While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he’s struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits, far behind top-tier contenders former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

“In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement, adding: ""It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.""

SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY

Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies.

Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use ""public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores.""

The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices.

BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM'

Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost. According to Reuters, the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released.

During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.”

Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President Joe Biden has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option.

Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free.

As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.”"

""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she added.

Her comments followed reports that the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into corruption accusations surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

While many Democrats called for impeachment after the report surfaced, Pelosi reportedly has continued to oppose the ramping-up of impeachment proceedings.

Warren, a 2020 hopeful, was just one of several to condemn Pelosi's inaction on the issue. ""This is absolutely insane,"" Jon Favreau, who previously served in the Obama administration, tweeted.

""We have lifelong conservatives writing pieces about how Trump should be impeached and @SpeakerPelosi ’s advisers are still telling reporters they refuse to hold the President accountable.""

Favreau was responding a tweet by CNBC's John Harwood, which claimed that one of Pelosi's advisers put the kibosh on impeachment. Actress Debra Messing was similarly outraged, calling Pelosi's reluctance ""INSANITY.""

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he may seek to withhold funds from the intelligence community unless they disclose the full contents of the conversation.

Schiff, who serves as the House Intel Committee chairman, appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, where host Jake Tapper asked if Schiff would be willing to put the nation at risk to get to the bottom of the cryptic report.

""It depends on what funds we withhold,"" Schiff replied. ""In this case, you have the office of the director of national intelligence that is withholding this complaint in violation of the clear letter of the law... And there are funding requests that that office makes that don’t go directly to national security that we can withhold.""

The story was first reported by the Washington Post as a whistleblower claim about Trump making some type of ""promise"" to a foreign leader, which may have been of a nefarious nature. Further reporting claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden's son and his business dealings.

""Look, it is a blunt remedy and one that I’m very reluctant to use,"" Schiff continued. ""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious...but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer.""

Schiff also reignited the impeachment debate which seemed to be fading away, after several failed attempts by House lawmakers to oust the president from office.

""If there is a fire burning, it needs to be put out. And that's why we’re going to have to look at every remedy. And if these two issues are, in fact, one issue and it relates to deplorable conduct, a violation of the president’s oath of office... then we're going to have to consider impeachment as well,"" he said.

Trump responded to the story on Twitter Thursday and again on Saturday, saying the narrative was ""fake news"" conjured up by biased members of the media.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has apparently reached a boiling point over moderate House Democrats’ caution regarding the prospect of impeaching President Trump.

The go-slow approach is personified by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with whom Ocasio-Cortez has had an often contentious relationship since the freshman lawmaker arrived in Washington just eight months ago.

The New York Democrat told her more than 5 million Twitter followers late Saturday that the Democrats’ “refusal” to seek the removal of the president was a “bigger national scandal” than what she alleged was the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.”

JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

Calls for impeachment have grown louder from some Democrats in the wake of last week’s news that a purported “whistleblower” had expressed concern about a phone call said to have taken place between President Trump and the leader of Ukraine, in which Trump allegedly sought information about 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, whose son Hunter Biden had business dealings in Ukraine.

Soon after Ocasio-Cortez posted her Saturday comment, she received a response from James Fallows, the noted author, journalist and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, who asserted that Ocasio-Cortez was overstating the case in criticizing members of her own party for exercising restraint regarding impeachment.

LEADING HOUSE DEM TELLS PARTY NOT TO BE 'HASTY' IN PURSUING WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS

“IMO, this is ‘false equivalence’ of its own sort,” Fallows wrote. “What Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem.

“Second-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate.

“Then: it’s time for the House to act.”

Ocasio Cortez doubled down in her response to Fallows.

“It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law,” she wrote. “It’s another to let him.

“The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It’s threatened when we do nothing about it.

“The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s online outburst followed remarks earlier in the day by fellow progressive and 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who took a veiled shot at Pelosi, the standard-bearer among Democrats of a “wait and see” approach regarding potential action against the president.

""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice,” Warren said at an event in Iowa. “I read all 448 pages [of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation] and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump.

“Congress failed to act,” Warren added, “and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system.”

Just over a week ago, Pelosi had lashed out at reporters when they repeatedly asked her about impeachment at a news conference.

“Impeachment is a very divisive measure,” a clearly frustrated Pelosi said, “but if we have to go there, we have to go there and we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we’ll follow the facts and follow the obstruction the president is making ... and make a decision when we’re ready.

“That’s the only question, that’s all I’m going to say about this subject, and there's nothing different from one day to the next,” she added.

The struggles experienced by the 79-year-old Pelosi, a three-decade member of Congress from California, have included frequent clashes with Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and other progressive – and aggressive – young lawmakers who were swept into office during last year’s midterm elections. The progressives’ push for far-left policies, including Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, as well as their vocal opposition to President Trump, have been at odds with the moderates’ typically lower-key approach to getting things done.

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. The meeting was soon followed by the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

But with Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter posts that began late Saturday, it appears the truce with Pelosi – at least regarding impeachment – may be over.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. What initially touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader.

Fox News host Jedediah Bila asked whether it was premature for 2020 presidential candidates to call for the president's impeachment given the amount of information that was available to the public.

""The whistleblower allegations ... should be made available to not just the American people, but Congress. Let's get Congress to take a look at these allegations and let's look at it very thoroughly,"" she said. Brazile added that the inspector general should be able to speak about the issue without interference from others in the administration.

""Beyond all of that, it's just rhetoric. It's just campaign rhetoric ... let's get all of the information out on the table,"" she said.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump did not mention any explicit quid pro quo on his phone call with Zelensky but media figures have raised concerns about Trump's decision, a month later, to hold $250 million to the eastern european ally.

Sen. Booker, D-N.J., responded to the report by reiterating his previous calls for impeachment, tweeting Friday that Trump was engaging in ""moral vandalism.""

""This story is stunning and should be shaking Washington right now—Donald Trump's moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president. As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings,"" he said.

Booker is facing his own challenges. A campaign memo Saturday, confirmed by Fox News, revealed that the 2020 hopeful needed to raise $1.7 million in 10 days, the end of the third qurater. Without that money, the campaign said, Booker wouldn't have a ""legitimate long-term path forward.""

Brazile, a former campaign manager and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, highlighted how detrimental fundraising could be to a presidential race.

""If you're running out of money, it means that you're running out of fuel. You cannot maintain offices in all of the key states, pay staff people -- which, of course staff people need to get paid -- and, this is the worst part, the candidate can't travel,"" Brazile said.

She claimed that even if Booker left the 2020 race, he was a ""bright man"" who had a ""bright future.""

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM

The complaint made by an unnamed intelligence official, reportedly involved Trump asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son for alleged wrongdoing while the elder Biden was vice president.

U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., echoed the idea that such complaints hamper the president in his work.

“It would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn’t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it’ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,” Meadows said, according to The Post.

Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., said private phone calls with foreign leaders are part of the president’s job.

“The fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the ‘sole organ’ of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders,"" he said. “There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.”

But he added he’s in favor of transparency.

The administration is also taking flak for not sharing the complaint with Congress.

Most Republicans avoided commenting on the complaint, and while a few did express concerns, they were limited.

Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be “wildly inappropriate” for a president to ask a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election, but added he isn’t accusing Trump of doing that.

Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, broke with Republicans in saying some on his side of the aisle might join Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in subpoenaing the president's phone records.

“It’s certainly on the table,” he said. “When I say that I want to protect congressional oversight, I really mean that.”

It noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced at a conference that the United States had released $250 million in military aid – with an additional $140 million on top of that sum.

The Trump administration said Thursday [Sept. 12] that it has released $250 million in military aid to Ukraine that had been held up. It didn’t mention additional funds. Zelenskiy’s deputy chief of staff Kirill Tymoshenko confirmed to The Associated Press after the president’s speech that Ukraine is indeed expecting an extra $140 million from the U.S., but he wouldn’t give detail on the source or designation of the funds.

There may very well be nothing to this, but it was a curious series of events. The Trump administration was supposed to give Ukraine $250 million, but that money was on hold when the American president spoke via phone to his Ukrainian counterpart – a conversation in which Trump reportedly pressed Zelenskiy eight times about investigating Biden.

Soon after learning that the military aid was on hold, the editorial board of the Washington Post published a piece alleging that the Republican was effectively trying to “extort” Ukraine, making the $250 million contingent on Kyiv agreeing to participate in Trump’s political scheme.

Soon after, in the face of bipartisan congressional pushback, the Trump administration agreed to release the aid to Ukraine – though according to the Associated Press, the package was worth $390 million, not $250 million. This, of course, came shortly before House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) exposed the existence of the whistleblower’s complaint to the intelligence community’s inspector general.

On Meet the Press yesterday, NBC News’ Chuck Todd asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin where the extra $140 million came from. From the transcript:

MNUCHIN: Well, it was appropriated money that came through the State Department. TODD: [Ukrainians] didn’t know they were getting this money. Is there any indication why they got the money when they did? MNUCHIN: I’m not sure it’s correct for you to say they didn’t know they got the money. – TODD: The president said he was surprised to get it. The president of Ukraine said he was surprised to get an additional $140 million. He said it was a pleasant surprise but that he was surprised. MNUCHIN: I think he was referring to his expectations, as opposed to necessarily a surprise. But you’re getting into details.

Well, yeah, I suppose so. But don’t the details matter?"

Little did I know he’d soon after do it again.

President Donald Trump on Monday defended his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling it a “perfect” discussion, while suggesting he had tied vital military funding for Ukraine to that country’s handling of corruption – which he has alleged Vice President Joe Biden’s family was engaged in there. “We want to make sure that country is honest. It’s very important to talk about corruption. If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” Trump told reporters when asked what he had spoken about with Ukraine’s new president in a July phone call. “It’s very important that, on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption,” he said, moments after telling reporters: “let me just tell you – let me just tell you. What Biden did was wrong.”

Putting aside the fact there’s no evidence whatsoever of Biden having done anything wrong, and the fact that the president has an unfortunate record of making all kinds of false allegations against his perceived political foes, this was the first time the public has heard Trump make a connection between his call with the Ukrainian president, U.S. financial/military aid, and Trump’s electoral scheme.

The original Republican line was that nothing happened. The second line was that Trump may, in fact, have talked to a foreign government about intervening in an American election. And the brand new line is that Trump, while talking to a foreign government about intervening in an American election, referenced the $250 million the United States committed to Ukraine.

Or to put this in broader strokes, we’re witnessing the transition from “the accusation isn’t true” to “the accusation is true, but there’s nothing actually wrong with misdeed in question.”

Around the time the president was moving the ball forward, one of his personal attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, sat down with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo and said he couldn’t be entirely sure Trump didn’t threaten to cut off aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky went along with the Republican’s scheme.

BARTIROMO: Did the president threaten to cut off aid to the Ukraine? GIULIANI: No, no, that was a false story. BARTIROMO: One hundred percent? GIULIANI: Well, I can’t tell you if it’s 100 percent.

Why Team Trump allows Giuliani to appear on television is a bit of a mystery to me."

* The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll – the most closely watched of all Iowa polls – found Elizabeth Warren taking the lead in the first Democratic nominating contest with 22%, followed by Joe Biden at 20%. Bernie Sanders was third with 11%, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg at 9%. Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with 6% support. (Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

* Staff shake-ups on Bernie Sanders’ team continue, with the Vermont senator parting ways with one of his Iowa deputy field directors. Kevin Lata had previously worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 team.

* In keeping with the recent trend, the Alaska Republican Party became the latest state GOP to officially cancel its Republican presidential primary, which had been scheduled for April. Several state parties have taken similar steps to protect Donald Trump from possible embarrassment against his primary rivals.

* As the General Motors strike continues, several Democratic presidential candidates have visited picket lines to show support for members of the United Auto Workers.

* With some evidence of Texas becoming more competitive, Republican officials are making it easier for Green Party candidates to qualify for the ballot, with the obvious hope that the move will undermine Democratic support.

* Though it’s difficult to know if this is a stunt, Cory Booker’s campaign manager wrote in a new memo to staff and supporters that the New Jersey senator’s presidential campaign may come to an end without another $1.7 million before the end of the quarter. (The third quarter ends a week from today.)

* As expected, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D) officially kicked off a primary campaign in Massachusetts against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D) over the weekend.

* And following their recent Twitter argument over which one of them is more closely aligned with Trump’s foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is reportedly taking steps to undermine Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) prospective U.S. Senate campaign."

In reality, of course, it matters very much what Trump discusses with foreign leaders. In fact, literally within minutes of the president making the comment, the Wall Street Journal published a report alleging that Trump “repeatedly pressured” Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son, urging the Ukrainian leader “about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump’s potential 2020 opponent.”

Yesterday, Trump turned to a familiar page in his playbook, effectively confirming that he did, in fact, talk about Biden with the leader of Ukraine, as was alleged. As the Washington Post noted, the president acknowledged this, out loud and on the record, during a brief Q&A with reporters on the White House’s South lawn.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters Sunday morning. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.” Later in Houston, Trump appeared to backtrack, saying, “I don’t even want to mention it, but certainly I’d have the right to” raise Biden’s name with Zelensky….

The Republican added yesterday that there was “no quid pro quo” with the Ukrainian leader, and while it’s unclear whether or not the assertion is true, it’s not exactly the only relevant detail in the scandal. As Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) put it yesterday, “The existence of an explicit quid pro quo – aid for interference – isn’t really the thing. If he demanded a foreign government do his political bidding, that’s when he crossed the critical threshold. No need to overthink this.”

It’s a compelling point. What we know at this point raises the specter of Trump urging a foreign government to look for – or by some measures, manufacture – damaging information Republicans could use to win an American election. We need to know whether there was a quid pro quo, but the absence of one wouldn’t make the scandal disappear.

But what surprised me over the weekend was Trump’s willingness to largely admit what he did.

It was hard not to feel a little pity for the White House’s allies who spent a few days running around telling anyone who’d listen that nothing happened, only to have Trump chop off the limb his supporters had climbed out upon.

And if this dynamic seems familiar, it’s because this president has a curious habit of getting caught up in scandals, only to admit more than he’s supposed to. As The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer noted in a piece late last year, “Donald Trump can’t stop telling on himself.”

In 2017, Trump admitted he fired then-FBI Director James Comey in the hopes of derailing a federal investigation. In 2018: he acknowledged that the pre-election hush money to his alleged former mistresses came directly from him. In 2019, he admitted that he talked to the Ukrainian president about a possible domestic rival.

And if we widen the aperture a bit, in 2016, Trump also made the notorious “Russia, if you’re listening…” comments.

The Washington Post had a report along these lines before Trump’s Sunday morning comments.

“What he’s been saying in public is the kind of thing I used to prosecute people for doing in private,” [Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor] said. Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said Trump’s confounding public behavior – for example, she said, “he says stuff in tweets that seems blatantly illegal” – allows for two competing theories. “Are we giving him too much credit and he’s just so undisciplined that he can’t help but say and tweet these things?” she asked. “Or is he so diabolical that putting it out there is like a jujitsu move?”

For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment.

But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”

Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral.

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS

Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump addressed his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid.

Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations.

Giuliani accused Kiev on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye.

""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?""

While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told The New Yorker that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing.""

Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine.

“Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don’t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.”

All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa poll.

""The whole thing is just, Trump has a style, which is he goes on the offensive when he's under attack.""

TRUMP SLAMS MEDIA AS 'CROOKED AS HELL' AMID UKRAINE PHONE CALL CONTROVERSY

The president’s heated comments have come as congressional Democrats are pressing for a full disclosure of the whistleblower's complaint. Trump acknowledged Monday he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family.

Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

On ""The Five,"" Williams backed the elder Biden's claim Trump is highlighting Hunter Biden's relationship to the natural gas company because he wants to fend off a potential general election challenge.

""I think Joe Biden is right,"" he said. ""Joe Biden sees that he is the target of Trump's ire because Trump sees -- as every poll indicates -- that Biden could 'beat him like a drum'.""

Earlier, Biden used the description in his own critique of the president.

""Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum,"" he told reporters in Iowa over the weekend. ""And, he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to do something to smear me.""

The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

“I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here, in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

“Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Giuliani first said no when Cuomo asked if he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying instead that he asked the country to investigate allegations of election interference by Ukraine for the benefit of Hillary Clinton. He later said he did ask Ukraine to investigate a newly appointed prosecutor. Cuomo replied, “So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?” and Giuliani responded, “Of course I did.” When Cuomo called out the apparent contradiction, Giuliani followed up, “No. I didn't ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme.”

TRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ‘WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,’ TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES

“The no was obviously wrong, I corrected it immediately,” Giuliani said on “Fox News Sunday,” adding, “I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client.”

Hunter Biden had been the subject of an investigation by Ukrainian authorities based on his business dealings with energy company Burisma. Giuliani said the case was dropped only after then-Vice President Biden got the prosecutor fired and then had influence over the selection of his replacement.

“You don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy’s going on,” Giuliani said.

He explained that his original purpose in going to Ukraine was to look into election interference, not the Bidens, but the two matters were “inextricably combined,” so one led to the other.

“This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove.”

Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son, Hunter, in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

The matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower's mid-August complaint, which followed Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Lawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. Trump hinted on Monday that he may release the details of the phone conversation, but said its contents mainly consisted of congratulating the new Ukrainian leader.

WARREN SURGES IN IOWA

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who has recently said he may decline to support President Trump’s reelection bid, tweeted on Sunday that it would be ‘troubling in the extreme’ if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.

In a tweet on Sunday, Romney said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine.""

Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Nunes said the details from the whistleblower complaint still have not been confirmed to Congress. He said the inspector general for the intelligence community met with lawmakers last week, but did not reveal anything.

Nunes said the committee is scheduled to meet soon with the acting director of national intelligence, where he hopes more information will be shared. He claimed the story is playing out in a similar way to the Russia collusion accusations.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., surged ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden in a new poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers released late Saturday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg slipping into a distant third and fourth, respectively.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. By comparison, the Register poll in June showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

J. Ann Selzer, president of pollster Selzer & Co., told the Register the survey represented ""the first major shakeup” of the Iowa race, because: ""It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.""

BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM'

Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June.

Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., rounded out the top five, with six percent of voters saying she was their first choice. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Cory Booker, D-NJ, both received three percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer each received three percent.

The polling shakeup may not be done, as 63 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Harris, Buttigieg and Booker could still benefit from late deciders, as 39 percent, 37 percent and 35 percent of poll respondents said they were still actively considering those respective candidates.

The poll came from a sample size of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 14-18.

The most recent Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide showed Biden with 29 percent support, down six percentage points from his peak in May. Sanders was in second place at 18 percent, up eight percentage points from the previous month's poll, while Warren was on 16 percent, down four points from August."

Devin Nunes predicted on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Joe Biden's campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of newly resurfaced reports about his possible misconduct in Ukraine that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race.""

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren surging ahead of Biden as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June.

Nunes, speaking to anchor Maria Bartiromo, said a whistleblower's allegation that President Trump had acted inappropriately during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will ultimately backfire, and shine a light on Biden's own possible misconduct. CNN later acknowledged that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of the call, and a top Ukrainian official on Saturday defended Trump's actions.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

""These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,"" Nunes said. ""So now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme -- maybe this whistleblower really is not a partisan. We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero.""

Late Sunday, Trump echoed Nunes' comments, and emphasized that Biden recently bragged about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor when he was vice president. At the time, the prosecutor was probing a company closely linked to Biden's son, Hunter.

""Sleepy Joe Biden ... forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""That's the real story!""

Nunes said the ever-deepening schism in the Democratic Party over whether to impeach the president -- highlighted late Saturday when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called it a major ""scandal"" that Democrats hadn't yet voted to impeach -- would help Trump in 2020.

""The more I think that they’re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is reelected,” Nunes added.

There were parallels, Nunes said, with Democrats' ultimately debunked claims that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.

""This has all the hallmarks of the Russia hoax,"" Nunes said. ""Something leaks out. ... and then it's the same reporters that report on it, the same reporters that reported on the Russia hoax. Then you move forward, and what happens? Then supposedly they come and testify -- and the night before they testify, the whistleblower who supposedly doesn't want anybody to know who this person is, or what information they have, well, it's spilled all over the pages of the Washington Post"" the day before Congress was briefed on the matter.

WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE

""Whoever came up with this scheme -- it looks like somebody was trying to deflect what Biden did back in 2015,"" Nunes said. ""This scheme seems to have backfired on Biden. I mean, Biden's already dropping in the polls.""

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe.

At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly boasted about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

Unverified reports circulated on left-leaning media outlets claiming that Trump could have even promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved.

Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" However, the president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE

DNI Inspector General Michael Atkinson said in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

“Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,” Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday.

""At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower’s full complaint to the Committee,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Sunday afternoon. ""We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.""

Pelosi also seemingly threatened that she would back impeachment if her demands were not met, in a potentially major shift to her wait-and-see approach thus far: ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine. The president has said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

“I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

“Well, son of a b-tch, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats, and that they have been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department.

A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump told Fox News that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed they would be reviewed by the DOJ.

Additionally, attention focused anew on President Obama's hot-mic comment to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a nuclear disarmament summit in March 2012, in which Obama was overheard saying he would have more ""flexibility"" to negotiate with Russia after the November 2012 election.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power.""

“Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden told reporters in Iowa.

But Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about it.

“And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Of course you spoke to your son!”

Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.""

Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted.

Giuliani did not provide how he learned about the purported transaction but said prosecutors were stonewalled at the time when they inquired about the sum.

""[Hunter] Biden’s boss had stolen $5b from Ukraine and was a fugitive. Did Obama know? Did he approve?""

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump asked his Ukranian counterpart to investigate Hunter Biden, who had a key role in a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. Hunter Biden has not been accused of wrongdoing during his time at the company, where he made $50,000 a month as a member of the board of directors, according to The New York Times. Up until his role on the board, Hunter Biden had no experience in Ukraine, the Times reported.

At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly boasted about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

Trump on Sunday appeared to confirm that he spoke about Joe Biden with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but insisted that the call was routine. Democrats seized on his admission and some renewed calls for his impeachment. Political observers raised questions as to why Trump would allow himself to get into a position that it could even appear like he is seeking help from a foreign power to achieve political ends.

Giuliani, like many Trump supporters, stressed that the story is not the phone calls, rather the crony capitalism on display where the son of a sitting vice president could make millions working on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Trump accused Joe Biden of dishonesty in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling The New Yorker magazine that they spoke “just once” about it.

Trump heads into three-day visit to the United Nations, will host summit on religious freedom

President Trump heads into a three-day visit to the United Nations in New York City starting on Monday facing questions over several issues: whether he sought help from Ukraine to damage potential 2020 presidential election opponent Joe Biden, growing tension with Iran, the U.S.-China trade war, a weakened global economy, stalled nuclear negotiations with North Korea and the future of Brexit.

Trump will host a summit Monday on religious freedom. His speech will present the U.S. as an alternative to authoritarianism and underline his ""commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedom,"" administration officials said Friday during a briefing call, according to Axios. Trump will not attend a U.N. meeting Monday on climate change. On Tuesday, Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 16 other world leaders will attend a U.N. General Assembly meeting.

Nunes says whistleblower controversy could have unintended casualty: Joe Biden's 2020 campaign

On Sunday, Trump addressed reports that a whistleblower complaint may have accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, and insisted that there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with the substance of the discussion.

The president reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests, but he did point fingers at Biden.

The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. In the past, Joe Biden has said the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to his son's case. Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke “just once” about it.

In an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the whistleblower complaint will have unintended consequences and shine light on Joe Biden's own misconduct - and ultimately end his 2020 campaign.

Just hours after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump amounted to a major ""national scandal,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching because of the reported whistleblower complaint against the president. Pelosi, who has long resisted calls to impeach Trump because the move would imperil the electability of moderate Democrats in the House, the whistleblower who alleged Trump acted improperly in his phone call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided.

Blackface scandal damages Trudeau at polls as he vows lower taxes, cellphone costs

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday worked to start putting last week’s blackface scandal behind him and focused on policies he said he’d pursue if re-elected, including lower cellphone costs and a middle-class tax cut, according to reports. However, the scandal may have torpedoed his lead in the polls.

Trudeau apologized several times for the multiple images that emerged last week showing him in blackface at different parties and events while he was in his teens and 20s. But pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research told Reuters that polls have shifted and the gap between his campaign and the opposition Conservatives has narrowed. Graves said he will release the poll numbers later this week, but told the news outlet that Trudeau’s lead has “evaporated almost overnight.”

Pompeo's comments came in response to reports that President Trump may have leaned on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asking him to investigate possible criminal acts committed by Biden's son, Hunter.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump asked Zelenskiy to look into Biden's son for his role in a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor, as part of a corruption case.

Pompeo said Trump has had a strong relationship with Ukranian leaders and continually has been an ally and source of support for their government, long before the whistleblower story broke.

""I’ve watched the president engage with the Ukrainian leadership, I’ve listened to conversations,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""I remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapons systems to Ukraine. This president’s chosen to do that... three times so that the Ukrainian people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast Ukraine.""

For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate 2020 hopeful Joe Biden’s family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“Thank goodness Jonathan Karl is here,” co-host Whoopi Goldberg said after airing video of Trump’s explanation of the call. “What just happened?”

Karl then explained that Trump admitted he talked about Biden directly with the Ukrainian president in July during a time that the United States was withholding aid money that Congress had already approved.

“We don’t know, was he pressuring?… was he suggesting?, we don’t know any of that,” Karl said before citing a Wall Street Journal report that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son.

Karl then said there are people on Trump’s team urging him to release the transcript of the now-infamous phone call. Karl also said that if Joe Biden's son, Hunter, weren’t politically connected then he probably wouldn’t have been in a position to profit from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board.

“Hunter Biden, as far as I know, doesn’t have a lot of experience with Ukraine, I think if his name were Hunter Smith he probably wouldn’t have been getting paid,” Karl said.

Co-host Meghan McCain then pointed out that reporters act like “the end of the world is coming” on a regular basis and asked Karl why this latest story was any different.

“I think that this is significant and this is a little bit different and very easy to understand. You have what the president himself has already acknowledged, which is even if there was no quid pro quo, even if he wasn’t holding that aid over the head of the president of Ukraine, merely bringing up your political opponent in a conversation with a newly elected president, any president of a foreign country, is going to be seen as problematic,” Karl said.

“When you’re in the primary... the tug to the left is inexorable and it just pulls them all, including now Biden who is running to the left,” Fleischer told “The Daily Briefing” with Dana Perino.

The comments came after Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she doesn't think former Vice President Joe Biden can be the progressive leader she believes the party needs heading into the 2020 presidential election, against President Trump.

ILHAN OMAR REFUSES TO BACK BIDEN, SAYS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ISN'T RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD DEMS IN 2020

Omar addressed her concerns about Biden in a new interview with The Guardian, after appearing at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday. She said the former vice president lacked the excitement necessary to inspire long-lasting change.

""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country. And I would say he is not one of them,"" she said.

IN RESURFACED INTERVIEW, ILHAN OMAR ANSWERS QUESTION ON 'JIHADIST TERRORISM' BY SAYING AMERICANS SHOULD BE 'MORE FEARFUL OF WHITE MEN'

“Because of Trump, no one is noticing how far to the left the Democratic Party is going and it’s just accelerated, even more as we approach 2020.”

Fleischer said that the number of Democrats who identify as liberal has surged inside the party but the growing efforts to appeal to those voters creates a risk of potentially turning suburban women and others to the Republican camp.

Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

“I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,” Trump said outside the White House before departing for Houston. “There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,” he later added.

Trump did point fingers at Biden, however. The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke “just once” about it.

“And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said Sunday. “Of course you spoke to your son!”

When asked about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump said it had nothing to do with the Biden family.

""Because I want Germany, and I want France, and I want the European Union to put up money,"" Trump said. ""And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid to the best of my knowledge.""

BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., doubted that Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy was innocent.

""Well if that’s the case, then why doesn’t the president simply release the transcript of that call?” Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Schiff also challenged Trump to allow the release of the whistleblower complaint, accusing Trump of not wanting to see either one.

The Democratic congressman has long been a vocal critic of the president but has not been among those calling for his impeachment. Schiff said that may change in light of the reports of Trump's conversation with Ukraine.

""If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.”

Giuliani has acknowledged that he was involved in investigating Hunter Biden, but claimed that his original goal was to investigate ties between Ukraine and Democrats related to the 2016 election. He denied that he was specifically out to get Biden.

“What they’re trying to say is I went there on a political mission to get Joe Biden in trouble,” Giuliani told “Fox News Sunday,” calling such a claim “ridiculous.”

Giuliani said that the suspicion of Biden’s wrongdoing related to his son’s case was “inextricably linked” to what he had already been investigating related to the Democratic Party.

“This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove,” Giuliani said.

Trump said he would be amenable to Giuliani discussing the matter before Congress.

“I would have no problem,” the president said. “Rudy’s a straight shooter, and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people when it comes to Ukraine.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also fielded questions about Ukraine on “Fox News Sunday,” but declined to get into specifics, only stating that Trump’s discussions with world leaders “have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful.”

ROBERTS: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The war of words over the Saudi oil attacks, which the United States blames on Iran, has turned into action, the Pentagon announcing it will send more troops to the region to boost security for allies and President Trump approving new sanctions on Iran's central bank.

But the president also signaling he is not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike, which the Iranian regime has declared would mean all-out war. In a moment, we'll speak with the president's top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, who just returned from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.

But first, Kevin Corke is traveling with the president, who has a rally today in Houston with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Kevin, good morning.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: John, good day to be with you.

Right. We'll have more on that rally coming up in just a few moments, but by any measure, John, the Iranians are suffering greatly under this latest round of U.S. sanctions, just one of many weapons in the U.S. arsenal as it considers what to do next about Iran's Saudi attack.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TRUMP: We have just sanction the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions.

CORKE: We'll see what happens, a familiar refrain from President Trump. When asked with the U.S. might do next to respond to Iran's attacks on Saudi oil fields. Iran denies it was behind those attacks. In addition to more sanctions, the president has authorized sending a battery of U.S. forces to the region at Saudi request.

ESPER: As the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary.

CORKE: The strikes, which Washington says it can prove came from Iran, have pushed the regent to the brink.

For its part, Tehran is threatening to escalate the violence should the U.S. or the Saudis attack even in limited form.

MAJOR GENERAL HOSSEIN SALAMI, IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER: A limited invasion will not remain limited. We hand down and punish. We have proven it before.

CORKE: That warning comes under day that saw the regime put its military capabilities on display, with a series of parades to mark the 39th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war and comes months after the Iranians downed and a American surveillance drone in international airspace.

This in a week that will see a gathering of world leaders at United Nations General Assembly in New York where Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he'll present a Gulf security plan.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: All this as the U.S. welcomes another world leader. This time it's Narendra Modi, as you mentioned, the prime minister of India. He's here for a ""Howdy, Modi"" Texas rally with President Trump. It is set to be the largest American audience to see a foreign leader speak other than the pope.

We'll bring it to you throughout the day. But for now, thank you.

ROBERTS: OK, Kevin Corke, thanks very much.

The president with an afternoon event with Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia as well.

Kevin, we'll see you soon. Thanks.

Joining me now from New York is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Mr. Secretary, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

POMPEO: John, it's great to be with you.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, earlier in the week, you said of the attack against the Saudi oil facilities that it was, quote, an act of war, and you said that Iran was definitely behind it. When you say something is an act of war, does that demand ultimately a military response?

POMPEO: Well, John, our mission set has been very clear. President Trump would like to have a diplomatic solution, that's the task that's in front of us. That's what we've been aiming for for a little over two years now with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime.

And, John, you know the history. Forty years of terror from Iran. It's an anti-Semitic set of leaders that would like to wipe Israel and America from the face of the earth. Our mission set is to avoid war.

You saw what Secretary Esper announced on Friday, we're putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense, with our objective to be very clear, to support the Iranian people so that they can get this regime to cease behaving in a way that is so destructive not only to their own country, but to the entire Middle East.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, there are reports this morning that Houthi militants in Yemen have warned both Saudi Arabia and the United States that Iran may be planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. Is that true?

POMPEO: So, I've certainly seen that reporting and I won't talk about American intelligence and what we know. But suffice it to say, we are consistently concerned that Iran will continue to behave in the way that it has now for 40 years, it did so before the JCPOA, it did so during the JCPOA, and they continue to act in ways that are inconsistent with our obligations.

I'm here this week at the United Nations. I traveled to Jeddah and to Abu Dhabi this week.

The whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor. They are the evil force in the region. They are destabilizing in the Middle East, and I hope this week here in New York, the whole world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership that this behavior is simply unacceptable.

ROBERTS: That may be a tough hill to climb though, yes?

POMPEO: I think there's a handful of countries that are actually supportive of Iran and what Iran is doing are certainly unwilling to push back. But it's the case; this is the world's responsibility to respond from these state-on-state acts of war that took place in Saudi Arabia this past week.

ROBERTS: If Iran were to launch, in the middle of all of this, another attack against Saudi Arabia, would the United States have any other option but to respond militarily?

POMPEO: John, unlike the previous administration, we try -- we do our best to avoid talking about what we will do, but the American people should know, just like the Iranian people should know, America is prepared to respond in ways that are consistent with America's national security interests.

Our first aim, of course, is to keep the American people safe and secure, and part of that is to make sure that we have all the things in place so that we can do that.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, many military and foreign policy experts, even members of the president's own support group, believe that in calling off the retaliatory strike in response to that drone shoot-down at the last minute, the president signaled to Iran that there are no consequences for its malign activities. What do you say to that criticism?

POMPEO: Well, first of all, there have been consequences, real consequences. The Iranian economy will shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year in front of us, and we took a handful of actions, some of which I can't talk about here. So there were certainly consequences.

The Iranians aren't looking for a green light. The Iranians have behaved poorly for 40 years. And so, it's not the case that any particular response has allowed the Iranians to think they have freedom to move about the cabin (ph).

I assure you of this: the Iranian leadership understands four-square that President Trump will take appropriate action and impose appropriate costs on Iran if they continue to act in the way that they've done over these past now 40 years.

ROBERTS: You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, at the beginning of this, the sanctions that President Trump put on Iran. On Friday, he said that there were sanctions at the highest level. If these sanctions don't work, what's next? What's left?

POMPEO: Well, they are working, John. The toughest of the sanctions, the essential ban on the -- Iran's ability to sell its crude oil around the world took effect only --

(CROSSTALK)

POMPEO: -- in May of this year.

ROBERTS: But what I mean is if they don't work -- if they don't work to bring Iran to the table.

POMPEO: As Secretary Esper said on Friday night, we're prepared to act in ways that are necessary in order to achieve the outcome President Trump has very clearly laid out. I talked about it a year ago, in May. We know what the objectives are. We simply want Iran to behave like a normal nation.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, is it possible that if there were a retaliatory military strike against Iran, that it would be able to be contained, or would it, as Javad Zarif and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Council have warned, erupt into all-out conflagration in the Middle East, which would likely involve U.S. bases in the region, would likely also possibly involve Israel?

POMPEO: We're certainly deeply aware of the risks. That's why we want to resolve this in a way that doesn't resort to kinetic action, if it's at all possible to achieve that.

But as for Zarif, I don't know why nobody listens to him. He has nothing to do with Iranian foreign policy. He lies all the time.

We need to make sure that we do the right things to protect and secure America and do our best to provide the resources to the Emirates and the Saudis, who I had a chance to speak to this week on my trip, so that they have increased capability to defend themselves and their own people. And when we -- when we do those things, I'm confident that we will have set the conditions for deterrence. And if that deterrence should continue to fail, I'm also confident President Trump will take the actions that are necessary.

ROBERTS: All right. We will see what happens at the United Nations General Assembly this week. I'll see you there later on today.

Let's switch to this whistleblower complaint. We still don't know the exact substance of the complaint but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And we have heard from reporting in ""The Wall Street Journal"" that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.

To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials?

POMPEO: Well, John, you're asking me to comment on an I.C. (ph) report I haven't seen and some reporting -- I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever.

As for appropriate action, I've watched the president engage with the Ukrainian leadership. I listened to conversations. I remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapon systems to Ukraine. This president has chosen to do that not once, not twice, but now three times, so that the Ukraine people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast Ukraine.

You remember, it was the previous administration that allowed Vladimir Putin to take one fifth of the Ukrainian country.

We're going to see President Zelensky this week. I do hope -- I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, if he had a conflict of interest or entered (ph) -- or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that.

ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, you said that you have not seen the complaint, not many people have. I assume, though, that you have seen a transcript of the telephone call that the president had with Zelensky.

Should a transcript of that be released to clear the air?

POMPEO: I'll ultimately leave that to the White House. But you know, John, those are private conversations between world leaders, and it's -- it's not often that those are released. And when they're done, it's done when the White House deems it appropriate. And I'll leave whether that should be released to them.

ROBERTS: Again, I assume that you've seen the transcript. Is it as described in ""The Wall Street Journal""?

POMPEO: You know, I haven't seen ""The Wall Street Journal"" piece, John. There's a lot going on in the world.

ROBERTS: Right.

The whistleblower complaint reportedly alleges a quid pro quo or a promise made to a foreign leader. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports there was no evidence of a quid pro quo in that call with Zelensky. Was there a quid pro quo -- was there a request to investigate Biden and/or his son? And was that linked to a promise of aid?

POMPEO: John, I've watched this president evaluate how and when and to the extent we should provide support to Ukraine, both defense assistance and other foreign assistance, we've been at the center of that.

Those conversations have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful, and 100 percent ensuring that the American taxpayers were protected, that we put those resources to good use and we've got good outcomes in Ukraine when we used American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukrainian leadership -- every single time, John.

ROBERTS: If there was a quid pro quo, would that be a problem?

POMPEO: John, you're asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report I haven't seen. Come on.

ROBERTS: I mean, if an American leader says to a foreign leader, we will do this and it might have something to do with USA, in exchange for this, is that a problem?

POMPEO: John, it's the case we have foreign assistance that is evaluated against American objectives consistently. It's my duty to protect America by making sure that when foreign assistance is provided to countries, that America benefit from that. And it's completely appropriate to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are used appropriately.

ROBERTS: Do believe that there should be an investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian gas company?

POMPEO: I'll leave that to others, but I certainly think it's appropriate if there's concerns and there's enough information to justify looking into it. The American people deserve to know if that was handled in an appropriate way by Vice President Biden.

ROBERTS: Just before we go, Mr. Secretary, are you ruling out a run for the Senate from Kansas next year?

POMPEO: I've said the same thing, John, for a long time. As long as President Trump is going to have me as secretary of state, which I hope is a long time, that's what I'm going to continue to do.

ROBERTS: I'm sure he wants you as secretary of state for a long time. I'm just wondering if you still have aspirations for the Senate.

POMPEO: It's what I want to do, too. I want to be President Trump's secretary of state.

ROBERTS: All right. Secretary Pompeo, we'll see you later on in New York.

POMPEO: Thank you, sir.

ROBERTS: Thanks for joining us.

We'll be following all the action, of course, at the United Nations General Assembly next week.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: Interactions between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and the president of Ukraine are under scrutiny following reports of a whistle- blower complaint, claiming that the president urged the Ukrainian to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially influencing the 2020 race.

Joining me here live in Washington to talk more about this is Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.

Rudy, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday.""

RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How are you? How are you, John?

ROBERTS: I'm good. Thanks for joining us.

Let's clear something up, first of all.

GIULIANI: Sure.

ROBERTS: Let's dial the clock back to Thursday, play this exchange between you and Chris Cuomo on CNN, in which you appeared to at first say you didn't ask Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and/or his son, and then you seemed to change her mind.

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: Listen. Listen here.

CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Did you to ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?

GIULIANI: No.

Actually, I didn't.

CUOMO: You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden...

GIULIANI: The only thing I asked about Joe Biden...

CUOMO: ... and his role with the prosecutor?

GIULIANI: ... is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed...

CUOMO: Right.

GIULIANI: ... dismissed the case against AntAC.

CUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?

GIULIANI: Of course I did.

CUOMO: You just said you didn't.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: All right, so which is it? Did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask Ukraine to look into it or not?

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: I clarified it immediately.

ROBERTS: All right.

GIULIANI: He said to me, did you ever talk about Joe Biden? I said no. Then I said, I did say that you should investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.

The no was obviously wrong. I corrected it immediately.

ROBERTS:

GIULIANI: I corrected it before he corrected it.

The reality is, the distinction is this. What they are trying to say is, I went there for a political mission to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble.

Ridiculous.

I went there as a lawyer defending his client. I -- I have known about this for five months. I have been trying to get people to cover this for five months. So, I knew it would be very, very hard to get this out.

And what I'm talking about, this, it's Ukrainian collusion, which was large, significant, and proven with Hillary Clinton, with the Democratic National Committee, a woman named Chalupa, with the ambassador, with an FBI agent who's now been hired by George Soros who was funding a lot of it.

When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor, who Biden approved -- you don't get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country, unless something fishy is going on.

The new prosecutor dropped the case, not just on Biden's kid and the crooked company that Biden's kid work for, Burisma. That was done as a matter of record in October of 2016, after the guy got tanked.

He also dropped the case on George Soros' company called AntAC. AntAC is the company where there's documentary evidence that they were producing false information about Trump, about Biden. Fusion GPS was there.

Go back and listen to Nellie Ohr's testimony. Nellie Ohr says that there was a lot of contract between Democrats and the Ukraine.

Well, I have all the contacts. And, John, when the rest of this comes out, and when you look at China and the $1.5 billion that the -- that the Biden family took out of China while that guy was negotiating for us, this will be a lot bigger than Spiro Agnew.

They have fallen into a trap.

ROBERTS: So, you went over there to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election?

GIULIANI: Yes. And if I can't do that, I can't defend a client.

I...

ROBERTS: All right, so when did this morph into an investigation of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?

And is it appropriate for you, as a representative of the president, to be going to Ukraine and finding dirt on Joe Biden and/or his son to use politically in 2020?

GIULIANI: Well, that's the way you characterize it. It's certainly appropriate...

ROBERTS: That's the way it appears to line up.

GIULIANI: No, it doesn't.

ROBERTS: You went there for one thing, you found out something else, and that's what you have been digging on this.

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: That's the way the pro-Biden media lines it up.

This began with someone coming to me saying, this information can clear your client about the corruption in Ukraine between the Ukraine, the Democratic Party, the ambassador, and the FBI agent who investigated the case.

(CROSSTALK)

ROBERTS: But it then -- but then it morphs into Biden.

GIULIANI: And -- inextricably combined, because Biden had the guy fired, Shokin.

By the way, his statement is on record. The lazy press could go read it. They don't have to listen to me. There are three videotapes of prosecutors on record, available on here, that nobody has covered for five months, because this town protects Joe Biden.

His family has been taking money from his public office for years, $1.5 billion from China, when our vice president is supposed to be impartially and independently negotiating for us? And the kid, he takes him on Air Force Two to China, and the kid...

ROBERTS: That was in 2013.

GIULIANI: Yes.

And the kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict. China didn't give $1.5 billion to his kid, Biden's kid, a recovering drug addict, Kerry's stepson, and Whitey Bulger's nephew.

Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up on you. Can you imagine...

ROBERTS: This is a company called Rosemont Seneca.

Let me just -- let me just come back, if I could.

GIULIANI: You got to stop for a second.

Whitey Bulger's nephew?

ROBERTS: Let me just stop for a second.

GIULIANI: One-point-five billion coming from China, when our vice president...

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Mr. Mayor...

GIULIANI: That doesn't shock you?

ROBERTS: ... let me stop for a second, because...

GIULIANI: I mean, how far have we deteriorated?

ROBERTS: Let me stop for a second, because we are throwing around a lot of Ukrainian names that people don't know about.

GIULIANI: Well, that's because nobody would ever cover this.

ROBERTS: Viktor Shokin was a prosecutor back when Biden was the vice president.

He was looking into Burisma Holdings...

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: ... of which Hunter Biden was on the board of directors.

GIULIANI: Correct.

ROBERTS: There were some allegations that there was some monkey business going on with Burisma.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Joe Biden -- Joe Biden -- Joe Biden went over to Ukraine in 2016...

GIULIANI: Right.

ROBERTS: ... and said that, I'm going to withhold more than a billion dollars in loan guarantees unless you fire this prosecutor.

Joe Biden talked about that in 2018. Let's roll that.

GIULIANI: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here.

And I think it was, what, six hours. I look at it. I said, we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: But Shokin had been heavily criticized for corruption.

And it was the United States and a number of other Western countries who said...

GIULIANI: So is everybody in the Ukraine.

ROBERTS: ... he needs to go.

GIULIANI: More relevant...

ROBERTS: So, was this tied to Hunter Biden, or was this the United States saying, you have got a bad actor there, because he was accused of corruption in his office? And other countries in the West were saying he needs to go as well.

GIULIANI: What does it matter, if the -- if the son is under investigation? He didn't disclose that.

Doesn't the thing strike you? I mean, it is so warped. Doesn't it strike you as strange that he would tell that story and not mention to you that his son's company was the major defendant in the investigation, the guy who was carrying on?

Do you -- I happen to know -- and I have seen the records -- do you know why he was fired? Do you know how the kid was paid? Three million dollars goes from Ukraine to Cyprus -- I'm sorry -- Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, Cyprus to Rosemont Seneca.

I have seen each one of the wires.

When that prosecutor, Shokin, subpoenaed Cyprus, he got a response. I have the record. They gave him all the information, but two people, Hunter Biden and John Kerry's stepson -- I'm sorry -- John Kerry's speechwriter, who was the best friend of his stepson.

ROBERTS: The prosecutor who followed..

GIULIANI: When that happened, Joe Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter.

And he went over there and he got him fired. And the next day, people showed up. And they started on getting the case for the kid dismissed, as well as the case for Soros. And that's what brings me into it.

ROBERTS: Now, the prosecutor -- the prosecutor...

GIULIANI: No, you got to let me finish.

ROBERTS: OK.

GIULIANI: He said, I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden.

Do you know, when I found out about Joe Biden, do know what I told my colleague? They are going to cover this up.

Too bad Biden is involved in this. I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion. The minute I say Biden, that Washington press corps is going to go nuts. They have been covering up for years, China, plagiarism.

ROBERTS: OK. OK. All right.

Now you're straying into areas of opinion, as opposed to fact.

GIULIANI: No, I'm not. I'm straying into what is wrong with us today and the unfairness.

ROBERTS: We need to point out -- we need to point out that Yuriy Lutsenko, who was the prosecutor who was appointed after Shokin was fire...

GIULIANI: Approved by...

ROBERTS: ... resurrected, reanimated the case, and found that Hunter Biden was, in fact, paid millions of dollars.

But Lutsenko said that the board of Burisma was able to pay a board member whatever they wanted, and he didn't see anything wrong with that.

GIULIANI: John, how is the coverage so distorted?

ROBERTS: I'm just pointing out a fact.

GIULIANI: If you did any work, you would find out Lutsenko is the prosecutor that Biden put in.

There's a newspaper article in which Biden approves Lutsenko when he's appointed. Doesn't that strike you as odd, that the vice president would approve a particular prosecutor?

Did you ever bother to look?

(CROSSTALK)

GIULIANI: Let me finish.

ROBERTS: One other point we need to make here before we go.

GIULIANI: No, no, no, I want answer another question unless you let me finish. This is really unfair.

These are very important things that have been covered up for years to protect slimy Joe.

The reality is that there are three other prosecutors where all you have to do is go online, three others, that say that this was done precisely to get rid of Biden, to cover up Hunter, and to cover up Soros.

I will give you their names. One of them is Kulik, Konstantin Kulik. The other is Shokin himself. And the third one is a prosecutor by the name of Inazdir (ph).

They are present officials. Three of them were officials. One is still an official of the Ukrainian government.

If you bothered to look, you could listen to them on tape telling you that. Now, they may all be lying, but Lutsenko may be lying also. But it's 3-1.

ROBERTS: One more point we got to make.

GIULIANI: And Lutsenko is Biden's chosen prosecutor.

ROBERTS: OK. You have made your point.

One more point to make we need to make.

GIULIANI: You will also find there is a great deal of suspicion.

ROBERTS: Yes, Joe Biden yesterday told our Peter -- Joe Biden told our Peter Doocy yesterday that he never discussed overseas business with his son Hunter.

GIULIANI: Do you believe that?

ROBERTS: I don't know. Do you believe that?

GIULIANI: I'm flying my son to China. How long is the flight to China?

ROBERTS: Its a while.

GIULIANI: Fifteen hours, 16 hours, 17?

I'm flying my son to China on Air Force Two. I'm going to negotiate with the Chinese to help America. My son is going there to negotiate to help the Biden family.

When he comes back, and eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict, somebody connected to the vice president of the United States and somebody connected to the biggest gangster in America.

Wait a second. The son doesn't say to him, I got a billion dollars? By the way, you see what Joe said? It's contradicted by the son. The son said, I talked to my father about it.

How about this? There was an article on December 9 of 2015 in ""The New York Times"" raising holy hell about Biden's son being on the board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine and how strange it looked.

I don't know if Joe reads the newspapers, but somebody must have read that to him.

And, finally, if Joe didn't know what his son was doing abroad, how may conflicts are there? This guy was flying blind? I don't know. Did he get money from Russia? Did he get money from Cuba? Was he doing business in Venezuela?

You're telling me that the vice president of the United States was there for eight years. His son is going around the world taking millions from some adversary of the United States.

ROBERTS: Yes.

GIULIANI: Don't say yes. This is important.

ROBERTS: No, no, we have -- I'm saying we have got to go.

GIULIANI: This is about the only time I have gotten to point out a tremendously large scandal that affects the American people.

And it's your job to do it, not just mine. I'm doing it to defend my client.

ROBERTS: We are out of time.

GIULIANI: But you're telling me that he had no system with his son to check on conflicts? So we know of two.

We know there's a big conflict with Ukraine. We know there is a big conflict with China. Since Joe says and is apparently selling the swamp media on the fact that he didn't know, well, Joe, how many more conflicts are there? Venezuela? Cuba?

ROBERTS: You have mentioned that.

We have got to leave it. Mr. Mayor, we are...

GIULIANI: One-point-five billion is enough for most people to get investigated.

ROBERTS: We are out of time for this morning, but, clearly, we are going to keep looking into this.

GIULIANI: And this is going to get bigger and bigger. And everything I say, I can prove.

ROBERTS: Rudy, thanks so much for being with us.

GIULIANI: Take me on.

ROBERTS: All right. Appreciate it.

Coming up, we will get reaction to the president's Iran policy with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Ben Cardin joins us here next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: Coming up, President Trump authorizes new economic penalties on Iran.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We have just sanctioned the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the move will bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: As the United States boosts its defenses in the Middle East after blaming Iran for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Islamic regime says it's ready for any scenario.

Joining me here in Washington, Senator Ben Cardin, a top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator, welcome back to “Fox News Sunday.”

SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD: John, it's great to be with you. Thank you.

ROBERTS: So the U.S. is sending more troops and defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to counter the threat coming from Iran.

Your thoughts about sending more men and material there?

CARDIN: John, this is a very dangerous situation. There could easily be a miscalculation. The temperature couldn't be harder between the United States and Iran.

Our job is to isolate Iran. Iran is the bad actor. And what the president needs to do is get an international coalition to continue to work against Iran's support of terrorism. The challenge, of course, is, because, as the United States has been isolated when the president withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. So we're having difficulty with our European allies to get the type of support we need, but we have to isolate Iran.

ROBERTS: There are reports that -- from the Houthis apparently to Saudi Arabia and to the United States, I don't know if you saw my question to the secretary of state, that Iran is planning another attack in Saudi Arabia.

If Iran were, in the middle of all of this, launch another attack at Saudi Arabia, would that demand a military response?

CARDIN: There's really not a military solution to the problem of Iran. We need to make diplomacy work. Clearly there could be a miscalculation. We have to defend ourselves, no question about that, but we have to reduce the temp -- where we are, where we could have this miscalculation.

It would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in Iran. It will have consequences throughout the entire region. It's not in our national security interests.

ROBERTS: All right, so we've got the United States ramping up sanctions on Iran, withdrawing from the JCPOA, which you yourself didn't -- didn't vote for. And Iran is countering by shooting down American drones, firing missiles and launching drones at Saudi oil facilities. I mean they are in a shooting war. So is -- is this -- is this -- I mean if you let somebody fire at you and you don't shoot back, are you not showing weakness?

CARDIN: Well, John, here -- here's the fault of the Trump policies. Before we withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreements, there were conversations with the Europeans about strengthening the sanctions against Iran for the non- nuclear violations. We could have had that international support and tightens the economic pressure against Iran, but still stay within the nuclear agreement. By pulling out of the nuclear agreement, it's the view of Europe that this is an American problem rather than an international problem.

ROBERTS: But -- but you know the arguments, this president said, look, it covers the nuclear, but it -- there's a sunset clause to it of a decade, which isn't much when you look at, you know, the history of nuclear development. But it also does not do anything to reign in Iran's malign activities.

I pointed out, you yourself did not vote for the JCPOA because you were worried about future uranium enrichment.

So why stay in a bad deal?

CARDIN: No, I agree with that analysis, but the way to fix it is to work with Europe, work with our partners to deal with the non-nuclear violations, strengths the sanctions against Iran on the non-nuclear side, make sure they stay in compliance with the nuclear obligations. They were in compliance with the nuclear obligations when the United States pulled out.

The bottom line is, we made -- the -- we isolated the United States rather than isolating Iran, and Iran is the bad actor. There's no question about it. We don't know what they're going to do, but we certainly need the support of our international partners.

ROBERTS: But how serious is Iran about the JCPOA? The United States pulled out. There is still five signatories to it, yet Iran is violating the agreement.

CARDIN: Well, the issue is, Iran -- we don't know how Iran's calculating this, but we do know that the U.S. sanctions is having a major impact on their economy. So the benefits they thought they were going to get under the nuclear agreement, they're no longer getting.

ROBERTS: Right.

CARDIN: That's causing them to recalculate.

ROBERTS: For the moment, President Trump says he's showing restraint about Iran. He's got people like Secretary Pompeo saying it's an act of war. Others are pointing fingers, like Mark Esper and Pompeo at Iran. The president saying, I'm going to sit back and wait and see how this plays out. Listen to what he said in the Oval Office the other day.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think the strong person's approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint. Much easier to do it the -- the other way. It's much easier. And Iran knows, if they misbehave, they're on borrowed time.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: So you've got the president's aides on the one hand saying, act of war, Iran's responsible. The president saying, I'm waiting and seeing her. He's leaving the door open to negotiation, even amidst all this tough talk.

Could that be a good strategy to try to bring them to the table?

CARDIN: I think it's an important week with all the world leaders -- most of the world leaders meeting up in New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations.

I hope that we can get that type of unity with the international community in regards to Iran so that the military option is not the right option. I agree with Secretary Pompeo that diplomacy should be the way we proceed. I agree with that.

And hopefully this week we can get the type of support in New York to make a difference in the calculation by Iran so that they stop these horrible things.

What they're doing is horrible. We can't let them continue to do that.

ROBERTS: Let me switch to this intelligence committee inspector general whistle-blower report. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported on Friday that the president had a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in which he about eight times pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Joe Biden.

The Ukrainian foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said today, quote, I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. So you have Democrats on the one side calling for the president's impeachment over this, and then you have the Ukrainian foreign minister saying, I don't see any pressure.

CARDIN: I think we need to know what happened. The allegations are that the president used the power of his office for partisan political purposes, jeopardizing the national security of the United States by withholding aid to Ukraine, one of our key, strategic partners. That --

ROBERTS: Nobody's made the connection about aid yet. We don't even know what this thing's about.

CARDIN: We -- we -- at least there's been some reports that there was $250 million that were held up, ultimately was released --

ROBERTS: I think people have connected the dots, but I don't think we've got anything really to back that up.

CARDIN: Well, that's what -- let's find out. Let's -- let's find -- let's have transparency here. We can easily find that out if information about those phone calls would be released and we could see exactly what's involved. But the president has chosen, at least to date, not to release that information.

These are serious allegations. Let's find out.

I -- I -- I don't want to reach a conclusion. I'm just suggesting to you that an allegation that the president used his political office for partisan reasons, jeopardizing our national security, we need to get to the facts.

ROBERTS: Is there a case to be made to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's -- their involvement in Ukraine? Let's listen to what the president said and what Joe Biden said the other day.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country less a certain prosecutor is taken off the case.

BIDEN: Not one single, credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion. Not one single one. And so I have no comment except the president should start to (INAUDIBLE).

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: Now, in fact, a lot of credible news organizations, including ""The New York Times,"" have been looking into this. Ken Vogel, who's the reporter who wrote about it -- and here's the article -- back in May said on Friday that there's -- this could be a significant issue for Joe Biden and that there's more there.

CARDIN: Well -- well, John, I know what happened in 2015 with the prosecutor. The international community needed that prosecutor to leave. Congress wanted that prosecutor to leave. Corruption was the center problem we had with Ukraine, maintaining our coalition against Russia for -- with sanctions. And we had to deal with the corrupt issues and the prosecutor was in the center of that. So that -- that was a policy that we wanted to implement.

Joe Biden's issue has been looked at for a long time. There's been findings that there is no improper involvement. This is a distraction by the president of the United States to distract from his most recent situation.

ROBERTS: You don't want to prejudge the situation with the president and his whistle-blower, but a lot of your Democratic colleagues are already making the leap to impeachment.

Is that going too far?

CARDIN: I -- I think you need to get the facts. I don't think you should -- you know, the impeachment process is a way in which Congress exercises its responsibility, checks and balances in our system. But you can't act on that type of a remedy until you have the facts. So let's get the facts first.

ROBERTS: Senator Cardin, always good to see you.

CARDIN: Nice to be with you.

ROBERTS: Thanks so much for coming in.

Coming up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the prospects of a showdown between the United States and Iran.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's abundantly clear and there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks. It was Iran.

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What would be the consequence of an American or a Saudi military strike on Iran now?

MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: An all-out war.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: The top diplomats from this country and Iran in a war of words this week over the fallout from the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil industry.

And its time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg for ""The National Review,"" Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, Susan Page of ""USA Today,"" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of ""The Washington Free Beacon.""

Are we going to war, Susan, with Iran?

SUSAN PAGE, ""USA TODAY"": Well, judging from your interview with Secretary of State Pompeo, I'd say probably not. He -- you asked them if it's an active war, does that demand a military response, and he repeatedly denied -- declined to say yes. And judging from what the president did in June, after the American drone was shot down and he backed away from a military strike, I think the odds are against us taking military action in this case.

ROBERTS: The fact that he backed away from that strike, does that mean that he cannot take military action?

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, ""WASHINGTON FREE BEACON"": No. I mean he could take military action at any time. He's the commander-in-chief. What we're seeing, though, is that the maximum pressure campaign of the Trump administration has met maximum resistance from the Iranian regime. And the cyber operations and the economic warfare that the Trump White House has been waging against Iran has yet to deter them from their malign behavior in the region. But, that status quo is something I think the president prefers to all-out war.

ROBERTS: Right. It -- the -- Congress is saying he's got to come to Congress for an authorization to use military force against Iran. First of all, does he have to? And if he went to Congress, would he get it?

JONAH GOLDBERG, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": It depends. I think we would need more provocation than what we have seen. I'm sort of a purist on this kind of stuff. I do think that you should go to Congress, unless it's in response to an immediate and urgent national security thing, then it -- Congress has the -- has the sole authority to authorize war. But we've seen that eroded so much over the last 50 years, like so many other congressional prerogatives that I think it's anybody's guess.

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think, John, based on your question, you can tell there's no clear end game in sight. What we know is the president says he doesn't want war there, but he's previously also said we're locked and loaded. And what was incredible to me was to hear him say that he's waiting for guidance to come from the Saudis.

Now, the Iranians are no friends of ours, but, gosh, the Saudis, I don't know if they're a reliable and trustworthy regime. They kill American journalists. 9/11 is not to be forgotten.

ROBERTS: And here's another argument that people made. The United States has sold Saudi Arabia, and the president made a big deal of this, billions of dollars in military equipment. Can't the Saudis handle this themselves?

PAGE: And -- well, I guess we're going to find out. I mean we're making this gesture to Saudi Arabia with a very limited deployment. But -- but, yes, Saudi Arabia has a lot of defensive abilities, a lot of it provided by the United States, helped by the United States.

WILLIAMS: But I think the key point here is, Iran has denied responsibility, but we have no reason to trust that they are not responsible, or at least supporting the Houthi rebels that did this.

But the point from the American political perspective is, we are still trying to get out of Afghanistan. There is no appetite in his country for starting another war without a clear end game in sight. And the president has not provided that.

CONTINETTI: And the president's policy, it reflects exactly that attitude though.

WILLIAMS: Right. We all know what we're doing (ph).

PAGE: And the president's base doesn't back it either (ph).

CONTINETTI: He doesn't want to get involved either.

What's remarkable here, for 70 years plus, the United States has guaranteed the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. That is ending. At its ending because of fracking.

ROBERTS: Let's get on to the whistle-blower issue here.

President Trump, he was leaving for Houston a short time ago. He said this about his conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of the Ukraine, back on July 25th.

Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely perfect. And people better find out who these people are that are trying to subvert our country, because here we go again. These are bad people.

But the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely a ten.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERTS: So it was a ten. Is there anything wrong with the president saying to the president of the Ukraine, look, why don't you work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate what ties Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have to Ukrainian natural gas companies.

PAGE: Yes. It's soliciting foreign help in your campaign for re-election for president of the United States. And it's something that I think people would generally find alarming.

ROBERTS: Now, the Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton, so --

GOLDBERG: Yes, OK, look, I mean we've got to separate a whole bunch of things here. The idea -- you know, people who are -- you know, President Trump has -- has some weird messaging on this. On the one hand he says it's all made up and fake news. On the other hand he says he was spied on, which would suggest that, in fact, the allegations are true.

Rudy Giuliani comes on air today and take great umbrage at the accusation or insinuation that he's a political hit man, and then he spends the next seven minutes like the -- one of the biggest political hit men I've ever seen. It could be -- I don't -- I think there's a lot of smoke and -- and bluster going on in what Giuliani is doing. It could all be true.

If the president of the United States tried to bend national security, based upon his own partisan self-interest, that would be very, very, very bad. And the people who say he's just interested in corruption, this seems to be the only corruption case in the world he's concerned about, is the one about the guy who's beating him by ten points in the polls.

ROBERTS: ""The Washington Examiner"" had an article this morning that suggested that the whistle-blower does not have firsthand knowledge of any of this. But the point is, is that if you're going to investigate the president, and there are 9,573 investigations of the president going on right now, should you not also investigate the person who might become president?

CONTINETTI: A lot of conversations in Washington over the last 48 hours have begun with the word ""if."" And the fact is, we don't know. And so I think the advocates of impeachment in this case carry a heavy burden, John. One is that with the Russian investigation, there was a whole lot of misreporting and factual inaccuracy in the actual reporting. Two, when the Mueller report came out, it did not provide the data that Democrats wanted to impeach. And, third, all of these charges, as illustrated in Rudy Giuliani's interview with you, have the potential to boomerang on the Democratic Party.

ROBERTS: All right, so let me ask you about the Democratic Party, Juan. You heard Ben Cardin say he doesn't want to prejudge anything. He wants the information. He wants to see this.

You've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You've got Elizabeth Warren. You've got a myriad of other Democrats not even waiting for a shred of evidence here. They're looking at reporting and saying, impeach him, off with his head. I mean should they not wait -- do they not have a responsibility to wait until we know some facts here before we got down the impeachment road?

WILLIAMS: Yes, I think everyone should wait. But, remember, there's no reason to wait on the transcript. If, as the president describes it, nothing untoward took place, why is it that the administration is making such an effort to obstruct the Congress from getting that transcript?

What we know is --

ROBERTS: It's not the transcript that they're not holding back --

WILLIAMS: Well --

ROBERTS: It's the complaint.

WILLIAMS: Well, the complaint, the transcript, the whole thing. If -- because the transcript goes beyond the complaint, which is why I said transcript. But the idea is that this administration has, through the Justice Department, stop what is the law. The law says that if you have an urgent complaint, the inspector general of the director of national intelligence would transfer that to the Congress. It's not going on. That is wrong.

GOLDBERG: Previous presidents have also disputed the idea that the president has an obligation by the -- by statute to do that. It's a -- it's a murky constitutional issue.

PAGE: The one Democrat we haven't heard from calling for impeachment is the one Democrat who counts, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She set a standard that we need to hear Republicans be outraged by the president's behavior, not just Democrats. And so far we haven't heard that.

ROBERTS: Fifteen seconds.

CONTINETTI: We'll be waiting for a long time.

ROBERTS: Yes, Fifteen seconds, should the transcript be released?

WILLIAMS: Of course.

CONTINETTI: I think if it exculpates Trump, they should release it.

But there is the issue of executive privilege here, governing foreign communications, which also needs to be respected.

WILLIAMS: If this was Obama, House Republicans would have --

ROBERTS: We've got to go.

Thanks, Juan.

See you next Sunday, by the way.

Coming up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Denzel Washington and the club he says made him the man he is today.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROBERTS: For many children, the hours between three and 8:00 p.m. are when their futures are decided. As Chris Wallace reported last fall, one organization has opened its doors for over 100 years to make sure that kids have a place to go after school and stay out of trouble. One of those kids became a household name, and he is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DENZEL WASHINGTON, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN: It's where I learned so many life lessons, just thinking I was having fun.

CHRIS WALLACE, HOST (voice over): Denzel Washington is talking with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Four thousand local clubs that provide after-school programs for more than 4 million young people. And, in the process, change lives.

He was in Washington last fall for the group's annual dinner.

WASHINGTON: I remember that first day and how I felt and how special they made me feel.

WALLACE: And to honor the national youth of the year.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malachi Haynes.

WALLACE: Malachi Haynes of Colorado, who's been going to his club since he was six.

MALACHI HAYNES, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 2018 YOUTH OF THE YEAR: Being a leader and a role model in my community is my purpose.

WASHINGTON: I was a wild one. You know, I was -- I had a lot of energy.

WALLACE: Washington used to run track for his club. And he remembers when a new kid came in and started running faster. One of his mentors took him aside.

WASHINGTON: He said, he has natural ability, but his natural ability will only take him so far. So I applied that to -- to -- to my career, my first two years when I started acting in college.

WALLACE: Washington won the first of his two Oscars for his role in ""Glory,"" about an African-American military unit in the Civil War.

For more than 30 years, he's played a series of indelible characters.

WASHINGTON: To protect the sheep, you've got to catch the wolf. And it takes a wolf to catch a wolf, you understand?

I was never interested in being a movie star. We were sort of New York theater snobs. I wanted to be James Earl Jones, you know? I was hoping to make $650 on Broadway one day. And -- and I did.

WALLACE (on camera): Your father was a preacher and I've read that at various points in your life you've thought about becoming a preacher.

WASHINGTON: Uh-huh.

WALLACE: Really?

WASHINGTON: It was prophesies that I would preach. And -- by this woman. And I said, well, maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. And says, well, you already have a pulpit.

WALLACE (voice over): Now, Washington is more about giving back.

WASHINGTON: You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. That's what my pastor told me. You know, you -- whatever you have, you can't take it with you. So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have while you're here?

WALLACE (voice over): The Boys & Girls Clubs deal with the ups and downs of life too. Kids at the clubs do better at school, are less likely to do drugs, and volunteer more. Malachi started his own program to improve reading levels.

HAYNES: We call it Double Trouble. So we do an hour of reading, then an hour of playing basketball, eating pizza, just hanging out and getting to know the kids.

WALLACE: And Denzel Washington says that's the real message here.

WASHINGTON: We're just bombarded so much with negative news that the -- one can just feel like, well, what's the -- what's the use? But listening to these young people saying, oh, no, no, we're going to change it, we're going to do something about it, I'm -- that's inspiring.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERTS: Chris asked Washington where he sees himself at this stage of his career. He says he uses stuntmen more than he used to but is excited about the unknown and what comes next in his life and career.

And that's it for today. Chris is back again next weekend. We will see you next “Fox News Sunday.” Thanks for joining us.

The source said that it is made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials are on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower is not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way.

Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden family’s dealings, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

The new details, though, have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times had to amend an explosive story on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode.

On Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime,” GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said.

CNN first reported on questions about the whistleblower's direct knowledge of communications with Ukraine's leader.

In spite of those questions, the complaint has resulted in a showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire refused to share details of it with lawmakers. Democrats are pressing for the release of documents related to the complaint. Biden on Monday tweeted, ""release the transcript of the call.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“I write to urge that you and the Senate Republican majority take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the administration’s handling of security assistance to Ukraine,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment inspired by other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

But in a letter last week, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision.""

The inspector general for the intelligence community has clashed with the ODNI on the matter, however, and has advocated for the complaint's release to Congress.

Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to return focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed Biden’s son, Hunter, improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner.

Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump amounted to a major ""national scandal,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching.

Pelosi, who has long resisted calls to impeach Trump because the move would imperil the electability of moderate Democrats in the House, outlined her new stance in a statement Sunday. Pelosi specifically said that a whistleblower who reportedly alleged that Trump acted improperly during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided.

Her aggressive push came as top Republicans, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, predicted that the gambit would backfire for Democrats. Later in the evening, Trump sounded a similar note, saying the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.""

The whistleblower drama escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that a Ukrainian prosecutor had been investigating as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly bragged about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

CNN later reported the whistleblower had no direct knowledge of the call, and a top Ukrainian official on Saturday defended Trump's actions. Unverified reports circulated on left-leaning media outlets claiming that Trump could have promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved.

But if Democrats' demands were not met, Pelosi said, the Trump administration's ""grave new chapter of lawlessness"" would necessitate drastic action.

""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest,"" Pelosi said.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have hard evidence that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia.

“Why doesn’t the president just say, ‘Release the whistleblower complaint.’ Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,” Schiff said. “This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.”

“We may have crossed the Rubicon here,” he added, referring to the river that Julius Caesar fatefully traversed in 49 BC. “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment. ... but that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.”

The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery tweet: ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.""

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.""

The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

GIULIANI CLARIFIES CONFUSING CNN COMMENTS ON UKRAINE

Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, has long said publicly he wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine, and admitted this week that he's asked Ukraine to do so in the past -- but denied any impropriety or illegal conduct again on Sunday.

""This violation is about our national security,"" Pelosi said. ""The Inspector General determined that the matter is 'urgent' and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately.""

Inspector General Michael Atkinson of the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wrote in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But, the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an ""urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

HOUSE INTEL RANKING REPUBLICAN: THIS IS THE END OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN

""Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,"" Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday.

In her statement, Pelosi said Democrats would be watching closely.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. ""Thank you for your patriotism.""

Even some Republicans cautioned that the situation could be serious. Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a onetime Trump presidential rival, tweeted that ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival,"" that ""would be troubling in the extreme.""

At the same time, California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Biden's campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of the newly resurfaced reports about his possible misconduct in Ukraine that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race.""

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren surging ahead of Biden as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June.

Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

WATCH: POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP AMID WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATION

Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats, and that they'd been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department.

A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump told Fox News that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed the DOJ would review them.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better."" — Former Trump campaign adviser Barry Bennett

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who claimed Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power.""

WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE

""Trump’s doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum, and he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden told reporters in Iowa.

Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken ""just once"" about it.

""And now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,"" Trump said. ""Of course you spoke to your son!""

Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine, and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.""

Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted.

Bill Weld, who is challenging President Trump in the Republican primaries, proclaimed Monday that the president committed treason through his controversial phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- adding that the punishment for treason is death.

The statement drew a swift rebuke from the Trump campaign.

“The media’s affliction with Trump Derangement Syndrome has driven them into an actual discussion of the proposed execution of the President of the United States,” communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. “In severe cases of TDS such as this, immediate consultation with a physician is recommended.”

LONG-SHOT GOP PRIMARY CHALLENGERS TO HAVE THEIR OWN DEBATE THIS MONTH -- MINUS TRUMP

Weld was responding to claims that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden -- the son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden -- and threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine as leverage. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

“Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn’t be clearer. And that’s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason,"" Weld said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""It’s treason pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That’s the only penalty.”

Weld then referred to impeachment as a possible alternative to a criminal case, stating, “The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.”

Weld’s mention of the death penalty later ignited a conversation about the “legal framework” of the claim. Weld again said, “The only penalty for treason is death, it’s spelled out in the statute.”

While the U.S. Code does list the death penalty as a punishment for treason, Weld’s claim that it is the only penalty is false. Treason is covered by 18. U.S. Code § 2381, which says that a person guilty of treason “shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”

When Fox News asked Weld’s campaign about this, they did not immediately respond.

Weld's comments came during a joint television appearance with the two other longshot Republicans challenging Trump in next year's primary: former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep.

In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies.

Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American.

It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month.

Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government.

However, if these reports are true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner.

Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive.

In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems.

In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States.

However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will have little real effect.

It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed.

It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and that no one can or will stop him … again.

If that is true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion.

He should be held accountable. Every member of Congress and every American should stand up to Trump and for the rule of law.

That is the American way.

""When foreign leaders come together to speak, they need to be able to speak candidly,"" Grisham said during an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday. ""I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent,"" she noted.

Trump has been accused of pressuring Zelenskly to investigate 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter for their connection to a natural gas firm that is linked to a corruption investigation. Democratic lawmakers and some in the media have since called on Trump to release the full transcript of the conversation.

""[President Trump] is willing to do it, I think. But there's a lot of other people, lawyers and ... such that may have a problem with it. So we'll see what happens.""

Grisham said Democrats are choosing to attack Trump out of desperation and are grasping at straws to distract from their failure to resonate with voters.

""This is just another reason for Democrats and for the media to attack and look for things that just aren't there,"" she said earlier in the interview. ""The fact of the matter is, the president has calls with foreign leaders all the time. People are listening [in] on those calls generally. There's some kind of a transcription made generally.

Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate dealings involving 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats have been moving full steam ahead, calling for the whistleblower complaint to be released to lawmakers.

SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE ‘FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE’ OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT

“The Senate Republican ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. “This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.”

The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.

In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week.

“It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,” McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an “appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner.”

In a statement Monday, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley called for lawmakers not to rush to judgment.

“One thing we do know is that rampant speculation by politicians and the media is not helpful,” he said. “That’s how the false Russia collusion narrative took root.”

He added: “Let’s not repeat the mistakes of the past. Going forward, it’s important to respect the law and the whistleblower’s confidentiality while we gather the facts of the case. And of course, transparency is always the best policy so long as we don’t endanger national security.”

On Wednesday, Democrats chairing three House committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking the department to produce documents related to the complaint, or face subpoenas.

“Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,” the chairmen wrote. “Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.”

The letter was sent by Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland.

At least one Republican lawmaker, however, has called for the release of the transcript.

“At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic.

Meanwhile, a source told Fox News on Monday that the whistleblower who sparked the complaint did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation. The source said that it was made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky.

Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation or learned of it another way.

These new details have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times amended an explosive article on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode.

On Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime,” GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah on Monday likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said.

Republicans also have been trying to return the focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed son Hunter improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner.

Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Burisma hired Hunter Biden in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted amid protests and as his father was involved heavily in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Many critics in Ukraine and the West had accused Shokin of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But, the controversy flew largely under the radar until last week. While the heat has been on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Bernstein has been a staunch critic of President Trump and appeared on CNN’s liberal “Reliable Sources” on Sunday to offer his opinion on reports that a whistleblower may have accused the president of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and possibly using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests – but that didn’t stop Bernstein from comparing it to Watergate.

“If the reporting of Shane Harris and the Wall Street Journal is accurate, and it seems to be, it clearly moved toward a grievous abuse of power by the President of the United States. I keep getting asked, ‘Are there echoes of Watergate in this?’ There are in the following ways,” Bernstein said Sunday. “Watergate was very much an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the Democratic electoral process.”

Bernstein said that Nixon used “political espionage and sabotage” to nominate George McGovern, who Nixon considered the “weakest candidate,” as opposed to Edmund Muskie.

BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON

Back in 1972, Bernstein and Bob Woodward reported that a White House aide fabricated a letter detailing Muskie condoning a racial slur against Americans of French-Canadian descent, which derailed his campaign.

“Something of the same thing seems to be happening here where Biden, who Trump and his people have said they fear the most, in terms of being an opponent, has been the object of these, perhaps, dirty tricks,” Bernstein continued. ""One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a grievous offense if this is what happened.”

Bernstein, along with Woodward, helped take down President Nixon with Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal in the Washington Post.

Trump is facing renewed calls for his impeachment from some Democrats over a phone call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July.

Further reporting claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden's son and his business dealings.

Biggs said he's skeptical of the accusations against Trump since Schiff is leading the charge.

""Look who's promoting this. This is Adam Schiff really pushing this. His credibility, veracity should be challenged,"" he said, noting that Ukraine's foreign minister denied pressure was exerted by Trump. ""The fact that he leaks stuff as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that's a problem, too.""

During a bilateral meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the United Nations on Monday, Trump took several questions about the whistleblower controversy involving his communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His phone call with the Ukraine leader is alleged to have involved a potential investigation into Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden.

When specifically asked if he approved lawyer Rudy Giuliani's handling of the controversy in various interviews, the president singled out a clash the former New York City mayor had with Cuomo on CNN last week.

""I think he was excellent,"" Trump responded. ""I watched it the other night... I haven't watched that show in a long time. I don't watch CNN because it's fake news, but I watched Rudy take apart Fredo.""

Trump's ""Fredo"" insult was in reference to an August confrontation that went down between Cuomo and a heckler, who taunted the CNN anchor with a nickname drawn from ""The Godfather"" movies. Fredo referred to the weak-minded and suggestible brother of Michael Corleone.

""The press doesn't give [Giuliani] credit because they take little tiny snippets where Rudy was a little bit -- if he mispronounces a word, they'll show that and they won't show the whole,"" Trump continued. ""Rudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners. The first time I've watched CNN in a very long time. So I hate to watch it because it's so fake.""

Last month, a video posted online showed a man telling Cuomo, in regard to the Fredo tag, ""I thought that was who you were.""

""No, punk-ass b----es from the right call me 'Fredo.' My name is Chris Cuomo. I'm an anchor on CNN,"" a heated Cuomo responded. ""'Fredo' was from 'The Godfather.'

“It’s just a repeat, it’s a rerun, it’s a sequel to what they did with Russia,” Sununu told “America’s Newsroom.”

Trump was accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. This prompted Democratic lawmakers to call for the release of the entire transcript of the phone call in question.

“[Democratic California House Rep. Adam] Schiff goes out, makes an outrageous statement, as he did with the Russia claims, and the Mueller report just made it clear that all those claims that came out of Schiff were pure unadulterated lies,” said Sununu, who served as White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush.

Sununu said that the Trump administration should release the entire transcript as he is aware that it would draw concern.

“If I were the White House, I would try and release as much as the transcript of the conversation as possible,” he said.

He said that if the transcript were to be disclosed, foreign leaders will not speak frankly with the president in fear that the intelligence community in the U.S. can't keep secrets.

Sununu went on to say, “This has got a long way to go. A lot of information will come out. The Dems will do what they did. The press will do what they did. You’re probably going to get Carl Bernstein, claiming it’s another Watergate and so on.""

Speaking on CNN, Bernstein did, in fact, compare the Ukraine scandal to Watergate.

Nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters questioned in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll say they support a government-run single-payer Medicare-for-all style system that would replace existing private insurance. That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL

But among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance.

The poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing a Medicare buy-in for those under 65 years old. That’s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older.

The latest Fox News national poll also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.

Among all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers.

Health care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he may seek to withhold funds from the intelligence community unless they disclose the full contents of the conversation.

Schiff, who serves as the House Intel Committee chairman, appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, where host Jake Tapper asked if Schiff would be willing to put the nation at risk to get to the bottom of the cryptic report.

""It depends on what funds we withhold,"" Schiff replied. ""In this case, you have the office of the director of national intelligence that is withholding this complaint in violation of the clear letter of the law... And there are funding requests that that office makes that don’t go directly to national security that we can withhold.""

The story was first reported by the Washington Post as a whistleblower claim about Trump making some type of ""promise"" to a foreign leader, which may have been of a nefarious nature. Further reporting claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden's son and his business dealings.

GREGG JARRETT: THE TRUMP WHISTLEBLOWER MAY NOT BE A WHISTLEBLOWER AT ALL

""Look, it is a blunt remedy and one that I’m very reluctant to use,"" Schiff continued. ""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious...but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer.""

Schiff also reignited the impeachment debate which seemed to be fading away, after several failed attempts by House lawmakers to oust the president from office.

""If there is a fire burning, it needs to be put out. And that's why we’re going to have to look at every remedy. And if these two issues are, in fact, one issue and it relates to deplorable conduct, a violation of the president’s oath of office... then we're going to have to consider impeachment as well,"" he said.

Trump responded to the story on Twitter Thursday and again on Saturday, saying the narrative was ""fake news"" conjured up by biased members of the media.

Trump also responded to the story while speaking to reporters outside the White House Sunday morning, and claimed he did nothing wrong.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has apparently reached a boiling point over moderate House Democrats’ caution regarding the prospect of impeaching President Trump.

The go-slow approach is personified by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with whom Ocasio-Cortez has had an often contentious relationship since the freshman lawmaker arrived in Washington just eight months ago.

The New York Democrat told her more than 5 million Twitter followers late Saturday that the Democrats’ “refusal” to seek the removal of the president was a “bigger national scandal” than what she alleged was the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.”

JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

Calls for impeachment have grown louder from some Democrats in the wake of last week’s news that a purported “whistleblower” had expressed concern about a phone call said to have taken place between President Trump and the leader of Ukraine, in which Trump allegedly sought information about 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, whose son Hunter Biden had business dealings in Ukraine.

Soon after Ocasio-Cortez posted her Saturday comment, she received a response from James Fallows, the noted author, journalist and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, who asserted that Ocasio-Cortez was overstating the case in criticizing members of her own party for exercising restraint regarding impeachment.

LEADING HOUSE DEM TELLS PARTY NOT TO BE 'HASTY' IN PURSUING WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS

“IMO, this is ‘false equivalence’ of its own sort,” Fallows wrote. “What Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem.

“Second-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate.

“Then: it’s time for the House to act.”

Ocasio Cortez doubled down in her response to Fallows.

“It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law,” she wrote. “It’s another to let him.

“The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It’s threatened when we do nothing about it.

“The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s online outburst followed remarks earlier in the day by fellow progressive and 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who took a veiled shot at Pelosi, the standard-bearer among Democrats of a “wait and see” approach regarding potential action against the president.

""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice,” Warren said at an event in Iowa. “I read all 448 pages [of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation] and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump.

“Congress failed to act,” Warren added, “and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system.”

Just over a week ago, Pelosi had lashed out at reporters when they repeatedly asked her about impeachment at a news conference.

“Impeachment is a very divisive measure,” a clearly frustrated Pelosi said, “but if we have to go there, we have to go there and we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we’ll follow the facts and follow the obstruction the president is making ... and make a decision when we’re ready.

“That’s the only question, that’s all I’m going to say about this subject, and there's nothing different from one day to the next,” she added.

The struggles experienced by the 79-year-old Pelosi, a three-decade member of Congress from California, have included frequent clashes with Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and other progressive – and aggressive – young lawmakers who were swept into office during last year’s midterm elections. The progressives’ push for far-left policies, including Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, as well as their vocal opposition to President Trump, have been at odds with the moderates’ typically lower-key approach to getting things done.

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. The meeting was soon followed by the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

But with Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter posts that began late Saturday, it appears the truce with Pelosi – at least regarding impeachment – may be over.

The allegation is that the former vice president urged Ukraine to fire an inept prosecutor because the official was investigating a company tied to Biden’s son. We already know that’s not what happened.

The company in question wasn’t the actual target of the Ukrainian probe, and the former vice president’s efforts received international praise because he helped replace an ineffective prosecutor with a better one – something Biden wouldn’t have done if he were trying to shield corruption from scrutiny.

For that matter, the better prosecutor agreed that the Bidens didn’t do anything wrong.

But Republicans are giving this a try anyway, though as this exchange between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and CNN’s Jake Tapper helped demonstrate yesterday, Team Trump may want to consider some new talking points.

MNUCHIN: What I do find inappropriate is the fact that Vice President Biden at the time’s son did very significant business dealings in Ukraine. I, for one, find that to be concerning. And, to me, that is the issue perhaps that should be further investigated. TAPPER: I don’t understand. So it is OK for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Jr. to do business all over the world, it’s OK for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president, but while Vice President Joe Biden was vice president, his son shouldn’t have been able to do business dealings? MNUCHIN: Again, I don’t really want to go into more of these details…

Well, no, I suppose not. If I were in Mnuchin’s shoes, and I knew Donald Trump was watching, I probably wouldn’t want to “go into more of these details,” either.

The Treasury secretary’s clumsiness notwithstanding, it’s going to be difficult for the White House and its allies to work around this one.

Yesterday, the president himself complicated matters just a bit more.

During a brief Q&A with reporters at the White House yesterday, Trump made it seem as if it were a foregone conclusion that Biden spoke to his son about his dealings in Ukraine. “I mean, give me a break,” the Republican said, adding, “Who wouldn’t speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son.”

Oh? Is that so? Because I seem to recall an incident from 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr. participated in a meeting with Russian emissaries in order to acquire foreign intelligence to help win an American election. Donald Trump Sr. said he never spoke to his son about the meeting.

“I mean, give me a break,” one might be tempted to tell the president. “Who wouldn’t speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son.”"

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

Guy Benson: HAPPY HOUR TIME ON THE GUY BENSON show it's a new week. Thank you for listening. Guy Benson show dot.com I'm in D.C. all week. Feels weird to be home for an entire week in a row. That's Not a thing. Delighted to be in the Tony Snow radio studios again. The Web site Guy Benson show dot.com the podcast. First hour is free every day also available on iTunes. Back on the show one of our favorite guests he's a Republican congressman from the great state of Illinois. Adam Kinzinger is here. Congressman great to have you back.

Rep. Kinzinger: What's up brother. Good to be with you.

Guy Benson: Good to have you here. Let's dive in on foreign policy and then we might go farther afield from there. And there were a number of developments last week involving Iran. I know you've been following this extremely closely and there was what appears to be and what the secretary of state has called an act of war by the regime against Saudi targets. This is on the heels of all the other provocations attacking ships international waters taking down one of our drones funding and fomenting terrorism as they've done for many many years. And I guess I saw the president deployed some troops to Saudi Arabia. There has been no specific military response and I'm just getting frustrated because I'm. On one hand yes skeptical of escalating a possible war with Iran but on the other hand I'm worried about the consequences of letting them on there end to escalate and escalate with impunity. Over and over again with no real consequences outside of sanctions it seems like we're sort of sanctioned out at this point and we've hit our max according to Treasury Secretary on that front. Is there a policy here that you think could bridge that divide and that would be proportional and appropriate.

Rep. Kinzinger : Yeah I agree with you and it's also to an extent it's going to be honest. This red line in Syria of President Obama where you know it's one thing to talk tough as President Obama did as you know as President Trump is for him to not react is it just sends the wrong message.

Rep. Kinzinger: I mean where the United States of America is very patient but we're very capable. You know first thing I want to say is to all the people that are saying we should let Saudi Arabia respond to Iran. I want to be clear about something. That's the best option. If your goal is to get into a wider conflict because the Saudis attacking Iran will immediately turn this to immediately a regional war between Sunni and Shia Arabs. That's how that works when the United States does it. It doesn't have that effect.

Rep. Kinzinger: And I think there's three options here. And I think there has to be a military response because it's going to keep going. The fact is is just look at history.

Rep. Kinzinger: At no point is Iran going to say OK we've done enough. Keep escalating. And it's like a bull you've got to punch him eventually. We have to stop doing that so the three of us.

Guy Benson: So what we what does that look like though a military response. What does a punch back look like. That is not you know an invasion.

Rep. Kinzinger: Yeah I think it's a number of things. So it can be taken out you know certain ships that have been used as radar by Iran. It could be taken out the sites that actually launched this missile attack in Saudi Arabia.

Rep. Kinzinger: It could be taking out an Iranian oilfield all of which will be proportional. But the other thing and I think actually maybe a better option is actually going after arriving in assets in Syria. So if you know every month or so you hear about the Israelis arming IRGC Revolutionary Guard Corps assets in Syria of which there is many I think that's an option too because just like you know Saudi Arabia may not have been our territory. Syria may not be their territory and more fair game but I think we can do this in a way where we're clear that it's proportional in any decision to escalate isn't ours it's theirs at some point though you know everybody likes to blame America first and say we will start escalating. This has been escalating and we've done nothing. So it's not US right now.

Guy Benson: No that's it. And so that's the flip side of this thing and I was mentioning this on the news channel last week it seems like a talking point that has gelled especially on the left but certain elements on the right as well that oh well this is really traced back to President Trump's correct in my view decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal which as an aside was opposed by 60 percent of Congress. No big deal. This was a you know a unilateral presidential decision that Obama made and Trump got us out of it and people are saying well you know Iran wouldn't be doing all this stuff if not for that so we should look in the mirror and I just think that's sort of crazy revisionism.

Rep. Kinzinger: Yeah. I mean look it's always it's the blame America first crowd. And you know that we have the ability if we were just nice people this world would actually all get along. But all you have to do is look before the Iran nuclear deal was even being discussed it what Iran has done. Look at their behavior in the region after the nuclear deal that's when they overthrew the legitimate government of Yemen and emboldened Hutu rebels that's when they proved cartel blanch into Syria and killed a lot of people. That's when the Hezbollah got better arms and on. And if you look before that you know a quarter of American lives that were lost in Iraq were directly or indirectly from Iran.

Rep. Kinzinger: I actually recently declassified what the task force did.

Rep. Kinzinger: But part of my operations in Iraq were actually against Iranians. And then you go back all the way to 1979. So unless President Trump was president in 1979. All right that's an invalid argument.

Guy Benson: Indeed. Meanwhile President Trump on a somewhat related issue.

Guy Benson: Gave what I found to be a rather puzzling answer during a press conference last week on Friday he was talking about ISIS fighters who had been captured. He said we've defeated the caliphate. We have thousands of ISIS fighters. We need help from the Europeans to imprison and detain these people because we can't keep them all in the U.S. or at Guantanamo Bay. For decades it will cost a huge amount of money. And you know so far so good I don't have a problem with those points that he's making it and he said. And they haven't been very helpful in Europe so at some point we might just have to release these ISIS fighters right on the border. And I was like Okay I don't know what that is. But that sounds nuts to me. What. Yeah. What. But okay. So I assume you oppose the idea of just releasing thousands of ISIS and I don't think Trump does as well but he does have a point about OK we went in there a bunch of these guys did get scooped up. They are hardened Islamist militant terrorists. What do we do with them that is some of these guys many of them are in their 20s. Do we just keep them on taxpayer dime for the rest of their natural lives. I mean that also doesn't seem sustainable what do we do here.

Rep. Kinzinger: Yeah that's right.

Rep. Kinzinger: And you know I think part of it is we've we struggled with this since the beginning of the war on terror which is what do we do with people that don't fall under the Geneva Convention which terrorists do not because they don't fight for a country and they don't fight uniform and there's any number of reasons we still treat them according to the Geneva Convention and in some cases better.

Rep. Kinzinger: But that's what it puts into the question in terms of the you know how do you treat them on a justice side. I think we're ultimately going to have to do military tribunals. I think ultimately in areas where we can send these people back where a country will take them and try them in their courts with their justice system that's another opportunity especially Iraq for instance I mean they they have some pretty pretty good justice I think for these guys if that came down to it.

Rep. Kinzinger: So I think we have to look for areas that way and those which is what's basically left in Gitmo right now are those that basically did not have a home and are among the worst and most hardened of criminals that you just can't release anywhere because nobody will take them.

Rep. Kinzinger: And in that case yeah I mean it's it's unfortunately going to be part of what we have to do which is you know either have a decision to release them or to house them forever or you know you put them in federal courts and what happens if they actually get us on a technicality or something. So it's all a big concern but the president needs to not say stuff like that because you know I mean I just put it through the what would what would I do if Obama said at present. And I would be very upset with it. So I'd be pretty upset.

Rep. Kinzinger: What about when President Trump says that as well.

Guy Benson: Let's stick with that prism for a moment and look at the Ukraine controversy. We don't know what was said how it was said it does seem like the president has confirmed that there was a discussion with the president of Ukraine where he was urging Ukraine to look into corruption including this allegation about the Bidens you know I guess his his lawyer his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was dispatched along these same lines. And it does seem like a lot of the people who said the Russia stuff was all a smoking gun and it was gonna be impeachment tomorrow. They've moved on to this thing. This also does strike me as concerning as well how do we keep this in perspective as a member of Congress who you know your colleagues on the other side of the aisle might start moving more towards the I word it seems like Pelosi is now open to that on this on this topic as someone who might have to take a vote on impeachment for example. How are you thinking about this story separate from the whole Russia saga.

Rep. Kinzinger: So the question is Is it high crimes and misdemeanors. That's number one. Number two is highly inappropriate. So number two it's absolutely highly inappropriate. What President Trump did and I don't care about the Biden arguments. I you know that's important and we need to get to the bottom of it. But at the same time I think the vice president Vice President Biden's comments were based on trying to get this guy fired because he wasn't going after you know the oligarch for instance that his son worked for and everything else that's separate. And if there's any impropriety propriety there we need to know. But never should a president of the United States ever use the natural power instruments to basically help himself in a political race. And so there's a lot we don't know and that's why I hope the transcript of the call is released. I don't think even if he did use the national power to do that, it doesn't rise to the level of impeachment. But it is highly inappropriate if it was done and we have to again put it through the what would we say if Obama did it filter. You know if Obama had had asked Ukraine to investigate when a Trump sons for instance. What would we be saying. We just need the president to hear from the people around him know sometimes and listen to it because look he's going to get himself in real trouble if he's not careful. So I hope this transcripts released so. I could see either way but in terms of just I don't see this rising the level of teachers but it absolutely needs to be called out as wrong and not defended.

Guy Benson: Last question it's on policy and it has an intersection with politics as well you are one of the Republican members in the House who at least signaled some openness to some modest additional steps on gun regulation or gun restrictions talking about background checks and that sort of thing we talked about it on this show a number of weeks ago and I know you got some blowback on the right.

Guy Benson: I don't know if you're gonna get any credit on the left but I think something that's a reality and I wonder how this has affected your thinking if at all when you have numerous Democrats running for president coming out and endorsing so-called mandatory buybacks which is confistation and they're talking about effectively national gun registries when they're looking at background checks. A lot of the slippery slope folks on the Second Amendment side say OK. Even if we are open to some of this stuff that Kinzinger is talking about here the Democrats telling us that our conspiracy theory is in fact very much true. They want background checks to create a registry and they want to confiscate guns. Does that make it much more difficult for you just on a suspicion level to go along with anything that might seem like a compromise because the other side is telegraphing very explicitly what they would like to do.

Rep. Kinzinger: Yeah. You know I think it's going to make it hard to get anything done. That's for sure. You know my view on it is I'm not. I believe the slippery slope conspiracy. I mean I do. And so when I came to the decision I mean I'm. I'm not calling for banning assault rifles that would be a pretty you know a big step. I'm not saying that but what I'm saying those areas where we can't make a difference. That's not violating the Constitution we should. And so even with the slippery slope argument my view and how I take a position on politics is regardless what the other side wants to do what's the right thing to do. And let's see what the right thing to do is. We have to guard against the slippery slope. And so you know my concern though is if nothing is done at all and this scourge continues that you're going to have people massively turn against the Second Amendment in the long run which is a big concern for me.

Rep. Kinzinger: And then secondly we do have to have the talk about the spiritual and mental health issue in this country. That's the real depth of this. And we have to have that conversation. Why is it that a whole generation of young men are so broken that they'll go to something like this. That that's not the whole generation that somewhat.

Guy Benson: Congressman Adam Kinzinger a Republican of Illinois always thoughtful always informed. Congressman thank you very much.

Rep. Kinzinger: You bet Good seeing you.

Guy Benson: We will roll along here all the happy hour it's the Guy Benson show. Stay with us."

Well, OK, let's do that.",2019-09-24,MSNBC,"As scandal brews, Trump brings 'the electric chair' into the debate",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scandal-brews-trump-brings-the-electric-chair-the-debate,"Yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump spoke to reporters in New York for about 10 minutes, sitting alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, and the Republican pushed back against his latest scandal by throwing a bit of a tantrum.

“If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now. “Look at the double standards. You people ought to be ashamed of yourself. And not all. We have some great journalists around. But you got a lot of crooked journalists. You’re crooked as hell. “Okay. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed it.”

To the extent that reality still has any meaning, Joe Biden didn’t do anything wrong. There’s no evidence whatsoever of any misdeeds. I don’t agree with every decision the former vice president ever made, and I don’t agree with every position he’s ever taken, but those looking for real controversies surrounding the Democratic candidate will need to look elsewhere.

The idea that Biden committed some kind of capital offense, deserving of execution, is as indefensible as it is ridiculous.

That said, if the president is eager to talk about “double standards,” let’s take a short stroll down that road.

National Review, a prominent conservative outlet, published an item late last week, that raised a straightforward observation: “There is not a Republican alive who would find it acceptable for a Democratic president to press a foreign country to work with his personal lawyer to investigate a domestic political rival.”

I can appreciate why so many on the right break out in a cold sweat every time someone like me says, “Imagine if Obama did this…” but under the circumstances, with Trump urging the public to consider the scandal from the other direction, specifically calling on us to “look at the double standards,” let’s go ahead and take the president’s advice.

Imagine it’s 2011. Barack Obama’s approval ratings are in the low-to-mid 40s; Nate Silver considers him an underdog in his re-election bid; and the Democratic White House sees Mitt Romney as a credible electoral threat.

Then imagine Obama personally puts a hold on foreign aid to a foreign country, has a meeting with that country’s president, and with very little subtlety, tells his counterpart how eager he is to see an investigation into one of Romney’s sons. In fact, in this hypothetical, Obama has also dispatched his lawyer to help lobby the foreign government, all in the hopes of acquiring dirt on the Democrat’s domestic rival.

How do you suppose Republicans – including guys like Donald Trump – might respond to a story like that?"

John Lewis (D-Ga.) – a man who’s been described as “the conscience of Congress” – adding his voice to the chorus.

“There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation,” the Georgia Democrat said on the House floor today. “I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come.”

As of this minute, I believe there are now 152 House Democrats and one House independent on board with the idea, though these numbers are subject to change at any moment. For those keeping score, there are currently 235 House Dems, which means 65% of the conference – very nearly a two-thirds majority – supports, at a minimum, pursuing presidential impeachment.

Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the few top 2020 contenders who hasn’t endorsed impeachment, will reportedly announce today that if Trump refuses to comply with Congress’ investigations, lawmakers will have no choice but to draw articles. (The other most recent Democratic vice president, Al Gore, also suggested yesterday he supports an impeachment process.)

And in case this weren’t quite enough, Senate Democrats are starting to climb aboard the same train. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) endorsed Trump’s impeachment yesterday, and early this morning, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) issued a written statement along the same lines.

“It is now my belief that the House of Representatives must begin an impeachment inquiry into the president’s corrupt efforts to press a foreign nation into the service of his reelection campaign. As part of the inquiry, the House should take steps to assure that the pending whistleblower complaint be presented to Congress in full, and an investigation must take place into the full extent of the Trump administration’s demands that the Ukrainian government become agents of the president’s political agenda. If, as it appears Mr. Trump has already acknowledged, the president violated his oath of office by using the constitutional powers entrusted to him to try to destroy a political rival, then the president much be impeached. “I am deeply sorry that our nation must begin this journey toward impeachment. Up until these recent developments, I had resisted calling for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, choosing instead to allow the House to consider its options free from senatorial advice. But circumstances have changed, and the seriousness of the moment requires all of us to speak out in order to preserve our nation’s commitment to the rule of law.”

Soon after, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) echoed the call, as did Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).

As Politico reported, “The Illinois Democrat is the highest ranking member of Senate Democratic leadership to endorse impeachment proceedings. Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the No. 3 and No. 4 Senate Democrats, previously said they supported an impeachment inquiry.”

At a certain level, I can appreciate why the opinions of Senate Democrats may be of limited relevance. They are, after all, in the minority, and won’t have a say as to whether or not the House acts.

But I think it matters when so many Senate Dems endorse impeachment because it sends an unmistakable signal that a party consensus is taking shape.

I don’t doubt that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) remains skeptical of the process, just as I’m sure she believes it’s in her party’s interests to choose a different course. But as powerful as Pelosi is, Congress’ top Democrat will find it incredibly difficult to push back against the consensus view of her party.

For months, I considered Trump’s impeachment unlikely. Suddenly, it seems inevitable."

It noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced at a conference that the United States had released $250 million in military aid – with an additional $140 million on top of that sum.

The Trump administration said Thursday [Sept. 12] that it has released $250 million in military aid to Ukraine that had been held up. It didn’t mention additional funds. Zelenskiy’s deputy chief of staff Kirill Tymoshenko confirmed to The Associated Press after the president’s speech that Ukraine is indeed expecting an extra $140 million from the U.S., but he wouldn’t give detail on the source or designation of the funds.

There may very well be nothing to this, but it was a curious series of events. The Trump administration was supposed to give Ukraine $250 million, but that money was on hold when the American president spoke via phone to his Ukrainian counterpart – a conversation in which Trump reportedly pressed Zelenskiy eight times about investigating Biden.

Soon after learning that the military aid was on hold, the editorial board of the Washington Post published a piece alleging that the Republican was effectively trying to “extort” Ukraine, making the $250 million contingent on Kyiv agreeing to participate in Trump’s political scheme.

Soon after, in the face of bipartisan congressional pushback, the Trump administration agreed to release the aid to Ukraine – though according to the Associated Press, the package was worth $390 million, not $250 million. This, of course, came shortly before House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) exposed the existence of the whistleblower’s complaint to the intelligence community’s inspector general.

On Meet the Press yesterday, NBC News’ Chuck Todd asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin where the extra $140 million came from. From the transcript:

MNUCHIN: Well, it was appropriated money that came through the State Department. TODD: [Ukrainians] didn’t know they were getting this money. Is there any indication why they got the money when they did? MNUCHIN: I’m not sure it’s correct for you to say they didn’t know they got the money. – TODD: The president said he was surprised to get it. The president of Ukraine said he was surprised to get an additional $140 million. He said it was a pleasant surprise but that he was surprised. MNUCHIN: I think he was referring to his expectations, as opposed to necessarily a surprise. But you’re getting into details.

Well, yeah, I suppose so. But don’t the details matter?"

* In Nevada, a new Suffolk University/Reno Gazette Journal poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers shows Joe Biden leading, but his margin over Elizabeth Warren is shrinking. The former vice president has 24% support, followed by Warren at 19%, and Bernie Sanders at 14%. Every other Democratic presidential hopeful was below 5% in this poll.

* Speaking of Sanders, the Vermont senator unveiled a new wealth tax today, including a steep tax specifically targeting billionaires. The longtime independent added that he hopes “the day comes when” billionaires no longer exist.

* According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, a combined 69% of voters say they don’t like Donald Trump personally, “regardless of their feelings about his policy agenda.” Before Trump, the worst any modern president has fared on this question was George W. Bush in March 2006, right after Hurricane Katrina, when 42% of voters said they didn’t like the president personally, regardless of his policies.

* The Democratic National Committee announced new qualifying thresholds for the party’s November presidential primary debate: participants will need to reach 3% support in four polls and 165,000 unique donors. There is, however, a notable twist: the DNC also said that candidates can reach the polling threshold by reaching 5% support in two approved polls from the early nominating states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and/or South Carolina).

* With virtual caucuses ruled out as a result of cybersecurity concerns, Iowa Democrats are moving forward with a series of “satellite” caucuses that will be held on February 3, though not necessarily at the same time.

* A year after 67% of voters ages 18 to 22 voted Democratic, the Republican National Committee is launching a voter-registration campaign intended to mobilize Donald Trump’s on-campus supporters. According to the Associated Press, the effort is called the “Make Campus Great Again” initiative."

The former New York City mayor has already admitted pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in order to help his client in the Oval Office – something Giuliani considers entirely proper. Last night, he told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that State Department asked him to pursue such efforts.

HANNITY: You didn’t get involved in this on your own. Did our State Department ask you to go on a mission for them? GIULIANI: They did. I was called by the State – HANNITY: And you’re a good citizen and you went? GIULIANI: The State Department called me and said, would I take a call from Mr. Yermak, who’s number two or three to the president-elect, now the president. I was put together with Mr. Earmach. I talked to him he gave me enormously important facts. I conveyed them all to the State Department – unlike the media lies, fake news, I wasn’t operating on my own. I was operating at the request of the State Department.

This roughly dovetails with a Wall Street Journal report from the weekend, which said that Giuliani, according to his own account, met with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to the Ukrainian president, as part of a meeting that had been “set up by the State Department.”

As a rule, taking Giuliani’s rhetoric at face value makes about as much sense as taking Donald Trump’s rhetoric at face value. It’s entirely possible, if not likely, that the former mayor will walk all of this back, perhaps even claiming he didn’t say what a national audience heard him say.

But in case this isn’t obvious, if the U.S. State Department was directly involved in dispatching the president’s private lawyer to Ukraine, as part of a political scheme intended to help Trump’s re-election campaign, it will make the already damaging story quite a bit worse.

Speaking of Giuliani, the Republican lawyer told CNN last week, in reference to his efforts in Ukraine, “I did what I did on my own, and then I told [Trump] about it afterwards. Because I’m his lawyer.”

Over the weekend, however, the Washington Post asked Giuliani whether Trump had given the lawyer’s efforts his presidential blessing. Giuliani replied, “I don’t do anything that involves my client without speaking with my client.”

Those two answers don’t seem to line up perfectly.

Update: On Face the Nation over the weekend, CBS News’ Margaret Brennan asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not only whether he considered Giuliani’s efforts “appropriate,” but also, “Has the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine been providing support, the State Department been supporting what he’s doing?”

Pompeo replied that he’s “not going to talk about that.”"

Little did I know he’d soon after do it again.

President Donald Trump on Monday defended his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling it a “perfect” discussion, while suggesting he had tied vital military funding for Ukraine to that country’s handling of corruption – which he has alleged Vice President Joe Biden’s family was engaged in there. “We want to make sure that country is honest. It’s very important to talk about corruption. If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” Trump told reporters when asked what he had spoken about with Ukraine’s new president in a July phone call. “It’s very important that, on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption,” he said, moments after telling reporters: “let me just tell you – let me just tell you. What Biden did was wrong.”

Putting aside the fact there’s no evidence whatsoever of Biden having done anything wrong, and the fact that the president has an unfortunate record of making all kinds of false allegations against his perceived political foes, this was the first time the public has heard Trump make a connection between his call with the Ukrainian president, U.S. financial/military aid, and Trump’s electoral scheme.

The original Republican line was that nothing happened. The second line was that Trump may, in fact, have talked to a foreign government about intervening in an American election. And the brand new line is that Trump, while talking to a foreign government about intervening in an American election, referenced the $250 million the United States committed to Ukraine.

Or to put this in broader strokes, we’re witnessing the transition from “the accusation isn’t true” to “the accusation is true, but there’s nothing actually wrong with misdeed in question.”

Around the time the president was moving the ball forward, one of his personal attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, sat down with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo and said he couldn’t be entirely sure Trump didn’t threaten to cut off aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky went along with the Republican’s scheme.

BARTIROMO: Did the president threaten to cut off aid to the Ukraine? GIULIANI: No, no, that was a false story. BARTIROMO: One hundred percent? GIULIANI: Well, I can’t tell you if it’s 100 percent.

Why Team Trump allows Giuliani to appear on television is a bit of a mystery to me."

* The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll – the most closely watched of all Iowa polls – found Elizabeth Warren taking the lead in the first Democratic nominating contest with 22%, followed by Joe Biden at 20%. Bernie Sanders was third with 11%, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg at 9%. Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with 6% support. (Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

* Staff shake-ups on Bernie Sanders’ team continue, with the Vermont senator parting ways with one of his Iowa deputy field directors. Kevin Lata had previously worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 team.

* In keeping with the recent trend, the Alaska Republican Party became the latest state GOP to officially cancel its Republican presidential primary, which had been scheduled for April. Several state parties have taken similar steps to protect Donald Trump from possible embarrassment against his primary rivals.

* As the General Motors strike continues, several Democratic presidential candidates have visited picket lines to show support for members of the United Auto Workers.

* With some evidence of Texas becoming more competitive, Republican officials are making it easier for Green Party candidates to qualify for the ballot, with the obvious hope that the move will undermine Democratic support.

* Though it’s difficult to know if this is a stunt, Cory Booker’s campaign manager wrote in a new memo to staff and supporters that the New Jersey senator’s presidential campaign may come to an end without another $1.7 million before the end of the quarter. (The third quarter ends a week from today.)

* As expected, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D) officially kicked off a primary campaign in Massachusetts against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D) over the weekend.

It seems like ages ago, but it was just last month when the president announced an effort to have the next G-7 summit held at one of his Florida properties, creating a dynamic in which several key world leaders would have no choice but to effectively put money in his pocket by way of one of his struggling businesses.

Soon after, Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Ireland for meetings in Dublin, but at the president’s “suggestion,” he stayed three hours away at a Trump-owned property on the other side of the country. This, of course, was followed by reports about military personnel staying at Trump’s business in Scotland, while supporting a nearby airport on which the president’s business heavily relies.

And then, of course, the public learned about Trump’s alleged efforts to get Ukraine to help his re-election campaign by digging up dirt on one of his Democratic rivals – a story the president appears to have lied about, changed his story about, and taken steps to cover up.

It was against this backdrop that the Republican spoke to reporters yesterday, sitting alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda. Trump turned to a familiar tactic:

“[T]here was no pressure put on [Ukrainian officials] whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it would probably, possibly, have been okay if I did. But I didn’t. I didn’t put any pressure on them whatsoever. You know why? Because they want to do the right thing. And they know about corruption. And they probably know that Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. They probably know that. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right? But the fake news doesn’t want to report it because they’re Democrats.”

In reality, there’s simply no evidence of the former vice president engaging in any corruption. Republicans are playing a little game, and expecting everyone to play along, but they’re pushing an unsubstantiated claim.

But when push comes to shove, the president can’t shake what I like to think of as his “no-puppeting” problem. Confronting allegations of corruption, Trump reflexively accuses his critics of corruption. The Republican has a playbook for defending himself, and projection is the first page.

A couple of months ago, for example, Trump faced condemnations after using racist rhetoric against four Democratic congresswomen of color. The president responded by accusing the congresswomen of being racists.

A couple of months before that, following a series of bizarre incidents, Trump was accused of mental decline. He responded by accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of being in mental decline.

Circling back to our earlier coverage, it’s a tactic that’s come to define his entire approach to politics: like an intemperate child, Trump’s I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I instincts are finely tuned after extensive practice.

When Democrats accused the president a variety of crimes, Trump insisted the “real crimes were committed” by Democrats. When Dems argued the president obstructed justice, Trump replied that it’s the Dems who have obstructed justice.

Confronted with allegations that his political operation colluded with Russian attackers, Trump said Democrats colluded with Russia. Told that the Kremlin supported his candidacy, Trump responded by saying Russia supported Democrats. Accused of being a manipulated pawn for Vladimir Putin, Trump accused Barack Obama of being Putin’s “patsy.”

And during the 2016 campaign: whenever Hillary Clinton would criticize Trump, it was a near certainty that Trump would then make the identical accusation against Clinton. After a while, as regular readers may recall, this got a little creepy.

Clinton accused Trump of being unstable and reckless, so Trump said Clinton is “unstable” and “reckless.” Clinton said Trump mistreated women, so Trump said Clinton mistreated women. Clinton accused Trump of bigotry, so Trump said Clinton’s a “bigot.” Clinton questioned Trump’s temperament, so Trump said Clinton had a bad “temperament.” Clinton said Trump makes a poor role model for children, so Trump said Clinton sets “a terrible example for my son and the children in this country.”

And, of course, Clinton accused Trump of being a “puppet” for his allies in Moscow during a 2016 debate. Trump, showing all of the sophistication of a slow toddler, responded, “No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet. No, you’re the puppet.”

With a track record like this one, is it really any wonder Trump is falsely accusing Biden of corruption?"

In reality, of course, it matters very much what Trump discusses with foreign leaders. In fact, literally within minutes of the president making the comment, the Wall Street Journal published a report alleging that Trump “repeatedly pressured” Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son, urging the Ukrainian leader “about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump’s potential 2020 opponent.”

Yesterday, Trump turned to a familiar page in his playbook, effectively confirming that he did, in fact, talk about Biden with the leader of Ukraine, as was alleged. As the Washington Post noted, the president acknowledged this, out loud and on the record, during a brief Q&A with reporters on the White House’s South lawn.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters Sunday morning. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.” Later in Houston, Trump appeared to backtrack, saying, “I don’t even want to mention it, but certainly I’d have the right to” raise Biden’s name with Zelensky….

The Republican added yesterday that there was “no quid pro quo” with the Ukrainian leader, and while it’s unclear whether or not the assertion is true, it’s not exactly the only relevant detail in the scandal. As Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) put it yesterday, “The existence of an explicit quid pro quo – aid for interference – isn’t really the thing. If he demanded a foreign government do his political bidding, that’s when he crossed the critical threshold. No need to overthink this.”

It’s a compelling point. What we know at this point raises the specter of Trump urging a foreign government to look for – or by some measures, manufacture – damaging information Republicans could use to win an American election. We need to know whether there was a quid pro quo, but the absence of one wouldn’t make the scandal disappear.

But what surprised me over the weekend was Trump’s willingness to largely admit what he did.

It was hard not to feel a little pity for the White House’s allies who spent a few days running around telling anyone who’d listen that nothing happened, only to have Trump chop off the limb his supporters had climbed out upon.

And if this dynamic seems familiar, it’s because this president has a curious habit of getting caught up in scandals, only to admit more than he’s supposed to. As The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer noted in a piece late last year, “Donald Trump can’t stop telling on himself.”

In 2017, Trump admitted he fired then-FBI Director James Comey in the hopes of derailing a federal investigation. In 2018: he acknowledged that the pre-election hush money to his alleged former mistresses came directly from him. In 2019, he admitted that he talked to the Ukrainian president about a possible domestic rival.

And if we widen the aperture a bit, in 2016, Trump also made the notorious “Russia, if you’re listening…” comments.

The Washington Post had a report along these lines before Trump’s Sunday morning comments.

“What he’s been saying in public is the kind of thing I used to prosecute people for doing in private,” [Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor] said. Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said Trump’s confounding public behavior – for example, she said, “he says stuff in tweets that seems blatantly illegal” – allows for two competing theories. “Are we giving him too much credit and he’s just so undisciplined that he can’t help but say and tweet these things?” she asked. “Or is he so diabolical that putting it out there is like a jujitsu move?”

Overnight reporting from the Washington Post suggests his denial wasn’t true.

President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials. Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had “concerns” and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent. Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an “interagency process” but to give them no additional information – a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11.

Also last night, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, and the New York Times published similar reports, making clear that it was Trump who personally put a hold on U.S. aid to Ukraine ahead of his chat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

It doesn’t take much of an imagination to connect the dots here. The accusation has come into focus: Trump wanted Ukraine to intervene in the American election, but he needed leverage over his Ukrainian counterpart. The Republican took it upon himself to block the promised aid in the days leading up to a scheduled meeting with Zelensky, and then during the meeting, Trump leaned on the Ukrainian leader to participate in a partisan scheme intended to help keep him in power.

That administration officials received instructions to peddle a dubious cover story to Congress compounds the apparent offense. That Trump assured the public as recently as Sunday that he “didn’t delay anything” makes matters even worse.

If White House officials expect this to be a minor flap that blows over in a few days, they’re likely to be disappointed."

PELOSI TO ADDRESS GROUNDSWELL OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT CALLS INSIDE CAUCUS, AMID UKRAINE FUROR

“It is time for the Congress to formally investigate the conduct of this president,” Biden said Tuesday, saying that Trump “should stop stonewalling” House committee investigations into his alleged misconduct.

“If the president does not comply with requests from Congress … Donald Trump will leave Congress no choice, in my view, but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said.

“That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

Biden’s comments come after Trump vowed to release the transcript of a now-controversial phone call over the summer with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move came after it was confirmed that the White House froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.

The White House contended that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. Multiple administration sources told Fox News on Tuesday that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the money.

The aid to Ukraine also came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share, sources said.

Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.”

“There was no quid pro quo,” Trump said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.”

A day earlier, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions.

“No I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. … Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week, involving claims that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats nonetheless want to see the complaint.

Biden demanded that the administration make the complaint available to Congress, along with other documents and information that's been requested.

Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role, including that he apparently threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine.

As it happens, Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being overly soft on corruption. But Trump has claimed Shokin “was after” Hunter Biden, suggesting that Joe Biden was out to protect his son.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” on Monday.

“I can take the political attacks,” Biden countered Tuesday. “They’ll come and they’ll go, and in time they’ll soon be forgotten.”

“But,"" he added, ""if we allow a president to get away with shredding the U.S. Constitution, that will last forever. This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue and a security issue.”

On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.

There are now 164 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach Trump. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would then be needed to convict and remove the president.)

The research culminated in the #1 New York Times bestselling book “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends” (Harper Collins, March 2018). Below are some of the results of the investigation.

1. Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in April 2014, according to RSB bank records. Hunter Biden had little background in energy. Over a 16-month period, Burisma paid $3.1 million to a bank account associated with Hunter’s business.

2. Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s policy toward Ukraine when he served as vice president. Biden helped shape Ukraine’s energy and anti-corruption policies, issues that directly impact Burisma.

3. Burisma sought to capitalize Hunter Biden’s name and relationships. According to The New York Times, Hunter Biden helped assemble the company’s legal team, which consisted of American attorneys and consulting firms, including a former Obama Justice Department official.

6. Financial records from Morgan Stanley show numerous lines of money going into the account of “Robert H. Biden.” The funds originated from oligarchs and anonymous LLCs in Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan and elsewhere.

7. In 2013, then-Vice President Biden and his son Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days later, Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.

That would be a tragedy but a tragedy of his own making.""

Trump, on Tuesday, announced that he would release the full transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is at the center of the latest controversy Democrats have cited in their push for impeachment.

The administration reportedly suppressed a whistleblower seeking to report on Trump and Zelensky's phone call, which reportedly involved the president repeatedly urging his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Trump has denied any quid pro quo for foreign aid, but Democrats have portrayed the call as a second attempt for Trump to welcome outside interference in a presidential election.

PELOSI EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

Biden called on Trump to release the full whistleblower report to Congress and comply with other congressional requests. The administration has stonewalled congressional investigations by refusing to comply with subpoenas surrounding the Russia investigation.

While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has repeatedly resisted calls for impeachment, the Ukraine controversy appeared to change her mind. Fox News has confirmed that the speaker planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry at 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

Trump has used the whistleblower controversy to refocus attention on accusations surrounding Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings. Biden allegedly tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was probing a firm tied to his son.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the call with Zelensky, insisting that he never engaged in any quid pro quo for foreign aid.

In the piece, the recovering Hunter Biden acknowledged a longtime addiction to cocaine and alcohol. He also acknowledged frequenting prostitutes, and having other marital difficulties.

The New Yorker also detailed Hunter's two questionable business deals, including a $1.5 billion donation from a Chinese businessman to a private equity firm, BHR Partners, on whose board Hunter sat.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

""Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House,"" The New Yorker said.

The president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, maintained in a fiery accusation on Fox News Sunday that the money was donated days after the younger Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force Two.

""When he comes back ... eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict,"" he said.

President Trump has faced a whirlwind of criticism following accusations that he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family dealings, using military aid as leverage. But the controversy has also renewed scrutiny on the Biden family's questionable business dealings.

A second private equity firm founded by Biden received $3.4 million from a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings. Burisma Holdings also paid Hunter up to $50,000 a month to sit on its board.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Giuliani said when Ukrainian prosecutors investigated Burisma Holdings for corruption, then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the government to fire its head prosecutor.

""When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor who Biden approved -- you don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy is going on -- the new prosecutor dropped the case,"" Giuliani said.

The Biden camp maintains Giuliani is wrong -- that Biden, as well as other Western leaders and the International Monetary Fund, wanted the prosecutor fired because he wasn't aggressive enough in investigating the pro-Russian head of Ukraine's natural resources ministry, Mykola Zlochevsky, who also secretly headed Burisma Holdings through shell companies. It was only after the Ukraine government changed hands in a popular anti-Russian uprising that Hunter Biden was appointed to the board.

There wasn't a hint ""of scandal at all when we were there and I impose the same strict rules,"" Joe Biden said last August.

Separately, Joe Biden's brother, James Biden, is also being sued for conspiracy to defraud a business partner.

""James Biden repeatedly would try to leverage his brother Joe Biden's connections ... connections to the court systems, connections to labor unions, connections to the Department of Veterans Affairs with the hopes that ... he could get my clients lucrative contracts. But none of these promises were fulfilled,"" the plaintiff’s attorney Robert Peal, told Fox News.

An attorney representing James Biden did not respond to Fox News' request for a response. Joe Biden and his family have denied any impropriety.

""I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with our businesses. Period,"" Joe Biden said in August.

The New Yorker reported in its June piece that Hunter Biden declined a second term on Burisma Holdings' board, and that his decision to serve on the board during a first term was a mistake.

""It certainly wasn’t worth the grief,” he said. ""I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.”"

For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment.

But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”

Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral.

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS

Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump addressed his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid.

Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations.

Giuliani accused Kiev on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye.

""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?""

While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told The New Yorker that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing.""

Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

“Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don’t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.”

All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa poll.

His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family.

Earlier, Biden used the description in his own critique of the president.

""Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum,"" he told reporters in Iowa over the weekend. ""And, he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to do something to smear me.""

The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.

“I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here, in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

“Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son, Hunter, in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

The matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower's mid-August complaint, which followed Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Lawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. Trump hinted on Monday that he may release the details of the phone conversation, but said its contents mainly consisted of congratulating the new Ukrainian leader.

""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!""

Trump added: ""The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!""

Department of Justice lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News.

The dramatic ""flip-the-script"" moment could blunt Democrats' newly energized push to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, based on a whistleblower's allegation that the president pressed the new Ukrainian leader during the phone call to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter.

But Democrats were sure to continue their push for the whistleblower's full complaint and testimony, which could provide additional details. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent.

""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week.""

It was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president.

And Yahoo News reported that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had written to the whistleblower's attorney, requesting a bipartisan closed-door interview.

At the same time, the matter threatened to shine a harsh spotlight on the Bidens' activities in Ukraine, and top Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., warned the situation could ""backfire"" on Democrats.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

Top Trump surrogates, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have long said that Ukraine should investigate that matter fully.

And Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense. An administration official told the Wall Street Journal that Trump's actions on the call with Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing.""

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a ""disgrace,"" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

Still, there were other indications that releasing the transcript would not fully satisfy the growing chorus of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry. In a statement on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., strongly suggested that impeachment might be on the table if the whistleblower's full complaint was not provided to Congress.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said.

She was expected to get behind an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, a slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that the president personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before his phone call with the Ukrainian president.

Omar addressed her concerns about Biden in a new interview with The Guardian, after appearing at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday. She said the former vice president lacked the excitement necessary to inspire long-lasting change.

""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country. And I would say he is not one of them,"" she said.

Napolitano, a Fox News senior judicial analyst, had framed President Trump's earlier statement as an admission that he tried to ""solicit aid for his campaign from a foreign government.""

“So that to which the president has admitted is in and of itself a crime,” Smith followed. Napolitano responded, ""yes,"" and claimed it was the same crime former Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigated as part of the long-running Russia investigation.

Napolitano's comments came amid renewed calls for impeachment and just before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the formalization of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Tuesday. Pelosi said ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

TRUMP'S UKRAINE CONTROVERSY CAST SPOTLIGHT ON HUNTER BIDEN'S BUSINESS DEALINGS

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.

""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law.""

The move toward impeachment proceedings gained momentum after a whistleblower's allegation that the president pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. He has also denied any wrongdoing, and Shokin was widely criticized for allegedly being too soft on corruption.

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a ""disgrace,"" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

On ""Shephard Smith Reporting,"" Napolitano indicated that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, could have committed a crime if he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden in a bid to help the president's reelection efforts.

Giuliani previously said that he directed Ukraine to investigate Biden but not as part of an effort to help Trump win reelection. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to Trump's Ukraine discussions.

FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID

Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.

But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming administration of Volodymyr Zelensky was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding.

The aid to Ukraine also, according to sources, came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share.

Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.”

“There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.”

The White House’s decision to release the funding ultimately was made in mid-August, after Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, called the president and said that Ukraine desperately needed the aid, according to administration sources.

The White House, at the time, was also up against an appropriation “impoundment” deadline, which meant the money would either have to be spent, or impounded. The White House would have been forced to go to court to justify the impoundment, which sources said it did not want to do.

The White House, though, has denied the allegations that the freezing of the Ukrainian aid was tied to allegations that the president asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.

“The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this President.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations Monday, Trump also denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions.

“No, I didn’t—I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption…Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

But Democrats are concerned the president may have essentially withheld money to Ukraine as leverage to seek an investigation concerning the Bidens -- which is now prompting renewed impeachment calls.

The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role.

Nevertheless, Democrats have used the reports and new allegations against the president to press forward—even as it risks backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by Biden.

Late Monday night, a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.

The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.""

“These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.”

Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment.

There are now 154 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.)

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice for 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was first choice of 20 percent of the voters.

In June, the Register poll showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

While Biden continues to lead in national polls some are concerned about his current standing.

Co-host Jesse Watters pointed out Biden may lose multiple early primaries before he reaches states he polls strongest in.

""I've seen three polls where he's losing to either Warren or Sanders in New Hampshire,"" Watters said.

WARREN SURGES IN IOWA

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

History: “Amid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the ‘Corps of Discovery,’ featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. … On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

Roll Call: “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who has recently said he may decline to support President Trump’s reelection bid, tweeted on Sunday that it would be ‘troubling in the extreme’ if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.

In a tweet on Sunday, Romney said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine.""

Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Nunes said the details from the whistleblower complaint still have not been confirmed to Congress. He said the inspector general for the intelligence community met with lawmakers last week, but did not reveal anything.

Nunes said the committee is scheduled to meet soon with the acting director of national intelligence, where he hopes more information will be shared. He claimed the story is playing out in a similar way to the Russia collusion accusations.

We saw this throughout the Russia investigation, when the president countered the allegations of obstruction with a crusade against a witch hunt, Deep State conspiracy and fake news.

Trump is doing it again with the media and political furor over his phone call with Ukraine’s leader, trying to shift the spotlight to questionable conduct by Joe Biden and his son. And early indications are that it’s working.

BOLTON, NEOCONS HIT TRUMP FOR NOT STRIKING IRAN

Philippe Reines, the former State Department official and longtime Hillary Clinton confidant, said on “Media Buzz” that after the first round of political combat over Ukraine, Trump is the winner.

Whether that’s true or not, calling out Biden is very much the focus of the president’s counterattack against allegations that have reignited Democratic talk of impeachment.

Rudy Giuliani told me on Sunday that the political crisis is helping him accomplish what he’s been trying to do for five months, which is focus media scrutiny on the former vice president and Hunter Biden, who was paid big bucks by a Ukrainian gas giant that had come under investigation. Joe Biden has publicly bragged about pressuring Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor, who was overseeing the case—though it was not active at the time--by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees.

Giuliani pushed the Biden story on my show last April, and many other programs as well. He has also met with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to revive the Biden probe there. (No investigation has found wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.)

The president’s personal lawyer laid it out yesterday with Maria Bartiromo: “It’s the only way you can get this out. The only way they would cover this story is by punching the president in the face and then the president deflects the punch which he’s done, the story came down and then he hits with a right hand that’s more powerful.”

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

And that, in turn, is producing stories like this one the other day in the Washington Post:

“Suddenly, Biden faced two dueling realities: The president he is hoping to defeat next year — and who he describes as morally unfit for office — is under scrutiny for behavior some view as treasonous. But the story is inextricably linked to Biden’s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.”

The fact is it’s impossible to cover the furor over the Trump call without delving into the details of what at the least is Biden’s son trading on his name (as political relatives have done in every administration).

Trump bristled at Ukraine questions yesterday at the U.N., telling reporters they are ""a fake news group of people...If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the eletric chair right now."" At a time when longshot GOP rival Bill Weld is accusing him of treason, the president did not explain why Biden's actions would result in a death penalty case.

Those comments followed Trump telling reporters on Sunday that what the Wall Street Journal and others had reported about the July call was essentially true, though he insists it was totally appropriate:

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine. And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

So Trump is being accused of the same thing he’s saying Biden did in 2015, pressuring Ukraine for partisan reasons. The administration has been holding up $250 in military aid to help Ukraine fight Russian separatists. Trump says he never brought up the aid, but he didn’t have to—it’s hanging in the air.

The president said he’d “love” to release a transcript of the call with Volodymyr Zelensky, but has to figure out how to do so.

By the way, Trump was wrong when he recently tweeted that the media “want to stay as far away as possible” from the Biden allegations.

A quick search found many major stories on the matter, including:

New York Times, 2015: “Joe Biden, His Son and the Case Against a Ukrainian Oligarch”

Washington Post, 2019: “As Vice President, Biden Said Ukraine Should Increase Gas Production. Then His Son Got a Job with a Ukrainian Gas Company.”

New Yorker, 2019: “Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father’s Campaign?”

Joe Biden, for his part, angrily accused Trump over the weekend of abusing his power in an attempt to “smear” him because he knows “I’ll beat him like a drum.” Biden said he never discussed overseas business dealings with his son, which prompted Trump to call him a liar. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker they briefly discussed it once.

The more the story devolves into a partisan back-and-forth, the more it neutralizes the political danger to the president. That was the playbook against Bob Mueller.

Nancy Pelosi is under growing pressure from some previously impeachment-wary Democrats to drop her opposition in light of Ukraine. She is holding the line for now while warning the White House that failure to turn over key documents could prove the tipping point.

But Trump can easily survive—again—if he turns this into another two-sided scandal, filled with interminable details and unpronounceable names, that most Americans can’t follow."

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS

Giuliani did not provide how he learned about the purported transaction but said prosecutors were stonewalled at the time when they inquired about the sum.

""Did Obama know that his VP, the one he put in charge of giving billions to Ukraine, had a son who was making millions on the board of one of the most corrupt companies in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. ""[Hunter] Biden’s boss had stolen $5b from Ukraine and was a fugitive. Did Obama know? Did he approve?""

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump asked his Ukranian counterpart to investigate Hunter Biden, who had a key role in a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. Hunter Biden has not been accused of wrongdoing during his time at the company, where he made $50,000 a month as a member of the board of directors, according to The New York Times. Up until his role on the board, Hunter Biden had no experience in Ukraine, the Times reported.

At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden openly boasted about successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire that prosecutor when he was vice president.

Trump on Sunday appeared to confirm that he spoke about Joe Biden with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but insisted that the call was routine. Democrats seized on his admission and some renewed calls for his impeachment. Political observers raised questions as to why Trump would allow himself to get into a position that it could even appear like he is seeking help from a foreign power to achieve political ends.

Giuliani, like many Trump supporters, stressed that the story is not the phone calls, rather the crony capitalism on display where the son of a sitting vice president could make millions working on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Trump accused Joe Biden of dishonesty in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling The New Yorker magazine that they spoke “just once” about it.

Critics have been relentless in their condemnation of President Trump over a whistleblower's complaint about the context of a phone call between the president and newly elected Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky -- while ignoring allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Pence told Sean Hannity.

""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" he claimed.

Trump's conversation with Zelensky came as the Trump administration was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE 'FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE' OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT

Last week, a whistleblower complaint surfaced containing allegations Trump made a troubling and unspecified ""promise"" to a foreign leader later reported to be Zelensky -- touching off a Washington firestorm. On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation.

The whistleblower's allegation could, however, prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor wasn't fired.

It was in the political interest of President Trump that Ukraine aggressively investigate credible allegations of corruption and conflict-of-interest against former Vice President Joe Biden, a favorite among the Democratic candidates seeking to run against Trump in 2020.

The national interests of the United States and the political interests of the president are not the same thing. If President Trump conflated them in his discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, that was a failure of judgment.

But have we lost our capacity to say conduct is censurable without turning it into something it is not – such as effective immunity for Biden and grounds for Trump’s impeachment?

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Don’t get me wrong. It is not my purpose to minimize the politicization of American foreign relations. To the contrary, I just wrote a book, ""Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency."" In many ways, it is a ""cri de coeur"" for a restoration of a vital American norm. Incumbent administrations must not wield the awesome powers of the presidency, especially the powers to conduct foreign affairs and gather foreign intelligence, out of sheer partisanship.

My purpose is to place the potential wrong in context.

Let’s say, for argument’s sake, it is proven that Trump used his enormous influence over Kiev, or worse, his control over the release of defense aid Ukraine needs, strictly to better his electoral chances against Biden. That would be an abuse of power.

It would also make the 45th president, well, the 45th president in American history to exercise his powers under the influence of his political standing. That is particularly true of presidents seeking reelection, even if we suspect that most exploitations of foreign relations power for electoral advantage have been less crude than Trump’s alleged squeezing of Ukraine.

On that score, we must note that Trump denies exerting pressure and Ukraine denies that it felt pressured. Moreover, reports indicate that while the president urged his counterpart, repeatedly, to look into Biden’s alleged corruption, Trump did not explicitly tie that request to a release of $250 million in U.S. defense aid – although that aid, previously approved by Congress, was being slow-walked for reasons the administration has yet to explain.

Still, even if we assume that the president delayed the aid in order to spur Kiev regarding Biden, that hardly means Biden’s conduct and patent conflict-of-interest do not rate scrutiny.

In one of his notorious speak-first-think-later flourishes, Biden openly bragged that, as President Obama’s vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in financial aid Kiev desperately needed as a quid pro quo to extort Ukraine’s government into firing a prosecutor.

As the invaluable investigative journalist Peter Schweizer outlined in a Fox News column, this prosecutor was investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company that had put Biden’s son, Hunter, on its board under circumstances strongly suggesting it was currying favor with the then-vice president. Hunter Biden was lavishly compensated, notwithstanding that he had no discernible expertise in the energy sector.

Ukraine, moreover, is no one-off. Rudy Giuliani, the president’s private lawyer (who hired me as a prosecutor more years ago than either of us would care to remember), has pointed out that Hunter Biden accompanied Biden on Air Force Two for a trip to China about U.S. government business that apparently turned into an eye-popping $1.5 billion windfall for the then-vice president’s son. That is, Biden proved quite accommodating as the Obama administration’s point-man on relations with Beijing, and Beijing quickly made an astonishing injection of capital into an investment firm started by Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz (the stepson of then-Secretary of State John Kerry).

As Schweizer details in his important book, ""Secret Empires,"" the Communist Chinese government became a partner in the venture, as did a Massachusetts-based consultancy firm headed by James Bulger – son of the powerful former Massachusetts state senator Billy Bulger, and nephew and namesake of the notorious mobster Whitey Bulger.

That Trump may have been ham-handed in raising Biden allegations in the context of U.S.-Ukrainian relations does not mean Biden should get a pass. Indeed, if these activities involved a son of Donald Trump rather than Joe Biden, The New York Times and The Washington Post would already have assigned the usual five or 10 alpha-journalists apiece, and we’d already have been treated to the usual breathless hourly updates on CNN and MSNBC.

Obviously, a president can be in the wrong without being impeachable. Impeachment is a political remedy. It is a nonstarter in the absence of broad, bipartisan public support, which is plainly lacking in Trump’s case.

Political wrongs, if they are established, must be measured against the conduct of past presidents. Extensive investigations are underway of the Obama administration’s exploitation of foreign relations and foreign intelligence powers to influence the 2016 election – favoring Hillary Clinton and targeting Trump. Presumably, these investigations are inquiring into the relationship between the Obama administration and Ukraine. That relationship involved not only dropping an investigation of Hunter Biden’s company, but revving up an investigation of Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman. (At least, he was until media leaks sourced to Ukrainian officials resulted in his ouster.)

If Trump abused his powers, he was wrong to do so. It will make his reelection bid more difficult. But let’s not pretend he would the first to play this unsavory game.

Trump heads into three-day visit to the United Nations, will host summit on religious freedom

President Trump heads into a three-day visit to the United Nations in New York City starting on Monday facing questions over several issues: whether he sought help from Ukraine to damage potential 2020 presidential election opponent Joe Biden, growing tension with Iran, the U.S.-China trade war, a weakened global economy, stalled nuclear negotiations with North Korea and the future of Brexit.

Trump will host a summit Monday on religious freedom. His speech will present the U.S. as an alternative to authoritarianism and underline his ""commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedom,"" administration officials said Friday during a briefing call, according to Axios. Trump will not attend a U.N. meeting Monday on climate change. On Tuesday, Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 16 other world leaders will attend a U.N. General Assembly meeting.

Nunes says whistleblower controversy could have unintended casualty: Joe Biden's 2020 campaign

On Sunday, Trump addressed reports that a whistleblower complaint may have accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, and insisted that there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with the substance of the discussion.

The president reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests, but he did point fingers at Biden.

The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. In the past, Joe Biden has said the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to his son's case. Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke “just once” about it.

In an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the whistleblower complaint will have unintended consequences and shine light on Joe Biden's own misconduct - and ultimately end his 2020 campaign.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump amounted to a major ""national scandal,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching because of the reported whistleblower complaint against the president. Pelosi, who has long resisted calls to impeach Trump because the move would imperil the electability of moderate Democrats in the House, the whistleblower who alleged Trump acted improperly in his phone call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided.

Blackface scandal damages Trudeau at polls as he vows lower taxes, cellphone costs

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday worked to start putting last week’s blackface scandal behind him and focused on policies he said he’d pursue if re-elected, including lower cellphone costs and a middle-class tax cut, according to reports. However, the scandal may have torpedoed his lead in the polls.

Trudeau apologized several times for the multiple images that emerged last week showing him in blackface at different parties and events while he was in his teens and 20s. But pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research told Reuters that polls have shifted and the gap between his campaign and the opposition Conservatives has narrowed. Graves said he will release the poll numbers later this week, but told the news outlet that Trudeau’s lead has “evaporated almost overnight.”

Karl then said there are people on Trump’s team urging him to release the transcript of the now-infamous phone call.

Trump was accused of pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden in connection with his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday against accusations that Trump pressured Zelensky over Hunter Biden while also holding back nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.

Starr, a former independent counsel and U.S. solicitor general, responded on ""America's Newsroom"" to Democrats who are demanding that the White House release the transcript of the call.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

""Not at this time. I don't think there should be a rush. There are dangers, the precedent of any president making public transcripts of confidential conversations,"" he said.

Starr said all calls between a U.S. president and a foreign leader are ""sensitive,"" suggesting a negotiated solution between the White House and the Senate Intelligence Committee in the interest of ""accountability and checks and balances.""

""There are different ways of calibrating and negotiating this, but don't rush to publish,"" Starr cautioned the White House.

""We live, I know, in the age of transparency. But that has to be balanced against an enduring presidential interest in carrying on the foreign policy of the United States in a responsible way.""

Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board.

Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role."

The source said that it is made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials are on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower is not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way.

Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden family’s dealings, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

The new details, though, have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times had to amend an explosive story on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode.

On Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime,” GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said.

CNN first reported on questions about the whistleblower's direct knowledge of communications with Ukraine's leader.

In spite of those questions, the complaint has resulted in a showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire refused to share details of it with lawmakers. Democrats are pressing for the release of documents related to the complaint. Biden on Monday tweeted, ""release the transcript of the call.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“I write to urge that you and the Senate Republican majority take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the administration’s handling of security assistance to Ukraine,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment inspired by other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

But in a letter last week, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision.""

The inspector general for the intelligence community has clashed with the ODNI on the matter, however, and has advocated for the complaint's release to Congress.

Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to return focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed Biden’s son, Hunter, improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner.

Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Bill Weld, who is challenging President Trump in the Republican primaries, proclaimed Monday that the president committed treason through his controversial phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- adding that the punishment for treason is death.

The statement drew a swift rebuke from the Trump campaign.

“The media’s affliction with Trump Derangement Syndrome has driven them into an actual discussion of the proposed execution of the President of the United States,” communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. “In severe cases of TDS such as this, immediate consultation with a physician is recommended.”

LONG-SHOT GOP PRIMARY CHALLENGERS TO HAVE THEIR OWN DEBATE THIS MONTH -- MINUS TRUMP

Weld was responding to claims that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden -- the son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden -- and threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine as leverage. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

“Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn’t be clearer. And that’s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason,"" Weld said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""It’s treason pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That’s the only penalty.”

Weld then referred to impeachment as a possible alternative to a criminal case, stating, “The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.”

Weld’s mention of the death penalty later ignited a conversation about the “legal framework” of the claim. Weld again said, “The only penalty for treason is death, it’s spelled out in the statute.”

While the U.S. Code does list the death penalty as a punishment for treason, Weld’s claim that it is the only penalty is false. Treason is covered by 18. U.S. Code § 2381, which says that a person guilty of treason “shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”

When Fox News asked Weld’s campaign about this, they did not immediately respond.

Weld's comments came during a joint television appearance with the two other longshot Republicans challenging Trump in next year's primary: former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh. They have joined together to protest the canceling of GOP presidential primaries in some states in 2020."

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”



THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.”



DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”

I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

The September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of voters dislike Trump. That is a toxic level in any race let alone one for the presidency.

It is impossible to improve that sentiment to less than 50 percent in the remaining 14 months before the 2020 election. Prior to this poll, the highest dislike of a president was 42 percent for George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in March 2006.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: WHAT IS TRUMP-BIDEN CLASH OVER UKRAINE AND WHISTLEBLOWER ALL ABOUT?

In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies.

Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American.

It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month.

Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government.

However, if these reports are true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner.

Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive.

In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems.

In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States.

However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will have little real effect.

It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed.

It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and that no one can or will stop him … again.

If that is true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion.

He should be held accountable. Every member of Congress and every American should stand up to Trump and for the rule of law.

Richard Painter, the former White House ethics lawyer for President George W.

But when asked about Trump's ""attempted collusion"" with Ukraine, Painter declared it was an ""impeachable offense.""

“This is an impeachable offense, turning the powers of a foreign government against a candidate in the United States who is a political rival of Donald Trump, this in and of itself is impeachable,” Painter said. “This president has committed multiple high crimes and misdemeanors and what is happening when the House refuses to impeach him, he continues to do more and more of it.”

REP. AL GREEN WARNS DEMS: 'THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO TURN ON US' IF WE DON'T IMPEACH TRUMP

Painter went on to say that Trump ""feels emboldened"" as House Democrats remain stagnant on impeachment and gave a grim forecast for the Democratic Party if they don't take action.

“As Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi doesn’t have the courage to impeach him, he’s going to keep on doing it. He is getting a pass from this Congress,"" Painter continued. ""It’s critically important that the House not only start impeachment investigations formally but that they vote out articles of impeachment, all of the evidence is already there. We don’t need more to impeach this president and if they don’t do it, I think the Democrats are going to lose in 2020, and probably deserve to lose.”

The debate among Democrats over Trump's impeachment was revived last week after it was reported that a whistleblower from the intelligence community flagged what was being described as a ""troubling"" interaction the president had with a foreign leader. It was later reported that Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden's son and the president has since been accused of leveraging financial aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on the 2020 Democratic frontrunner."

""I think that the most interesting aspect of this is, you know, we're talking a lot about what the whistleblower knew or didn't know firsthand ... but the fact is that President Trump and his staff have said quite a lot since Sunday in trying to explain or defend what they did that puts a lot of meat on the bones,"" Wallace told ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier.

""The fact is that the president says that in that introductory or in that congratulatory phone call with the president-elect at that time of Ukraine... He did talk about Joe Biden and his son and possible corruption and expressed some concerns about wanting the Ukrainian president to look into that.""

Wallace then pointed to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway's remarks on ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning confirming the report that Trump had asked Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to halt military aid to Ukraine prior to that July phone call.

""It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES A FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

This came as House Democrats officially launched a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday afternoon, fueled by a whistleblower’s accusation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his potential 202O opponent, Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. The whistleblower alleged that Trump had ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before his phone call with Zelensky. The whistleblower said Trump told Zelensky that he would not release the aid unless he investigated Biden.

A source familiar with the situation has told Fox News the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call and Trump has agreed to release a transcript on Wednesday. Trump has denied any wrongdoing on the call.

""Quite frankly, I’m sick of hearing everybody b---h about it. Just do it,"" she said.

A growing number of House Democrats have supported an impeachment probe against Trump after it was revealed that the administration froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before the president allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The president said Tuesday that he would release an unredacted transcript of the phone call.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA ‘FRENZY’

Dingell told Fox News’ ""Outnumbered Overtime” that if Trump did not make investigating Biden a condition of releasing the aid, then why did the White House block it being provided to the two intelligence committees?”



“Now we get information that the Inspector General for Homeland Security determined that there was a real credible threat to our national security,” she added.

Dingell's endorsement of an impeachment inquiry marks a change for the third-term congresswoman. In March, she told ""Fox News Sunday"" that "" I do not think an impeachment should ever be a partisan event. I think we need to have Republicans and Democrats or it will tear this country apart. It's a very serious movement.""

Administration sources told Fox News that the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Those sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding.

Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate dealings involving 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats have been moving full steam ahead, calling for the whistleblower complaint to be released to lawmakers.

SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE ‘FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE’ OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT

“The Senate Republican ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. “This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.”

The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.

In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week.

“It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,” McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an “appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner.”

In a statement Monday, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley called for lawmakers not to rush to judgment.

“One thing we do know is that rampant speculation by politicians and the media is not helpful,” he said. “That’s how the false Russia collusion narrative took root.”

He added: “Let’s not repeat the mistakes of the past. Going forward, it’s important to respect the law and the whistleblower’s confidentiality while we gather the facts of the case. And of course, transparency is always the best policy so long as we don’t endanger national security.”

On Wednesday, Democrats chairing three House committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking the department to produce documents related to the complaint, or face subpoenas.

“Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,” the chairmen wrote. “Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.”

The letter was sent by Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland.

At least one Republican lawmaker, however, has called for the release of the transcript.

“At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic.

Meanwhile, a source told Fox News on Monday that the whistleblower who sparked the complaint did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation. The source said that it was made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky.

Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation or learned of it another way.

These new details have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times amended an explosive article on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode.

On Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime,” GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah on Monday likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said.

Republicans also have been trying to return the focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed son Hunter improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner.

Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Burisma hired Hunter Biden in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted amid protests and as his father was involved heavily in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Many critics in Ukraine and the West had accused Shokin of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But, the controversy flew largely under the radar until last week. While the heat has been on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.

""The horse is out of the barn,"" said former Hillary Clinton pollster and strategist Geoff Garin. ""Saddle up.""

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. He also called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a ""disgrace,"" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and an administration official told the Journal that Trump's actions on the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing.""

Another official told the paper that the Trump administration internally maintained at the time that Ukraine's corruption problems were a consideration in the aid decision. Trump's decision to freeze Ukraine funding reportedly came more than a week before his call with Zelensky.

""The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up."" — Geoff Garin

Fox News has not independently confirmed the reports, which rocked Capitol Hill even as Democrats insisted they were keeping the developments in perspective. While Democrats are set to meet Tuesday to discuss Ukraine and possible impeachment proceedings, the top House aide told Fox News that trade – not Ukraine – would headline Democrats' agenda at a separate planned caucus meeting Wednesday.

""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade,"" the aide told Fox News. ""A second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon.""

Something of an impeachment inquiry dam broke late Monday, when seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it's impeachable. The lawmakers – Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia – come largely from swing districts where Trump is popular but voters split.

The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.""

“These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.”

Later in the night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell also endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could quickly lead to actual impeachment.

""On behalf of the people who elected us, we must formalize and accelerate the impeachment process so that Congress, by exercising its responsibility under Article 1 of the Constitution, can provide some measure of accountability,"" Schatz said in a statement.

The flurry of moves brings to 154 the number of House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.)

Democrats have presented conflicting views, in court and in public, as to whether impeachment proceedings are already in progress. The renewed push on Monday could galvanize remaining Democrats to openly call their efforts an impeachment probe.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

Meanwhile, a report in Politico late Monday suggested that Democrats may vote on a resolution to condemn Trump for allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leadership to investigate possible corruption by Joe Biden's son Hunter relating to his business dealings in the country.

And The Washington Post reported in the evening that Pelosi was sounding out members of the Democratic caucus to see if the time has come to impeach the president.

However, earlier Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of Trump's conversation with Zelensky.

The source said that it was made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call.

Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

Nevertheless, Democrats have pressed forward on the issue, even as it risked backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by the former vice president.

""The Senate Republican 'see no evil, hear no evil' attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. ""This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.""

The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.

At least one Republican lawmaker has also called for the release of the transcript of Trump's call.

""At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic and onetime presidential rival.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY BOILS OVER ON SENATE FLOOR

Meanwhile, top Republicans including California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted in interviews with Fox News that the gambit would backfire for Democrats.

And in an exclusive interview with Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said Democrats' accusations were about to boomerang.

""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence claimed.

Late Sunday evening, Trump sounded a similar note, tweeting the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.""

Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. The prosecutor, at the time, was investigating possible corruption involving a natural gas firm with close ties to Hunter Biden.

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

At the same time, Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.""

The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

The whistleblower drama kicked into gear after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. Democrats have sought the full whistleblower complaint and testimony from the whistleblower.

But Maguire has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., warned Sunday. ""Thank you for your patriotism.""

Pelosi went on: ""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest.""

Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have hard evidence that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia.

""Why doesn’t the president just say, 'Release the whistleblower complaint.' Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,"" Schiff said. ""This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.""

The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery tweet: ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.""

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

TRUMP ADMIN CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA 'FRENZY'

But in the wake of reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, numerous congressional Democrats have publicly backed an impeachment inquiry. This includes some centrist members and senior Democratic lawmakers who had earlier shied away from such calls.

The disagreements are likely to come to a head at a caucus meeting late Tuesday afternoon, where Fox News is told she'll announce a formal impeachment inquiry.

“She’s all but out of options,” a Democratic source told Fox News ahead of the meeting.

Speaking at a Washington forum with Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Pelosi confirmed she’d be making an announcement at 5 p.m. ET, without going into specifics.

However, she seemed to set the table for an impeachment-related statement, accusing the director of national intelligence of “breaking the law” at the administration’s direction by not releasing a related whistleblower complaint.

As for concerns about the political implications of moving on impeachment, Pelosi said: “This is about patriotism.”

“The president is making lawlessness a virtue in this country,” Pelosi said.

She even argued that it won’t be necessary to prove Trump delivered a “quid pro quo” – a comment that came as Trump announced, via Twitter, that he’ll be releasing a transcript of the phone call in question.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has already launched what he's described as impeachment proceedings, including a hearing last week featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. But the Democratic source suggested Democrats are frustrated with Nadler’s approach, and looking for more action.

“He’s not been able to deliver accountability surrounding the litany of crimes committed by the Trump syndicate,” the source told Fox News.

A senior House Democratic source told Fox News there even has been discussion of a select committee to conduct an impeachment inquiry against Trump -- a move that would take it out of Nadler's hands. But the situation is fluid and other sources say they are waiting to hear from Pelosi during the caucus meeting.

By Tuesday, even senior members of the caucus were joining the impeachment chorus.

In an emotional speech on the House floor, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., called for an impeachment investigation, saying he ""has waited.”

“Sometimes I’m afraid to go to sleep for fear that I will wake up and our democracy will be gone, will be gone, and never return,” he said. “This administration demonstrates complete disregard and disdain for ethics, for the law and for the constitution. They have lied under oath, they have refused to account for their action and appear before (a) legislative body, who have the constitutional right to inquire about their activities.”

He added: “We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act.”

“The future of our democracy is at stake. There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect, preserve the integrity of our nation,” he continued. “I believe, I surely believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.”

The new impeachment wave began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint.

The discussions apparently involved efforts to pressure Ukraine to look into a separate controversy involving the Biden family.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role.

At issue now is whether Trump sought to withhold military aid as leverage in seeking an inquiry.

Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. But administration sources said this was tied to concerns about corruption and other issues.

Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.”

“There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.”

FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID

But amid the reports about the frozen Ukraine aid money, late Monday night a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.

The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.""

Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment.

There are now 164 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.)

The speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act. The move could help Democrats' disputed arguments in court that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents.

Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

But there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi's gambit could backfire, as Republicans predicted over the weekend.

""It is a colossal error."" — Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn

Trump vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky by Wednesday.

Additionally, a senior administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the White House is working as quickly as it can to release to Congress a whistleblower complaint, as long as it's legally possible. The official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing,

The Wall Street Journal reported that the complaint must be declassified first, but will likely be in Congress' hands by the end of the week.

And The New York Times reported that the White House had dropped its objection to the whistleblower speaking to Congress. That came after the GOP-controlled Senate passed a unanimous resolution seeking access to the whistleblower's complaint.

WATCH BIDEN RECOUNT HOW HE PUSHED FOR SHOKIN'S FIRING

Still, Pelosi appeared undeterred -- and she and other Democrats suggested to reporters that impeachment could be appropriate even for matters unrelated to the Ukraine probe.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.

""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law.""

Invoking the ""darkest days of the American Revolution,"" Pelosi called on lawmakers to honor their constitutional oath to protect the country ""from all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

The Democratic-led committees then would gather evidence and present it to Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote.

A Democratic source told Fox News that the House Intelligence Committee, led by California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, would take the lead in the investigation -- and that Nadler might not be pleased with the arrangement.

“I don’t think he’s happy that he has less influence here, but everybody is on the same page and has the same role,” the source said of Nadler.

Schiff “will have a heavy role here because the foundation of the Ukraine allegations is thorough his committee,"" the source said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., responded to Pelosi's statement by noting that Democrats have been pushing to impeach Trump for years, for a variety of reasons.

""Nancy Pelosi may be Speaker of the House,"" McCarthy said, ""but she does not speak for America. ... What she said today made no difference in what's been going on. This election is over. It's time to put the public before politics.""

Trump, for his part, ripped into Democrats in a series of tweets immediately after Pelosi's comments, writing that ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT"" was in progress again.

""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,"" Trump wrote. ""So bad for our Country!""

He added: ""They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!""

Trump is set to meet with Zelensky in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters.

House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called Democrats' efforts predictable and destructive in his own fiery statement.

""Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the beginning of this Congress,"" Jordan said. ""Michael Cohen's testimony was a bust. John Dean's testimony was a waste of time. The Mueller report did not live up to the hype.

""Speaker Pelosi's decision to pursue impeachment now - on the basis of unsubstantiated, indirect, and anonymous allegations - only shows that the Speaker has finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the socialist wing of the Democrat Party,"" Jordan added. ""This was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions. It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people.""

Pelosi had met Tuesday afternoon with her caucus of House Democrats prior to giving the planned statement.

Wary of compromising the electability of vulnerable Democrats in the caucus, Pelosi had long resisted taking the dramatic step publicly -- even though other top Democrats have insisted, in legal filings and the media, that an impeachment inquiry already has been in progress for months.

Swing district Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., acknowledged to Fox News that supporting the impeachment inquiry ""could"" affect her electorally, but she maintained that Trump voters in her district ""understand,"" and that Trump crossed a red line.

Republicans said the move would prove to be a major political mistake.

TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT

""It is a colossal error,"" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn told Fox News just prior to Pelosi's comments. ""And, I’m kind of surprised that Speaker Pelosi, as shrewd as she is, would let it get to this point.""

Pelosi's impeachment imprimatur came after a flurry of those swing-district Democrats late Monday wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post backing an impeachment inquiry, or a fact-finding look at whether an impeachment vote by the full House is warranted. And on Saturday night, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Democrats' failure to act on impeachment had been a ""national scandal.""

Pelosi's decision Tuesday heartened Democrats who have long called for impeaching the president, only to be stalled after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign.

But, new momentum built quickly for the move after news of the whistleblower complaint surfaced.

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a ""disgrace,"" acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

BIDEN CAMPAIGN LIKELY TO END, AS UKRAINE ISSUE WILL 'BACKFIRE,' NUNES SAYS

Trump tweeted Tuesday that he would make a ""complete"" transcript of his phone call public on Wednesday.

""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!""

Justice Department lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News.

At an event Tuesday, Pelosi intimated that impeachment would remain on the table, regardless of what the transcript showed. Many conservatives charged that she was moving the goalposts and lowering expectations.

""We have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses in terms of the Constitution, but this one is the most understandable by the public,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Ukraine phone call allegation. ""It's really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid-pro-quo in the conversation.""

Other prominent Democrats also seemingly said Trump should be impeached no matter what.

""The president has committed several impeachable offenses,"" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters after Pelosi's remarks on impeachment. In another indication that Democrats were apparently hedging their bets on the Ukraine matter, Ocasio-Cortez said alleged Emoluments Clause violations by the president could be included in prospective articles of impeachment.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

Democrats continued to push for the whistleblower to testify and to see the full whistleblower complaint throughout the day. Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent.

""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week.""

It was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's call with Zelensky.

Late Monday, attorneys for the whistleblower released a statement confirming Schiff's statement, and noting that they ""await a timely response from the Acting Director providing such guidance.""

""We support the bi-partisan, unanimous resolution passed by the Senate regarding our client’s lawful whistleblower complaint and call upon the Acting Director of National Intelligence to transmit the complete disclosure to the two Intelligence Oversight Committees,"" the lawyers noted.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

As Pelosi met with her caucus, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, called for the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to immediately have access to the whistleblower complaint. The panels ""should be allowed to evaluate the complaint in a deliberate and bipartisan manner consistent with applicable statutes and processes in order to safeguard classified and sensitive information,"" Schumer asserted.

Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., also released a joint statement Tuesday announcing an imminent resolution condemning the White House's failure to turn over all related documents to Congress.

""Allegations that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals – and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation – are deeply alarming,"" Hoyer and Pelosi wrote.

They demanded the whistleblower's protection, and for ""the Acting Director of National Intelligence [to] provide Congress the [whistleblower] complaint, as specified under the law, and all requests for documents and testimony relating to this allegation.""

PENCE RIPS BIDEN OVER UKRAINE HYPOCRISY IN 'HANNITY' INTERVIEW

Pelosi and Hoyer continued: ""On Wednesday, the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress’s disapproval of the Administration’s effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower. This is not a partisan matter, it’s about the integrity.""

Meanwhile, Yahoo News reported that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had written to the whistleblower's attorney, requesting a closed-door interview.

The precise implications of Pelosi's shift on impeachment were unclear, given Democrats' previous rhetoric on the topic. Earlier this month, Hoyer contradicted some of his colleagues by insisting that Congress is not engaged in any kind of ""impeachment inquiry"" -- before reversing course hours later in a ""clarifying"" press statement.

Other top Democrats, including Nadler, have insisted repeatedly in court and in public that an impeachment inquiry has been in progress.

“It has been an impeachment inquiry,” Nadler has said. “What we are doing is clear. It has been very clear. It continues to be very clear.""

But, when asked if he thought it was an impeachment inquiry, Hoyer initially responded with an emphatic “No.”

Hoyer added: “I think the delineation ought to be whether or not they are considering a resolution of impeachment.”

The Justice Department, in court filings earlier this month, sought to block congressional Democrats' bid for secret grand jury material from the Mueller investigation by citing the confusion inside the caucus over whether or not they're pursuing an ""impeachment investigation.""

""The committee’s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,"" the DOJ said.

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled strong support for an impeachment inquiry -- 235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one pro-impeachment independent. A majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario.

""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence told Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Monday.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and possibly using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests – but that didn’t stop Bernstein from comparing it to Watergate.

“If the reporting of Shane Harris and the Wall Street Journal is accurate, and it seems to be, it clearly moved toward a grievous abuse of power by the President of the United States. I keep getting asked, ‘Are there echoes of Watergate in this?’ There are in the following ways,” Bernstein said Sunday. “Watergate was very much an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the Democratic electoral process.”

Bernstein said that Nixon used “political espionage and sabotage” to nominate George McGovern, who Nixon considered the “weakest candidate,” as opposed to Edmund Muskie.

BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON

Back in 1972, Bernstein and Bob Woodward reported that a White House aide fabricated a letter detailing Muskie condoning a racial slur against Americans of French-Canadian descent, which derailed his campaign.

“Something of the same thing seems to be happening here where Biden, who Trump and his people have said they fear the most, in terms of being an opponent, has been the object of these, perhaps, dirty tricks,” Bernstein continued. ""One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a grievous offense if this is what happened.”

Bernstein, along with Woodward, helped take down President Nixon with Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal in the Washington Post.

The impeachment debate was renewed last week after a ""whistleblower"" raised an issue about a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which the president reportedly attempted to leverage financial aid in exchange for an investigation into Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.

The Texas lawmaker, who was one of the first on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment, continued his efforts at a pro-impeachment rally.

""If we don’t do this rather quickly, the public is going to turn on us,"" Green told the crowd. ""And we are going to find that those who went to the polls and gave us this great majority are going to be very disappointed. They are not going to side with us when we did not side with them.""

Last month, Green blasted the president, calling him ""unfit"" and ""unworthy"" to serve as commander-in-chief.

""To defeat him at the polls would do history a disservice, would do our nation a disservice, and would not allow us to do what they did in 1868 when Andrew Johnson, who was the bigot of his time, who was impeached by the radical Republicans,"" Green said. ""We can’t let him walk the Earth without that stain... He’s caused harm to society. We need to do something about it.”

Green also expressed his concern earlier this year that Trump would be reelected if Congress didn't impeach him.

""If we don't impeach him, he will say that he has been vindicated, he will say the Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the House and they didn't take up impeachment.

""Whether or not there are grounds for impeachment is a different matter.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

The push for impeachment has picked up steam in recent days, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning.

In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

GET THE FOX NEWS APP

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on reports that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's family’s dealings, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

Continuing to react on Twitter, the ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" host claimed lawmakers' push for the transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky has brought up important legal and ethical questions.

In its original story Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that, in the phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden -- a son of the former Delaware senator. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.

The source said that it is made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the call between Trump and Zelensky.

Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials are on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower is not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way.

""It depends on what funds we withhold,"" Schiff replied, calling it a ""blunt remedy"" that he'd be reluctant to use.

""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious...but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer.""

Trump is facing renewed calls for his impeachment from some Democrats over a phone call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July.

The story was first reported by the Washington Post as a whistleblower claim about Trump making an improper ""promise"" to a foreign leader. Further reporting claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden's son and his business dealings.

Biggs said he's skeptical of the accusations against Trump since Schiff is leading the charge.

""Look who's promoting this. This is Adam Schiff really pushing this. His credibility, veracity should be challenged,"" he said, noting that Ukraine's foreign minister denied pressure was exerted by Trump. ""The fact that he leaks stuff as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that's a problem, too.""

Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who has recently said he may decline to support President Trump’s reelection bid, tweeted on Sunday that it would be ""troubling in the extreme"" if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.

In a tweet on Sunday, Romney said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine.""

Gabbard, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in a crowded field, said on ""Fox & Friends"" that she has been consistent in saying that victory in the 2020 election, not impeachment, is the way for Democrats to make sure Trump leaves office.

""I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided. The hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart,"" she told host Brian Kilmeade.

Gabbard's comments are in contrast to many of her Democratic colleagues, including Warren, one of the top contenders in the presidential race.

In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

“If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now. “Look at the double standards. You people ought to be ashamed of yourself. And not all. We have some great journalists around. But you got a lot of crooked journalists. You’re crooked as hell. “Okay. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed it.”

To the extent that reality still has any meaning, Joe Biden didn’t do anything wrong. There’s no evidence whatsoever of any misdeeds. I don’t agree with every decision the former vice president ever made, and I don’t agree with every position he’s ever taken, but those looking for real controversies surrounding the Democratic candidate will need to look elsewhere.

The idea that Biden committed some kind of capital offense, deserving of execution, is as indefensible as it is ridiculous.

That said, if the president is eager to talk about “double standards,” let’s take a short stroll down that road.

National Review, a prominent conservative outlet, published an item late last week, that raised a straightforward observation: “There is not a Republican alive who would find it acceptable for a Democratic president to press a foreign country to work with his personal lawyer to investigate a domestic political rival.”

I can appreciate why so many on the right break out in a cold sweat every time someone like me says, “Imagine if Obama did this…” but under the circumstances, with Trump urging the public to consider the scandal from the other direction, specifically calling on us to “look at the double standards,” let’s go ahead and take the president’s advice.

Imagine it’s 2011. Barack Obama’s approval ratings are in the low-to-mid 40s; Nate Silver considers him an underdog in his re-election bid; and the Democratic White House sees Mitt Romney as a credible electoral threat.

Then imagine Obama personally puts a hold on foreign aid to a foreign country, has a meeting with that country’s president, and with very little subtlety, tells his counterpart how eager he is to see an investigation into one of Romney’s sons. In fact, in this hypothetical, Obama has also dispatched his lawyer to help lobby the foreign government, all in the hopes of acquiring dirt on the Democrat’s domestic rival.

Almost immediately thereafter, Trump insisted that his call with the Ukrainian leader was innocent and innocuous.

Indeed, Trump announced yesterday that he’d authorized the release of an “unredacted transcript” of the call, which he said would prove that it was nothing more than “a very friendly and totally appropriate call,” in which he asserted “no pressure” on his foreign counterpart.

This morning, the Republican added, “Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?”

I have a very strong hunch that those waiting for an apology will be waiting a very long time.

President Donald Trump, in a midsummer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked him to look into why that country’s top prosecutor apparently had ended an investigation of the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

The entirety of the document is available online here (pdf), posted to the White House’s website. It is not an actual, literal transcript, but the memo purports to give a rough approximation of what the two leaders discussed during their 30-minute July 25 phone call.

And after reading it, I haven’t the foggiest idea why Trump or anyone in his orbit would think it’s good for him.

Some of the details that stood out for me:

* Trump twice told Zelenskiy that the United States has been “very, very good” to Ukraine, shortly before the American president asks for a political “favor” from his counterpart.

* Trump argued, “I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.” He seemed to be referring to a prosecutor who’d been the subject of international condemnations for staggering ineptitude.

* Trump urged Zelenskiy to cooperate with Rudy Giuliani, who was trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man,” the memo quotes the American president saying. “He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”

* Speaking of the attorney general, Trump also suggested Zelenskiy should coordinate with Bill Barr: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.”

* Trump also appears to have referenced “servers” and “Crowdstrike,” suggesting he expected Ukraine to also help dig up dirt related to Hillary Clinton’s emails.

Far from an exoneration, the newly released memo points to an American president pressing the leader of Ukraine to work with his team on targeting a domestic political rival.

What’s more, this damaging revelation is only a piece of a larger puzzle – and the emerging picture may yet look worse if/when we see the complaint from the intelligence community’s whistleblower.

The case for Trump’s impeachment just got stronger."

Bernie Sanders is third with 16%, and Pete Buttigieg, at 7%, was the only other candidate above 5%. In August, Quinnipiac showed Biden leading Warren by 13 points.

* Also of interest from the same poll: among African-American Democrats, Biden’s lead over Warren in July was 49 points. Now, it’s 21 points.

* To the surprise of no one, Donald Trump’s political operation is trying to raise money off the House Democrats’ impeachment effort.

* In New Hampshire, a Monmouth poll released yesterday showed Warren narrowly leading Biden, 27% to 25%. Sanders is third with 12%, followed by Buttigieg at 10%. No other candidate reached double digits.

* In California, a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, conducted for the Los Angeles Times, found Warren leading Biden, 29% to 22%. Sanders was third with 19%, while Kamala Harris, in her home state, was fourth with 8%.

* The former vice president has not, however, lost his lead in all of the latest polls: a national Emerson poll released yesterday showed Biden narrowly leading Warren, 25% to 23%, with Sanders very close behind at 22%. As Rachel noted on last night’s show, this is the same poll that found Andrew Yang at 8%.

* Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, still struggling to break through in the Democratic presidential race, endorsed the impeachment process against Trump yesterday. Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang reached the same conclusion yesterday. Tulsi Gabbard, however, criticized impeachment as “divisive.”

* Speaking of the Hawaii congresswoman, Gabbard was at 2% support in New Hampshire in the aforementioned Monmouth poll, which appears to qualify her for next month’s presidential primary debate.

* And with just six weeks remaining before Kentucky’s gubernatorial election, incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) shook up his campaign leadership this week, shifting operational control to Michael Antonopoulos, a longtime GOP strategist."

John Lewis (D-Ga.) – a man who’s been described as “the conscience of Congress” – adding his voice to the chorus.

“There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation,” the Georgia Democrat said on the House floor today. “I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come.”

As of this minute, I believe there are now 152 House Democrats and one House independent on board with the idea, though these numbers are subject to change at any moment. For those keeping score, there are currently 235 House Dems, which means 65% of the conference – very nearly a two-thirds majority – supports, at a minimum, pursuing presidential impeachment.

Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the few top 2020 contenders who hasn’t endorsed impeachment, will reportedly announce today that if Trump refuses to comply with Congress’ investigations, lawmakers will have no choice but to draw articles. (The other most recent Democratic vice president, Al Gore, also suggested yesterday he supports an impeachment process.)

And in case this weren’t quite enough, Senate Democrats are starting to climb aboard the same train. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) endorsed Trump’s impeachment yesterday, and early this morning, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) issued a written statement along the same lines.

“It is now my belief that the House of Representatives must begin an impeachment inquiry into the president’s corrupt efforts to press a foreign nation into the service of his reelection campaign. As part of the inquiry, the House should take steps to assure that the pending whistleblower complaint be presented to Congress in full, and an investigation must take place into the full extent of the Trump administration’s demands that the Ukrainian government become agents of the president’s political agenda. If, as it appears Mr. Trump has already acknowledged, the president violated his oath of office by using the constitutional powers entrusted to him to try to destroy a political rival, then the president much be impeached. “I am deeply sorry that our nation must begin this journey toward impeachment. Up until these recent developments, I had resisted calling for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, choosing instead to allow the House to consider its options free from senatorial advice. But circumstances have changed, and the seriousness of the moment requires all of us to speak out in order to preserve our nation’s commitment to the rule of law.”

Soon after, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) echoed the call, as did Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).

As Politico reported, “The Illinois Democrat is the highest ranking member of Senate Democratic leadership to endorse impeachment proceedings. Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the No. 3 and No. 4 Senate Democrats, previously said they supported an impeachment inquiry.”

At a certain level, I can appreciate why the opinions of Senate Democrats may be of limited relevance. They are, after all, in the minority, and won’t have a say as to whether or not the House acts.

But I think it matters when so many Senate Dems endorse impeachment because it sends an unmistakable signal that a party consensus is taking shape.

I don’t doubt that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) remains skeptical of the process, just as I’m sure she believes it’s in her party’s interests to choose a different course. But as powerful as Pelosi is, Congress’ top Democrat will find it incredibly difficult to push back against the consensus view of her party.

For months, I considered Trump’s impeachment unlikely. Suddenly, it seems inevitable."

World stocks dropped on Wednesday after Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. Traders also recoiled after Trump criticized China's economic policies and warned of the ""immense power"" of social media platforms at the United Nations on Tuesday.

The Democratic Speaker of the House pulled the trigger in response to the US president reportedly withholding aid to Ukraine while pressuring its leader to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.

""The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution,"" Pelosi said. ""The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.""

The White House has agreed to release the transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and plans to turn over the whistleblower complaint that followed the call and sparked the impeachment effort to Congress by Thursday, according to CNBC.

""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. ""No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!""

A few hours later, he tweeted the impeachment inquiry amounted to ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT.""

Traders won't be thrilled by the prospect of several weeks of impeachment hearings and endless media speculation.

""Markets won't like the uncertainty it brings. In previous instances (Nixon, Clinton) there has been rockiness for equities and the dollar,"" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said in a morning note.

Wilson warned the inquiry has a ""very low chance of success"" given the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to support impeachment, and said it was ""probably a storm in a tea cup.""

Trump's UN speech didn't ease anxieties

Trump's speech at the UN on Tuesday tempered traders' hopes for high-level talks between the US and China next month to resolve the trade war.

""Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,"" he said at the UN General Assembly, according to Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, Chinese officials called for the Trump administration, which has slapped tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods and blacklisted Chinese companies such as Huawei, to ease off.

""China-US relations today have once again come to a crossroads,"" Wang Yi, China's Foreign Minister, said in New York on Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post. ""While China opens wider to the US and the rest of the world, we expect the US to do the same to China and remove all unreasonable restrictions.""

""The political turmoil around Donald Trump's official impeachment inquiry, combined with rising fears of no agreement with China in October trade talks, turned the risk sentiment off across the global markets,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group.

Trump also took aim at US tech companies, flagging their ""immense power"" and warning ""a free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people,"" according to Bloomberg. His comments helped to wipe a combined $56 billion from the market capitalizations of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet-parent Google — the so-called FAANG stocks.

* In Nevada, a new Suffolk University/Reno Gazette Journal poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers shows Joe Biden leading, but his margin over Elizabeth Warren is shrinking. The former vice president has 24% support, followed by Warren at 19%, and Bernie Sanders at 14%. Every other Democratic presidential hopeful was below 5% in this poll.

* Speaking of Sanders, the Vermont senator unveiled a new wealth tax today, including a steep tax specifically targeting billionaires. The longtime independent added that he hopes “the day comes when” billionaires no longer exist.

* According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, a combined 69% of voters say they don’t like Donald Trump personally, “regardless of their feelings about his policy agenda.” Before Trump, the worst any modern president has fared on this question was George W. Bush in March 2006, right after Hurricane Katrina, when 42% of voters said they didn’t like the president personally, regardless of his policies.

* The Democratic National Committee announced new qualifying thresholds for the party’s November presidential primary debate: participants will need to reach 3% support in four polls and 165,000 unique donors. There is, however, a notable twist: the DNC also said that candidates can reach the polling threshold by reaching 5% support in two approved polls from the early nominating states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and/or South Carolina).

* With virtual caucuses ruled out as a result of cybersecurity concerns, Iowa Democrats are moving forward with a series of “satellite” caucuses that will be held on February 3, though not necessarily at the same time.

* A year after 67% of voters ages 18 to 22 voted Democratic, the Republican National Committee is launching a voter-registration campaign intended to mobilize Donald Trump’s on-campus supporters. According to the Associated Press, the effort is called the “Make Campus Great Again” initiative."

Here's the market roundup as of 10:22 a.m. in New York:"
283,Steve Benen,"Rudy Giuliani, in his capacity as one of Donald Trump’s personal lawyers, has an amazing habit of saying the darnedest things.

The former New York City mayor has already admitted pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in order to help his client in the Oval Office – something Giuliani considers entirely proper. Last night, he told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that State Department asked him to pursue such efforts.

HANNITY: You didn’t get involved in this on your own. Did our State Department ask you to go on a mission for them? GIULIANI: They did. I was called by the State – HANNITY: And you’re a good citizen and you went? GIULIANI: The State Department called me and said, would I take a call from Mr. Yermak, who’s number two or three to the president-elect, now the president. I was put together with Mr. Earmach. I talked to him he gave me enormously important facts. I conveyed them all to the State Department – unlike the media lies, fake news, I wasn’t operating on my own. I was operating at the request of the State Department.

This roughly dovetails with a Wall Street Journal report from the weekend, which said that Giuliani, according to his own account, met with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to the Ukrainian president, as part of a meeting that had been “set up by the State Department.”

As a rule, taking Giuliani’s rhetoric at face value makes about as much sense as taking Donald Trump’s rhetoric at face value. It’s entirely possible, if not likely, that the former mayor will walk all of this back, perhaps even claiming he didn’t say what a national audience heard him say.

But in case this isn’t obvious, if the U.S. State Department was directly involved in dispatching the president’s private lawyer to Ukraine, as part of a political scheme intended to help Trump’s re-election campaign, it will make the already damaging story quite a bit worse.

Speaking of Giuliani, the Republican lawyer told CNN last week, in reference to his efforts in Ukraine, “I did what I did on my own, and then I told [Trump] about it afterwards. Because I’m his lawyer.”

Over the weekend, however, the Washington Post asked Giuliani whether Trump had given the lawyer’s efforts his presidential blessing. Giuliani replied, “I don’t do anything that involves my client without speaking with my client.”

Those two answers don’t seem to line up perfectly.

Update: On Face the Nation over the weekend, CBS News’ Margaret Brennan asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not only whether he considered Giuliani’s efforts “appropriate,” but also, “Has the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine been providing support, the State Department been supporting what he’s doing?”

Pompeo replied that he’s “not going to talk about that.”"

His response: falsely accuse Biden of corruption.",2019-09-24,MSNBC,"When Trump confronts with scandal, projection remains his go-to move",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-trump-confronts-scandal-projection-remains-his-go-move,"Just over the last month or so, the corruption allegations against Donald Trump have piled up quickly. It seems like ages ago, but it was just last month when the president announced an effort to have the next G-7 summit held at one of his Florida properties, creating a dynamic in which several key world leaders would have no choice but to effectively put money in his pocket by way of one of his struggling businesses.

Soon after, Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Ireland for meetings in Dublin, but at the president’s “suggestion,” he stayed three hours away at a Trump-owned property on the other side of the country. This, of course, was followed by reports about military personnel staying at Trump’s business in Scotland, while supporting a nearby airport on which the president’s business heavily relies.

And then, of course, the public learned about Trump’s alleged efforts to get Ukraine to help his re-election campaign by digging up dirt on one of his Democratic rivals – a story the president appears to have lied about, changed his story about, and taken steps to cover up.

It was against this backdrop that the Republican spoke to reporters yesterday, sitting alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda. Trump turned to a familiar tactic:

“[T]here was no pressure put on [Ukrainian officials] whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it would probably, possibly, have been okay if I did. But I didn’t. I didn’t put any pressure on them whatsoever. You know why? Because they want to do the right thing. And they know about corruption. And they probably know that Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. They probably know that. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right? But the fake news doesn’t want to report it because they’re Democrats.”

In reality, there’s simply no evidence of the former vice president engaging in any corruption. Republicans are playing a little game, and expecting everyone to play along, but they’re pushing an unsubstantiated claim.

But when push comes to shove, the president can’t shake what I like to think of as his “no-puppeting” problem. Confronting allegations of corruption, Trump reflexively accuses his critics of corruption. The Republican has a playbook for defending himself, and projection is the first page.

A couple of months ago, for example, Trump faced condemnations after using racist rhetoric against four Democratic congresswomen of color. The president responded by accusing the congresswomen of being racists.

A couple of months before that, following a series of bizarre incidents, Trump was accused of mental decline. He responded by accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of being in mental decline.

Circling back to our earlier coverage, it’s a tactic that’s come to define his entire approach to politics: like an intemperate child, Trump’s I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I instincts are finely tuned after extensive practice.

When Democrats accused the president a variety of crimes, Trump insisted the “real crimes were committed” by Democrats. When Dems argued the president obstructed justice, Trump replied that it’s the Dems who have obstructed justice.

Confronted with allegations that his political operation colluded with Russian attackers, Trump said Democrats colluded with Russia. Told that the Kremlin supported his candidacy, Trump responded by saying Russia supported Democrats. Accused of being a manipulated pawn for Vladimir Putin, Trump accused Barack Obama of being Putin’s “patsy.”

And during the 2016 campaign: whenever Hillary Clinton would criticize Trump, it was a near certainty that Trump would then make the identical accusation against Clinton. After a while, as regular readers may recall, this got a little creepy.

Clinton accused Trump of being unstable and reckless, so Trump said Clinton is “unstable” and “reckless.” Clinton said Trump mistreated women, so Trump said Clinton mistreated women. Clinton accused Trump of bigotry, so Trump said Clinton’s a “bigot.” Clinton questioned Trump’s temperament, so Trump said Clinton had a bad “temperament.” Clinton said Trump makes a poor role model for children, so Trump said Clinton sets “a terrible example for my son and the children in this country.”

And, of course, Clinton accused Trump of being a “puppet” for his allies in Moscow during a 2016 debate. Trump, showing all of the sophistication of a slow toddler, responded, “No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet. No, you’re the puppet.”

With a track record like this one, is it really any wonder Trump is falsely accusing Biden of corruption?"

Overnight reporting from the Washington Post suggests his denial wasn’t true.

President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials. Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had “concerns” and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent. Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an “interagency process” but to give them no additional information – a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11.

Also last night, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, and the New York Times published similar reports, making clear that it was Trump who personally put a hold on U.S. aid to Ukraine ahead of his chat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

It doesn’t take much of an imagination to connect the dots here. The accusation has come into focus: Trump wanted Ukraine to intervene in the American election, but he needed leverage over his Ukrainian counterpart. The Republican took it upon himself to block the promised aid in the days leading up to a scheduled meeting with Zelensky, and then during the meeting, Trump leaned on the Ukrainian leader to participate in a partisan scheme intended to help keep him in power.

That administration officials received instructions to peddle a dubious cover story to Congress compounds the apparent offense. That Trump assured the public as recently as Sunday that he “didn’t delay anything” makes matters even worse.

If White House officials expect this to be a minor flap that blows over in a few days, they’re likely to be disappointed."

The Democratic presidential candidate, speaking in Delaware, stopped short of endorsing outright impeachment, but the statement signaled he is opening the door to those proceedings -- which many of his primary rivals have already demanded.

PELOSI TO ADDRESS GROUNDSWELL OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT CALLS INSIDE CAUCUS, AMID UKRAINE FUROR

“It is time for the Congress to formally investigate the conduct of this president,” Biden said Tuesday, saying that Trump “should stop stonewalling” House committee investigations into his alleged misconduct.

“If the president does not comply with requests from Congress … Donald Trump will leave Congress no choice, in my view, but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said.

“That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

Biden’s comments come after Trump vowed to release the transcript of a now-controversial phone call over the summer with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move came after it was confirmed that the White House froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.

The White House contended that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. Multiple administration sources told Fox News on Tuesday that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the money.

The aid to Ukraine also came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share, sources said.

Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.”

“There was no quid pro quo,” Trump said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.”

A day earlier, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions.

“No I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. … Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week, involving claims that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats nonetheless want to see the complaint.

Biden demanded that the administration make the complaint available to Congress, along with other documents and information that's been requested.

Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role, including that he apparently threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine.

As it happens, Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being overly soft on corruption. But Trump has claimed Shokin “was after” Hunter Biden, suggesting that Joe Biden was out to protect his son.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” on Monday.

“I can take the political attacks,” Biden countered Tuesday. “They’ll come and they’ll go, and in time they’ll soon be forgotten.”

“But,"" he added, ""if we allow a president to get away with shredding the U.S. Constitution, that will last forever. This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue and a security issue.”

On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.

There are now 164 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach Trump.

The research culminated in the #1 New York Times bestselling book “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends” (Harper Collins, March 2018). Below are some of the results of the investigation.

1. Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in April 2014, according to RSB bank records. Hunter Biden had little background in energy. Over a 16-month period, Burisma paid $3.1 million to a bank account associated with Hunter’s business.

2. Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s policy toward Ukraine when he served as vice president. Biden helped shape Ukraine’s energy and anti-corruption policies, issues that directly impact Burisma.

3. Burisma sought to capitalize Hunter Biden’s name and relationships. According to The New York Times, Hunter Biden helped assemble the company’s legal team, which consisted of American attorneys and consulting firms, including a former Obama Justice Department official.

4. Burisma is led by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky served as ecology minister under pro-Russia former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich, leading to allegations that he used his office to benefit Burisma.

5. Burisma was under legal scrutiny. Shortly before Hunter Biden was appointed to Burisma’s board, British authorities froze $23 million of Zlochevsky’s assets as part of a corruption investigation. Ukraine opened its own probe later that year.

6. Financial records from Morgan Stanley show numerous lines of money going into the account of “Robert H. Biden.” The funds originated from oligarchs and anonymous LLCs in Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan and elsewhere.

7. In 2013, then-Vice President Biden and his son Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days later, Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.

""Congress should demand the information it has the legal right to receive,"" Biden said Tuesday during a speech in Delaware. ""If the president does not comply with such a request of the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will, in my view, leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy of his own making.""

Trump, on Tuesday, announced that he would release the full transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is at the center of the latest controversy Democrats have cited in their push for impeachment.

The administration reportedly suppressed a whistleblower seeking to report on Trump and Zelensky's phone call, which reportedly involved the president repeatedly urging his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Trump has denied any quid pro quo for foreign aid, but Democrats have portrayed the call as a second attempt for Trump to welcome outside interference in a presidential election.

PELOSI EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

Biden called on Trump to release the full whistleblower report to Congress and comply with other congressional requests. The administration has stonewalled congressional investigations by refusing to comply with subpoenas surrounding the Russia investigation.

While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has repeatedly resisted calls for impeachment, the Ukraine controversy appeared to change her mind. Fox News has confirmed that the speaker planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry at 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

Trump has used the whistleblower controversy to refocus attention on accusations surrounding Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings. Biden allegedly tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was probing a firm tied to his son.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the call with Zelensky, insisting that he never engaged in any quid pro quo for foreign aid.

In March 2016, then-Vice President Biden told Ukraine’s then-President Petro Poroshenko that the Eastern European nation would not get a $1 billion U.S. government loan guarantee unless it fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma Holdings — a natural gas extraction company whose board of directors included Hunter Biden, the veep’s son.

Shokin told The Hill’s John Solomon that plans for his probe “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”

WH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY WATCHDOG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS,' OFFICIAL SAYS

Hunter Biden reportedly earned some $50,000 per month for his services, although he had no expertise in gas production and didn’t know Ukraine from Utah. He was experienced, however, in being the son of the vice president of the United States who, as luck would have it, “was serving as the Obama administration’s point man on relations with Ukraine and rooting out bureaucratic corruption,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

Joe Biden must have been aware of Hunter’s term on Burisma’s board. Indeed, major news organizations raised serious questions about this arrangement.

“Hunter Biden’s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power,” read a May 14, 2014, Washington Post headline. And a June 8, 2014 Fox News story was headlined: “Ukraine energy firm hiring Biden’s son raises ethical concerns”

Joe Biden discussed his March 2016 showdown with Poroshenko in remarks before the Council on Foreign Relations, of which I am a member, on January 23, 2018.

“I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee,” the former vice president explained about his mission to Kiev, per the CFR’s transcript. “And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.”

“I said, ‘I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,’” Biden continued. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.’ I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. (Laughter.) He got fired.”

Biden’s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice.

And President Trump is the bad guy?

Also, the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine’s current president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden’s behavior supposedly is based on the complaint of a mysterious whistleblower.

However, it now transpires that this supposed whistleblower is not an eyewitness or even an earwitness to the Trump-Zelensky conversation. So, rather than a whistleblower, or perhaps a dog whistle, this entire fandango — including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s just-announced impeachment inquiry — is fueled by merely an echo of a whistle. In other words, hearsay.

Conversely, Biden’s incriminating words were neither overheard nor just transcribed. In fact, he said this on camera at an on-the-record CFR meeting. Video tape exists of Biden boasting about securing the dismissal of the man who was probing his son’s possible graft.

So, apparently it’s a potentially impeachable offense for President Trump to raise Biden’s possible obstruction of justice in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which Kiev’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko called “long, friendly” and “no pressure.”

Meanwhile, it’s perfectly OK that the former vice president, as he personally crowed, blackmailed then-President Poroshenko into firing the top prosecutor who was investigating Hunter Biden’s possible graft.

In the piece, the recovering Hunter Biden acknowledged a longtime addiction to cocaine and alcohol. He also acknowledged frequenting prostitutes, and having other marital difficulties.

The New Yorker also detailed Hunter's two questionable business deals, including a $1.5 billion donation from a Chinese businessman to a private equity firm, BHR Partners, on whose board Hunter sat.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN

""Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House,"" The New Yorker said.

The president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, maintained in a fiery accusation on Fox News Sunday that the money was donated days after the younger Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force Two.

""When he comes back ... eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict,"" he said.

President Trump has faced a whirlwind of criticism following accusations that he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family dealings, using military aid as leverage. But the controversy has also renewed scrutiny on the Biden family's questionable business dealings.

A second private equity firm founded by Biden received $3.4 million from a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings. Burisma Holdings also paid Hunter up to $50,000 a month to sit on its board.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Giuliani said when Ukrainian prosecutors investigated Burisma Holdings for corruption, then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the government to fire its head prosecutor.

""When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor who Biden approved -- you don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy is going on -- the new prosecutor dropped the case,"" Giuliani said.

The Biden camp maintains Giuliani is wrong -- that Biden, as well as other Western leaders and the International Monetary Fund, wanted the prosecutor fired because he wasn't aggressive enough in investigating the pro-Russian head of Ukraine's natural resources ministry, Mykola Zlochevsky, who also secretly headed Burisma Holdings through shell companies. It was only after the Ukraine government changed hands in a popular anti-Russian uprising that Hunter Biden was appointed to the board.

There wasn't a hint ""of scandal at all when we were there and I impose the same strict rules,"" Joe Biden said last August.

Separately, Joe Biden's brother, James Biden, is also being sued for conspiracy to defraud a business partner.

""James Biden repeatedly would try to leverage his brother Joe Biden's connections ... connections to the court systems, connections to labor unions, connections to the Department of Veterans Affairs with the hopes that ... he could get my clients lucrative contracts. But none of these promises were fulfilled,"" the plaintiff’s attorney Robert Peal, told Fox News.

An attorney representing James Biden did not respond to Fox News' request for a response. Joe Biden and his family have denied any impropriety.

""I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with our businesses. Period,"" Joe Biden said in August.

The New Yorker reported in its June piece that Hunter Biden declined a second term on Burisma Holdings' board, and that his decision to serve on the board during a first term was a mistake.

""It certainly wasn’t worth the grief,” he said. ""I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.”"

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER - BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

On Wednesday, Trump released a transcript of a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in which the two discussed investigating Biden over corruption allegations.

Biden, who has been the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, attracted scrutiny for pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, served on the board of directors.

Republicans have used the opportunity to turn the tables on Biden, claiming that the Ukraine controversy highlighted how Biden abused his power while in office.

Warren also seemed to benefit from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to impeach Trump, something Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday despite previous calls from Warren and others.

Pelosi resisted calls for impeachment surrounding the Russia investigation but seemed to face a tipping point after news surfaced about Trump's call with Zelensky. The speaker decried Trump's conduct while also accusing his administration of breaking the law by trying to suppress a whistleblower report on the president's comments.

Warren, on Saturday, was just one of many to pressure Pelosi after the initial news surfaced and before the speaker announced impeachment proceedings.

He said the change showed growing support among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party for the president to be investigated.

Earlier this week, Trump called the Biden father and son ""corrupt"" and slammed media ""double standards"" over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden related to dealings with Kiev.

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”"

The call in question raises questions about whether or not Trump attempted to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family for possible corruption in exchange for U.S. aid and has been the catalyst for an official impeachment inquiry against Trump, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday.

""The 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it,"" Biden said in a statement.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT ACCURACY, AS DEMS THROW SHADE

During the July 25 phone call between the two presidents, Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.”

Trump's reference to Biden and his son relates to the former vice president's insistence that Ukraine fired its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

“Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me,” Trump said, according to the declassified transcript.

The 2020 Democratic presidential contender vowed that he would ""continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families.""

Biden also urged Congress to forge ahead with impeachment proceedings, saying ""Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable.""

Biden called the transcript, which isn't a verbate of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky but rather a summary of “notes and recollections"" from the conversation an ""abridged version that the White House was willing to issue to the public.""

""Congress is entitled to the full whistleblower complaint, and any and all other information about this matter,"" he added.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. who is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, set a Thursday deadline for the White House and State Department to turn over the related whistleblower complaint and other information related to the phone call but warned that the committee would issue a subpoena if the request wasn't fulfilled.

""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!""

Trump added: ""The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!""

Department of Justice lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News.

The dramatic ""flip-the-script"" moment could blunt Democrats' newly energized push to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, based on a whistleblower's allegation that the president pressed the new Ukrainian leader during the phone call to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter.

But Democrats were sure to continue their push for the whistleblower's full complaint and testimony, which could provide additional details. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent.

""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week.""

It was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president.

And Yahoo News reported that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had written to the whistleblower's attorney, requesting a bipartisan closed-door interview.

At the same time, the matter threatened to shine a harsh spotlight on the Bidens' activities in Ukraine, and top Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., warned the situation could ""backfire"" on Democrats.

""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

Top Trump surrogates, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have long said that Ukraine should investigate that matter fully.

And Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense. An administration official told the Wall Street Journal that Trump's actions on the call with Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing.""

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a ""disgrace,"" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

Still, there were other indications that releasing the transcript would not fully satisfy the growing chorus of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry. In a statement on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., strongly suggested that impeachment might be on the table if the whistleblower's full complaint was not provided to Congress.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said.

She was expected to get behind an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.

Several commentators also cast skepticism on Trump's announcement within minutes.

""Nixon released his own transcripts of the Oval Office tapes — which turned out to be wildly misleading,"" said historian Kevin Cruse.

Added Politico correspondent Natasha Bertrand: ""Full transcript ≠ full whistleblower complaint.""

Meanwhile, a slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that the president personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before his phone call with the Ukrainian president.

The aggressive move signaled that the White House would seek to turn the tables against Democrats who have initiated an impeachment inquiry, following the whistleblower's complaint that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden. Zelensky, speaking across from Trump just an hour earlier, told reporters he did not feel ""pushed"" at all in his conversations with the president.

WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED

Earlier in the day, the White House released a transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country. But the transcript also did not demonstrate that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in The Washington Post had claimed.

At the press conference, Trump specifically called attention to a little-discussed CNN report from May, which described how Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy pushed Ukraine’s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and, by Democrats' current logic, seemingly implied that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake.

""The Democrats have done what they're accusing me of doing,"" Trump said.

The Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Ukraine's leader at the time: ""In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building [democratic] institutions despite ongoing military, economic, and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump.""

The senators called for the top prosecutor to “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

The Post's Marc Thiessen initially flagged the letter on Tuesday, calling it evidence of a ""double standard"" among Democrats.

""Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the president of Ukraine that if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress,"" Trump added.

That was a reference to the Connecticut Democrat's comments at a bipartisan meeting in Kiev earlier this month, when Murphy called U.S. aid the “most important asset” of Ukraine -- then issued a warning.

""I told Zelensky that he should not insert himself or his government into American politics,"" Murphy said, according to The Hill. ""I cautioned him that complying with the demands of the President's campaign representatives to investigate a political rival of the President would gravely damage the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. There are few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in Washington these days, and support for Ukraine is one of them.""

READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRUMP PHONE CALL

Responding to Trump's statements, Murphy said that ""in the meeting Republican Senator Ron Johnson and I had with President Zelensky three weeks ago, I made it clear to him that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election and that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign. I still believe this to be true.""

But in colorful language, Trump told reporters that the evidence clearly showed Democrats were disingenuously attacking him for political gain.

""We have the greatest economy we've ever had,"" The president said. ""When you see little [House Intelligence Committee Chair] Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic, smart guy by the way. ... Then he goes into a room with [House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry] Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off.""

""They must laugh their asses off."" — President Trump, referring to Democrats Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff

Not all Democrats in the House have been on board with impeachment. 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Wednesday that the Ukraine transcript did not present a ""compelling"" reason to impeach the president.

Taking the fight to the Democrats over the scores of Democrats who do support an impeachment inquiry could pay dividends for Republicans ahead of next year's elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Wednesday that its fundraising was up 608 percent after Democrats' impeachment push.

And the Trump reelection campaign and GOP announced they had raised a combined $5 million in just 24 hours.

Trump, accompanied by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, also slammed the media for focusing so heavily on a whistleblower's allegation that he improperly pressured Zelensky for political reasons.

WATCH: PELOSI ADMITS SHE HASN'T READ THE UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT

""We've made some fantastic deals, like with Japan, for farmers -- and that doesn't get covered, because you waste your time on nonsense,"" Trump said. ""It's very sad what Democrats are doing to this country -- they're dividing, they're demeaning.""

Pompeo and Mnuchin each discussed progress on trade, including the ongoing trade war with China, as well as Iran policy.

Trump's comments came shortly after he wrapped up a joint media appearance with Zelensky -- who flatly told reporters that he did not feel ""pushed"" to investigate Joe Biden.

“We had a great phone call,” Zelensky said earlier, as he sat across from Trump. “It was normal.”

Zelensky's comments did little to quiet a growing call among Democrats to press ahead with the impeachment inquiry announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Also on Wednesday, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire flatly contradicted another report in the Post, and maintained he never considered resigning over the matter.

""The Amazon Washington Post put out a fake article that [Maguire] was going to quit, blaming the White House for something they wouldn't let him talk openly about -- and I was shocked,"" Trump said at the presser.

The transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. The document begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before asking for a “favor” in the form of Ukraine providing information about the hacking of a Democratic National Committee (DNC) server in 2016 as part of apparent election interference efforts.

UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS NO EXPLICIT QUID PRO QUO

Trump referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Separately, the transcript shows, the president then pushed for a closer look at Biden's own dealings in Ukraine.

Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

Meanwhile, political scientist Ian Bremmer said the real scandal wasn't Biden's pressure to get rid of Shokin, but Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine.

Hunter Biden took a key position at Burisma shortly after Joe Biden visited Ukraine in 2014 and pushed officials there to greatly increase natural gas production. Hunter made tens of thousands of dollars a month but had no relevant credentials.

""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" Bremmer wrote.

""That’s a problem for the Vice President, but completely unrelated to Biden urging Ukraine President to fire his Special Prosecutor,"" Bremmer continued. ""[The prosecutor] was corrupt, refused to investigate anyone, and who Dems and GOP agreed needed to go.""

Trump said in the phone call with the Zelensky that he was focused primarily on the circumstances surrounding Shokin's termination.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call with the Zelensky. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

BIDEN UKRAINE DEALINGS: 7 ESSENTIAL FACTS

At the presser, Trump broadened the scope of his concerns to the Biden's business dealings generally, and said that he was reluctant to release the transcript because he was concerned about setting the ""precedent"" of releasing private calls with foreign leaders to ""the fake news media.""

""But you folks were saying such lies about a call that was so innocent and so nice,"" Trump said, that he felt compelled to act.

On Wednesday, just prior to his press conference, Trump tweeted that he had told Republicans he supported a closer look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine.

""I have informed @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy and all Republicans in the House that I fully support transparency on so-called whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter, on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China,"" Trump wrote.

""Additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat,"" he added.

Bipartisan efforts are underway for the whistleblower to testify before Congress.

The Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News –pushed back Wednesday on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress.

The letter also said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call.

Sources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation.

Newsmax CEO and Trump confidant Chris Ruddy expressed his skepticism on Tuesday night about the hype surrounding the allegations being made about Trump and his communications with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""You thought that the Mueller thing should be investigated, the collusion thing- that took two years, $50 million,"" Ruddy told ""CNN Tonight"" anchor Don Lemon. ""I could tell you 12 headlines from CNN and other media that never came out to be true. And at the end of the day, there was no collusion.""

""It never said, 'no collusion,'"" Lemon asserted.

""It was very definitive, but my point is we are now three days into this and we already have an impeachment process underway,"" Ruddy continued. ""If the president committed a crime, I believe he should be impeached, but there's no evidence here yet that he committed any crime and I don't believe he did.""

The Trump ally repeatedly pressed Lemon on what crimes Trump allegedly violated, something the CNN anchor couldn't answer.

""Even if he was saying, 'I want an investigation of what happened in the 2016 election where they were clearly interfering, the Ukrainians, in that American election... and an investigation of Joe Biden was also a role, what is illegal about that?"" Ruddy asked. ""It may be totally inappropriate... so you're now on the basis of hearsay or a discussion on this we're already under an impeachment process... what federal law has he violated?""

Ruddy later pivoted to knock CNN's coverage of the Ukraine scandal.

""The Democrats in Washington are talking about impeaching [Trump] on basically hearsay... for the very thing Joe Biden did- he was trying to push out a prosecutor. You don't show that clip anytime,"" Ruddy told Lemon in reference to the 2018 video of Biden bragging about his involvement in pushing out a Ukrainian prosecutor by threatening to withhold foreign aid.""

""We're not here to talk about Joe Biden,"" Lemon responded, ""because none of that has been-""

""You don't want to talk about anything that's a counternarrative,"" Ruddy shot back.

The Newsmax CEO went on to suggest that the impeachment movement is occurring because people were ""unhappy"" with the results of the 2016 election, something Lemon rejected by saying ""that is a feeling, not a fact.""

""Even though the polling is showing that not the majority of the American people are not necessarily on the side of impeachment, you don't think that it is a good thing that lawmakers are doing what is right rather than doing what the polls are showing?"" Lemon asked. ""Because a lot of people who want this impeachment inquiry to happen are in Trump districts and may not get the votes that they want next time.""

""I think there's been a constant drumbeat like your coverage- CNN, not you personally,"" Ruddy responded. ""All night long, I didn't see really anyone that was supportive of the president's position. I may be the first person on all night.""

""No, there have been other people. You didn't see them,"" Lemon reacted.

""They're very rare and they're exceptions to the narrative,"" Ruddy continued. ""I think the American people are seeing it. They're ultimately going to be the judge of the impeachment process."""

""This is a White House that has falsified information before -- from showing a doctored hurricane map to promoting a video that an outside group altered of a CNN reporter. So who knows if this transcript will actually be complete?"" Tapper asked. He also noted that complaints surrounding Trump involved more than just the phone call.

Tapper's comments came just before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced a formal impeachment inquiry. Pelosi said ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.

""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law.""

Trump, on Tuesday, denied any wrongdoing and offered to release the transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

He also blasted Pelosi's decision to pursue impeachment since she ""never even saw the transcript.""

Trump has denied pressuring Zelensky, something Ukraine's foreign minister seemed to corroborate on Saturday. The president also disputed speculation that he tried to extort an investigation out of Ukraine by withholding foreign aid.

The video surfaced after Biden appeared to offer support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision, announced on Tuesday, to open a formal impeachment inquiry on President Trump.

NANCY PELOSI ON BILL CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT IN 1998: 'REPUBLICANS ARE PARALYZED WITH HATRED'

""Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,"" he said in a statement released by his campaign. Biden's statement specifically called out the administration for suppressing the whistleblower report cited by Pelosi, D-Calif., in Tuesday's announcement.

According to Pelosi, the administration violated U.S. law when the Director of National Intelligence blocked an unnamed whistleblower from speaking out on Trump's comments to Ukrainian leadership. The administration has denied any wrongdoing and claimed whistleblower statutes didn't apply to that particular report.

The specter of impeachment has naturally conjured media comparisons to Clinton's administration-- the last time the House of Representatives impeached a sitting president. The House famously impeached Clinton, accusing him of committing perjury, among other things, when he lied under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky,

Biden, at the time, defended the president, suggesting that an impeachment inquiry might subvert the will of the American people.

“This is their president we are talking about,"" Biden said. ""The President of the United States does not serve at the pleasure of the legislature, does not serve at the pleasure of Joe Biden, does not serve at the pleasure of Henry Hyde, does not serve at the pleasure of the Congress, as a prime minister does in a parliamentary system.""

""He is elected directly by the people of the United States of America, and the election of a president is the only nationwide vote the American people will ever cast and that’s a big deal.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT ACCURACY, AS DEMS THROW SHADE

The issue could become even more complicated for Biden, now the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, as the Ukraine controversy centered on Trump seeking an investigation into corruption allegations surrounding the former vice president.

Republicans and the president have responded to Democratic attacks by framing impeachment as another attack in their relentless war to remove Trump from office. Their rhetoric bore a resemblance to Biden's in that the party has accused Democratic leadership of trying to undermine the 2016 election results.

""There's been a double standard from Democrats since day one with this president,' said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. ""They have refused to accept the results of the election, boycotting the inauguration, the 2-year Russia hoax where the president was clearly exonerated, no collusion, no obstruction. And now this, where they rush to judgment in a knee-jerk way to bring impeachment proceedings when they haven't even read the transcript or heard from the inspector general.""

Pelosi, in 1998, also described Republicans as ""paralyzed with hatred"" as they pursued impeachment against Clinton.

“Today the Republican majority is not judging the president with fairness, but impeaching him with a vengeance,"" then-House Minority Leader Pelosi declared on the House floor in December 1998.

Giuliani also commented on House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump and said their efforts are a sideshow. He called on Biden to release all records from his time in the executive branch.

Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats for allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and using military aid as leverage. The president has denied any wrongdoing.

“The president must be held accountable,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday, citing Trump's alleged “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”

“So that to which the president has admitted is in and of itself a crime,” Smith followed. Napolitano responded, ""yes,"" and claimed it was the same crime former Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigated as part of the long-running Russia investigation.

Napolitano's comments came amid renewed calls for impeachment and just before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the formalization of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Tuesday. Pelosi said ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The move toward impeachment proceedings gained momentum after a whistleblower's allegation that the president pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. He has also denied any wrongdoing, and Shokin was widely criticized for allegedly being too soft on corruption.

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a ""disgrace,"" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

On ""Shephard Smith Reporting,"" Napolitano indicated that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, could have committed a crime if he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden in a bid to help the president's reelection efforts.

Giuliani previously said that he directed Ukraine to investigate Biden but not as part of an effort to help Trump win reelection.

FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID

Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.

But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming administration of Volodymyr Zelensky was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding.

The aid to Ukraine also, according to sources, came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share.

Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.”

“There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.”

The White House’s decision to release the funding ultimately was made in mid-August, after Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, called the president and said that Ukraine desperately needed the aid, according to administration sources.

The White House, at the time, was also up against an appropriation “impoundment” deadline, which meant the money would either have to be spent, or impounded. The White House would have been forced to go to court to justify the impoundment, which sources said it did not want to do.

The White House, though, has denied the allegations that the freezing of the Ukrainian aid was tied to allegations that the president asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.

“The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this President.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations Monday, Trump also denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions.

“No, I didn’t—I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption…Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

But Democrats are concerned the president may have essentially withheld money to Ukraine as leverage to seek an investigation concerning the Bidens -- which is now prompting renewed impeachment calls.

The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role.

Nevertheless, Democrats have used the reports and new allegations against the president to press forward—even as it risks backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by Biden.

Late Monday night, a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.

The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.""

“These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.”

Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment.

There are now 154 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.)

Hunter Biden had been investigated related to his ties to a Ukrainian energy company.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

Biden said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Levin scoffed at the media's reporting about a whistleblower who reported President Trump had exerted pressure on the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, possibly holding up a military package for Ukraine, as well.

He said he's ""sick and tired"" of the president's conversations with foreign leaders being leaked to the media and to Democrats.

""I don't remember a damn one of those happening to Obama or any other president. Our president has to be able to speak to other heads of state without this kind of tyranny taking place!"" he said.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

“It is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux,” Murray noted."

""Look at the way Trump did it... when he wasn't on top of the polls he would show up with a couple tweets -- I remember he showed up in Las Vegas with like 25,000 people showing up and you don't see that organically on the Democratic side.

JIMMY CARTER SAYS HE HOPES 'THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT FOR PRESIDENCY' IN APPARENT JAB AT BIDEN, SANDERS

Biden’s been largely brushing off criticism that he’s too old for the Oval Office. Earlier this month, he told reporters he’ll prove his fitness through the grinding process that is the presidential campaign trail, and pledged to release his medical records when he gets his ""next physical” before the voting begins next February in the Iowa caucuses.

Former President Jimmy Carter, 95, also weighed in on the issue, saying he couldn't have handled the presidency at 80 years old during his term as the 39th U.S. president from 1977 until 1981, when he was in his 50s.

BRIT HUME CALLS BIDEN'S CONDITION 'WORRISOME'

Speaking during his annual report at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga., last week, Carter said he hopes ""there's an age limit"" to serving in one of the most powerful positions in the world.

“If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,"" he told the crowd.

We saw this throughout the Russia investigation, when the president countered the allegations of obstruction with a crusade against a witch hunt, Deep State conspiracy and fake news.

Trump is doing it again with the media and political furor over his phone call with Ukraine’s leader, trying to shift the spotlight to questionable conduct by Joe Biden and his son. And early indications are that it’s working.

BOLTON, NEOCONS HIT TRUMP FOR NOT STRIKING IRAN

Philippe Reines, the former State Department official and longtime Hillary Clinton confidant, said on “Media Buzz” that after the first round of political combat over Ukraine, Trump is the winner.

Whether that’s true or not, calling out Biden is very much the focus of the president’s counterattack against allegations that have reignited Democratic talk of impeachment.

Rudy Giuliani told me on Sunday that the political crisis is helping him accomplish what he’s been trying to do for five months, which is focus media scrutiny on the former vice president and Hunter Biden, who was paid big bucks by a Ukrainian gas giant that had come under investigation. Joe Biden has publicly bragged about pressuring Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor, who was overseeing the case—though it was not active at the time--by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees.

Giuliani pushed the Biden story on my show last April, and many other programs as well. He has also met with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to revive the Biden probe there. (No investigation has found wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.)

The president’s personal lawyer laid it out yesterday with Maria Bartiromo: “It’s the only way you can get this out. The only way they would cover this story is by punching the president in the face and then the president deflects the punch which he’s done, the story came down and then he hits with a right hand that’s more powerful.”

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

And that, in turn, is producing stories like this one the other day in the Washington Post:

“Suddenly, Biden faced two dueling realities: The president he is hoping to defeat next year — and who he describes as morally unfit for office — is under scrutiny for behavior some view as treasonous. But the story is inextricably linked to Biden’s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.”

The fact is it’s impossible to cover the furor over the Trump call without delving into the details of what at the least is Biden’s son trading on his name (as political relatives have done in every administration).

Trump bristled at Ukraine questions yesterday at the U.N., telling reporters they are ""a fake news group of people...If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the eletric chair right now."" At a time when longshot GOP rival Bill Weld is accusing him of treason, the president did not explain why Biden's actions would result in a death penalty case.

Those comments followed Trump telling reporters on Sunday that what the Wall Street Journal and others had reported about the July call was essentially true, though he insists it was totally appropriate:

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine. And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

So Trump is being accused of the same thing he’s saying Biden did in 2015, pressuring Ukraine for partisan reasons. The administration has been holding up $250 in military aid to help Ukraine fight Russian separatists. Trump says he never brought up the aid, but he didn’t have to—it’s hanging in the air.

The president said he’d “love” to release a transcript of the call with Volodymyr Zelensky, but has to figure out how to do so.

By the way, Trump was wrong when he recently tweeted that the media “want to stay as far away as possible” from the Biden allegations.

A quick search found many major stories on the matter, including:

New York Times, 2015: “Joe Biden, His Son and the Case Against a Ukrainian Oligarch”

Washington Post, 2019: “As Vice President, Biden Said Ukraine Should Increase Gas Production. Then His Son Got a Job with a Ukrainian Gas Company.”

New Yorker, 2019: “Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father’s Campaign?”

Joe Biden, for his part, angrily accused Trump over the weekend of abusing his power in an attempt to “smear” him because he knows “I’ll beat him like a drum.” Biden said he never discussed overseas business dealings with his son, which prompted Trump to call him a liar. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker they briefly discussed it once.

The more the story devolves into a partisan back-and-forth, the more it neutralizes the political danger to the president. That was the playbook against Bob Mueller.

Nancy Pelosi is under growing pressure from some previously impeachment-wary Democrats to drop her opposition in light of Ukraine. She is holding the line for now while warning the White House that failure to turn over key documents could prove the tipping point.

But Trump can easily survive—again—if he turns this into another two-sided scandal, filled with interminable details and unpronounceable names, that most Americans can’t follow."

TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday the formalization of an impeachment inquiry and specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the president is accused of pressing the foreign leader to ratchet up an inquiry into presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Rove not only argued that impeachment would put Biden's Ukraine roll into question but also bring other issues to the surface,

""Remember it's not only Hunter Biden who gets hired, Devon Archer, a longtime family friend of then-Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts also gets put on the board of Burisma,"" Rove said.

BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”

Booker refused to address the question directly and said Trump's actions were more severe.

""It's like saying, here's a firecracker over here. Pay no attention to the nuclear bomb going off,"" Booker replied. ""A president of the United States of America, in order to pursue his own personal benefit, withholds aid from an ally under attack.""

""The president of the United States should withhold bipartisan-approved aid that is life or death? I've been to the... region. I've seen the violence,"" he said, claiming there is ""no evidence whatsoever"" of wrongdoing by Biden after the issue was investigated.

Booker also said Congress is only using the threat of impeachment of President Trump as ""leverage"" to force the White House to release the transcript of Trump's call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky after it was alleged he pressured him to investigate Biden by withholding federal funding.

""We need the leverage, through an impeachment inquiry, to be able to better get to the truth,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""When they started with [Richard] Nixon they didn't know the truth yet. The public was mostly on the side of Nixon until the truth started coming out."""

Critics have been relentless in their condemnation of President Trump over a whistleblower's complaint about the context of a phone call between the president and newly elected Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky -- while ignoring allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Pence told Sean Hannity.

""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" he claimed.

Trump's conversation with Zelensky came as the Trump administration was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and denied delaying any military aid funding.

SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE 'FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE' OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT

Last week, a whistleblower complaint surfaced containing allegations Trump made a troubling and unspecified ""promise"" to a foreign leader later reported to be Zelensky -- touching off a Washington firestorm. On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation.

The whistleblower's allegation could, however, prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor wasn't fired.

To that extent, Pence told Hannity all Americans should know the full account of both Bidens' relations with Kiev.

""The American people have a right to know what happened. They have a right to know what happened in 2016 and they have a right to know what the circumstances were around having a sitting vice president threaten to withhold American aid.""

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END -- THANKS TO CLINTON-LINKED UKRAINE BOMBSHELL, NUNES SAYS

""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

Pence's comments to Hannity echoed remarks made by Trump during United Nations meetings in New York City.

""Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,"" Trump said Monday. ""If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.""

Trump added: ""Look at the double standards, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves…You got a lot of crooked journalists, you’re crooked as hell.""

“Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.

The comments come after the White House released a transcript reflecting that call. It showed Trump sought a probe into Biden family dealings in the country, though it did not show Trump explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid, as some have suggested.

“We had a great phone call,” Zelensky added. “It was normal.”

Trump interjected afterward: “In other words, there was no pressure and you know there was no pressure.”

Trump’s meeting with Zelensky comes just hours after the White House released the transcript of their summertime call and less than a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she was opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the issue.

“She’s lost her way, she’s been taken over by the radical left,” Trump said of Pelosi.

The speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree had already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act.

Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

But Democrats also slammed the president for seeking the Biden-related probe in Ukraine in the first place.

“This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Wednesday.

Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- millions of dollars of which had been frozen days earlier.

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyberfirm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

The White House and Trump allies have adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.”

But Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo.

Schiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always ""reciprocal,"" a comment he made after noting how ""very very good"" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making his requests regarding Biden.

“There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff said.

But if we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are others who have some explaining to do.

It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as ""strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,"" the Democratic senators declared, ""We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,"" before demanding Lutsenko ""reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.""

So, it's okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it's not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.

According to The New York Times, ""Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden ... who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general."" The Post reported it is ""unclear how seriously Shokin — who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall — was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out.""

What is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: ""I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a b----. He got fired.""

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

This weekend, Biden told reporters, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.'"" Moreover, the New Yorker reported, ""In December 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration's special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden.""

So, Biden was fully aware of his son's involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor's dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, ""It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president."" Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden's conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.

Put aside the prosecutor's firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.

And the focus will not just be on Ukraine. It will also be on how, as The Post reported, ""for more than two decades, [Hunter's] professional work often tracked with his father's life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China.""

While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats' investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Don’t get me wrong. It is not my purpose to minimize the politicization of American foreign relations. To the contrary, I just wrote a book, ""Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency."" In many ways, it is a ""cri de coeur"" for a restoration of a vital American norm. Incumbent administrations must not wield the awesome powers of the presidency, especially the powers to conduct foreign affairs and gather foreign intelligence, out of sheer partisanship.

My purpose is to place the potential wrong in context.

Let’s say, for argument’s sake, it is proven that Trump used his enormous influence over Kiev, or worse, his control over the release of defense aid Ukraine needs, strictly to better his electoral chances against Biden. That would be an abuse of power.

It would also make the 45th president, well, the 45th president in American history to exercise his powers under the influence of his political standing. That is particularly true of presidents seeking reelection, even if we suspect that most exploitations of foreign relations power for electoral advantage have been less crude than Trump’s alleged squeezing of Ukraine.

On that score, we must note that Trump denies exerting pressure and Ukraine denies that it felt pressured. Moreover, reports indicate that while the president urged his counterpart, repeatedly, to look into Biden’s alleged corruption, Trump did not explicitly tie that request to a release of $250 million in U.S. defense aid – although that aid, previously approved by Congress, was being slow-walked for reasons the administration has yet to explain.

Still, even if we assume that the president delayed the aid in order to spur Kiev regarding Biden, that hardly means Biden’s conduct and patent conflict-of-interest do not rate scrutiny.

In one of his notorious speak-first-think-later flourishes, Biden openly bragged that, as President Obama’s vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in financial aid Kiev desperately needed as a quid pro quo to extort Ukraine’s government into firing a prosecutor.

As the invaluable investigative journalist Peter Schweizer outlined in a Fox News column, this prosecutor was investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company that had put Biden’s son, Hunter, on its board under circumstances strongly suggesting it was currying favor with the then-vice president. Hunter Biden was lavishly compensated, notwithstanding that he had no discernible expertise in the energy sector.

Ukraine, moreover, is no one-off. Rudy Giuliani, the president’s private lawyer (who hired me as a prosecutor more years ago than either of us would care to remember), has pointed out that Hunter Biden accompanied Biden on Air Force Two for a trip to China about U.S. government business that apparently turned into an eye-popping $1.5 billion windfall for the then-vice president’s son. That is, Biden proved quite accommodating as the Obama administration’s point-man on relations with Beijing, and Beijing quickly made an astonishing injection of capital into an investment firm started by Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz (the stepson of then-Secretary of State John Kerry).

As Schweizer details in his important book, ""Secret Empires,"" the Communist Chinese government became a partner in the venture, as did a Massachusetts-based consultancy firm headed by James Bulger – son of the powerful former Massachusetts state senator Billy Bulger, and nephew and namesake of the notorious mobster Whitey Bulger.

That Trump may have been ham-handed in raising Biden allegations in the context of U.S.-Ukrainian relations does not mean Biden should get a pass. Indeed, if these activities involved a son of Donald Trump rather than Joe Biden, The New York Times and The Washington Post would already have assigned the usual five or 10 alpha-journalists apiece, and we’d already have been treated to the usual breathless hourly updates on CNN and MSNBC.

Obviously, a president can be in the wrong without being impeachable. Impeachment is a political remedy. It is a nonstarter in the absence of broad, bipartisan public support, which is plainly lacking in Trump’s case.

Political wrongs, if they are established, must be measured against the conduct of past presidents. Extensive investigations are underway of the Obama administration’s exploitation of foreign relations and foreign intelligence powers to influence the 2016 election – favoring Hillary Clinton and targeting Trump. Presumably, these investigations are inquiring into the relationship between the Obama administration and Ukraine. That relationship involved not only dropping an investigation of Hunter Biden’s company, but revving up an investigation of Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman. (At least, he was until media leaks sourced to Ukrainian officials resulted in his ouster.)

If Trump abused his powers, he was wrong to do so. It will make his reelection bid more difficult. But let’s not pretend he would the first to play this unsavory game.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

EXCLUSIVE: Official says watchdog found whistleblower had 'political bias' against Trump

""We know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family,” he tweeted. ""But $3 to $4m more was laundered to Biden. So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry’s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew.""

Giuliani was referring to Joe Biden’s son Hunter; Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry; and James Bulger, the nephew of notorious mobster Whitey Bulger.

The Washington Examiner reported this week that Hunter Biden's decision to join the board of the Ukrainian firm, Burisma Holdings, back in 2014, was enough to make Heinz, his business partner, raise questions with the State Department and later severed ties with the Biden.

The New Yorker recently ran an extensive article about Hunter Biden and mentioned several instances where he could have been perceived as using his father's position to help his career. In 2013, Hunter Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force 2 before he secured a $1.5 billion deal from a subsidiary of the Bank of China.

“You want to know why the secretary of state (Kerry) wasn't particularly upset about it? Because his son was getting money too. Isn't it a coincidence that China sends $1.5 billion to a private equity fund? There were only three owners: Biden’s son, Kerry's son, and Whitey Bulger’s nephew,” Giuliani told the Examiner.

Giuliani's tweets came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump focused partly on whether he abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government to undermine Joe Biden and help his own reelection.

In a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump is accused of asking for help investigating the Bidens. In the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine — prompting speculation that he was holding out the money as leverage for information on the Bidens. Trump has denied that charge, but acknowledged he blocked the funds, later released.

Biden said Tuesday, before Pelosi’s announcement, that if Trump doesn’t cooperate with lawmakers’ demands for documents and testimony in its investigations the president “will leave Congress ... with no choice but to initiate impeachment.”

He said he believed that Trump would not want a private conversation with a foreign leader being publicized as much as Presidents Clinton, Bush or Obama would have.

""None of them would,"" he said.

Earlier Monday, Trump tore into the press for their coverage of reports he pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden.

Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv.

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”

""We support the bipartisan, unanimous resolution passed by the Senate regarding our client's lawful whistleblower complaint and call upon the acting director of national intelligence to transmit our complete disclosure to the two Intelligence Oversight Committees,"" the statement read.

The Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday voted by unanimous consent for a resolution calling on the Trump administration to release to the Senate Intelligence Committee the whistleblower’s complaint. The Intelligence Committee has opened a bipartisan investigation into the complaint, and it was reported that the whistleblower may appear before the committee to give closed-door testimony.

The whisteblower’s legal counsel, Compass Rose Legal Group, confirmed in the statement that it wrote to the acting DNI for security guidance to permit the meeting if needed.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D.-Calif., responded to Compass Rose on Tuesday, requesting an interview with the whistleblower. ""In light of your notice of intent to the acting director of national intelligence, the committee requests a voluntary interview with your client on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019, in the afternoon, following the public testimony of acting Director Maguire before the committee. The committee is prepared to work with you to identify a secure location and format that preserves your client's privacy and ensure protection from reprisal or threat of reprisal,"" said Schiff.

Schiff also said the committee expects the acting DNI, in light of the legal counsel's letter to him, to cease withholding the complaint and provide the whistleblower with guidance as to how to communicate with his committee directly.

Maguire, as of Monday, was refusing to share details of the complaint with lawmakers. As a prelude to ratcheting up an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that unless Maguire provided information about the whistleblower complaint to Congress, administration officials would ""be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.”

In a letter last week, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote the agency is protecting the whistleblower and said the allegation is not an “urgent concern” and did not relate to ‘intelligence activity’ under the DNI’s supervision.

The whistleblower has alleged that President Trump ordered his staff to freeze $400 million in aid to Ukraine days before a July phone call with President Zelensky.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Tuesday announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump in the wake of the controversial call Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on the morning of July 25.

THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: HOW DOES REMOVING A PRESIDENT WORK?

The rough transcript of the call based on notes, released Wednesday morning, shows Trump pushing for Ukraine to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

That refers to Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where his son Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, given that Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

On Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky — a detail that fueled calls for impeachment proceedings. But the transcript does not include any mention of the aid, as a bargaining chip or otherwise.

“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,"" Trump said, according to the transcript.

Baier noted that House Democrats have not moved forward to a vote on impeachment, but many on the left will likely argue that a quid pro quo is ""implied"" by the president in the conversation.

""They will say that that conversation that preceded it is implied. Is that going to be the moment that gets a vote on an impeachment article? Obviously Nancy Pelosi doesn't think so yet. She hasn't moved to vote to authorize an inquiry,"" he said.

In the days before the call, Trump reportedly ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, a detail that fueled impeachment calls leading to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. Democrats have argued Trump may have been using the military aid as leverage to push Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings, though the White House has denied that.

I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”

The Post report, which cited ""current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter,"" said that Maguire had threatened to turn in his resignation over concerns that the White House might try to make him stonewall Congress.

Trump’s campaign on Wednesday sent out a fundraising email that slams House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other House Democrats for launching an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower’s complaint suggesting Trump sought the help of a foreign government in his bid for re-election.

“This is just another smear job and a pathetic attempt by Democrats to rip the power from the people,” the Trump campaign email stated. “I’VE DONE NOTHING WRONG. TRUST ME, YOU SAW THE TRANSCRIPT.”

READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO

The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing Trump broached a review of Biden family dealings in the country. The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually touches on the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

In the fundraising email, the Trump campaign calls the impeachment inquiry a “witch hunt” – a term frequently used by the president during the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election – and announces his campaign’s “Impeachment Defense Task Force.” The email does not go into details about what the task force will do or who will head it up.

“The Democrats’ constant personal attacks, vicious lies, and now these baseless impeachment attacks, have never had anything to do with me,” the email from the Trump campaign said. “This is only the beginning of yet ANOTHER nasty Witch Hunt against me, and we need to fight back BIGGER and STRONGER than ever before.”

The Trump campaign's manager, Brad Parscale, released a separate statement Wednesday saying, ""The facts prove the President did nothing wrong. This is just another hoax from Democrats and the media, contributing to the landslide re-election of President Trump in 2020.”

In her remarks Tuesday, Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.

""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law.""

Echoing Gaetz's remarks, host Sean Hannity said it was wrong for Democrats to ""lecture anybody else about the sanctimonious superiority of their values.""

On the call with the newly elected Ukrainian president, Trump allegedly pushed him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

But there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi's gambit could backfire, as Republicans predicted over the weekend.

“This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said.

The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, seeking an investigation of some kind.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.

But Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo, saying Wednesday it is clear what the president was after.

Schiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always ""reciprocal,"" a comment he made after noting how ""very very good"" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making certain requests.

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

On Wednesday, Schiff said all these details “are far more damning than I and others had imagined.”

“This is the Ukrainian president who is desperate for military support…[Trump] tells him he has a favor to ask,” he said.

Schiff added: “[Trump] communicates that the U.S. has done a lot for Ukraine, but there is not much reciprocity. This is how a mafia boss talks. 'What have you done for us? I have a favor I want to ask you.'”

“Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. To investigate the Bidens,” Schiff said, adding that another “layer” of misconduct was Trump’s attempt to use Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as “emissaries” who would be “part and parcel in this.”

UKRAINE CALL WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWED 'POLITICAL BIAS,' FAVORED TRUMP'S 'RIVAL' CANDIDATE: MEMO

“The fact that the president would invoke the attorney general sends a further message to Ukraine—this is not just me asking, this is not just Giuliani asking, but this is the United States government,” Schiff said.

The transcript shows Trump saying he wanted the Ukrainian president to speak with both Barr and Giuliani.

“There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff continued. “Ukraine understood what this president wanted. He had his emissaries making it clear, and Ukraine knew what it needed to do if it wanted to get military assistance.”

Schiff and other top committee chairs later released a statement saying: ""Let’s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections—that is betrayal enough."" The chairmen added that they will subpoena the White House and State Department for a related whistleblower complaint and other information, should they miss a Thursday deadline to turn it over.

This stance suggests Democrats will charge ahead on their impeachment inquiry, ""quid pro quo"" or not.

Schiff is likely to be a key figure in the process, as Pelosi's Tuesday decision takes all Trump-focused investigations from six prominent House committees and puts them all “under one umbrella,” according to a Democratic source.

Pelosi, on Wednesday, also stood by the need for impeachment.

“The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,” she said in a statement. “Clearly, the Congress must act.”

Biden himself also said in a statement that the document “makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent.”

But the White House and Trump allies adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory.

White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.”

House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., also said there was no quid pro quo, and said the Democrats “leapt to conclusions before looking at the facts.”

“The real danger here is that Democrats keep using baseless accusations in hopes of crippling a successful presidency,” Collins said in a statement Wednesday.

While the transcript does show Trump asking Zelensky to probe Biden, it does not show Trump explicitly linking U.S. aid to Ukraine. Administration officials told Fox News on Tuesday that, at the time, U.S. aid to Ukraine was frozen, but claimed that it was over corruption concerns and other countries not paying their fair share.

Meanwhile, Democrats are moving on other fronts as well.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has called for Barr to step aside from any review of the matter.

“The President dragged the Attorney General into this mess,” Nadler tweeted. “At a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter.”

The Justice Department, though, has denied involvement in any potential investigations into Biden or anything else.

“The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine—on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine—on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter, or anything related to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

Meanwhile, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., questioned why Giuliani was involved in the first place.

“What role does Rudolph Giuliani have in this government?” he asked during a House Democratic press conference Wednesday. “Is he in the Department of Justice? Is he the secretary of state? Is he an ambassador to Ukraine or to the European Union?”

“Rudolph Giuliani is the president’s political hit man,” he continued. “And in an official conversation with the president of Ukraine, he directed the Ukrainian president to have a follow up conversation with Giuliani as part of the effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.”

The Washington Post on Wednesday reported that Giuliani has been involved in pursuing a ""shadow agenda"" with Ukraine—an allegation the former New York City mayor has denied, calling it “complete nonsense.”

He tweeted Wednesday: ""The transcript really shows how dishonest news media is. Unlike Joe Biden, no military aid was withheld, no threats, and absolutely no pressure. Zelensky introduces me into the conversation, not POTUS Trump.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter or Joe, a frontrunner to be Trump's Democratic rival in the 2020 election.

The White House’s release of the transcript came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., formally announced an impeachment probe into the president.

The Ukraine call is one part of a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's actions.

The Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel on Wednesday morning released an opinion on the whistleblower’s complaint, which had claimed to report a matter of “urgent concern.” The OLC determined that the complaint, though, “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” and does not require that the director of national intelligence “transmit the complaint to the intelligence committees.”

UKRAINE CALL MEMO SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, BUT DID NOT MENTION AID

This determination is at the heart of a disagreement that has pitted the DOJ and intelligence director against the inspector general and congressional Democrats. The latter maintain that the complaint should be turned over to Congress. Such a step is being considered, though the White House released a rough transcript Wednesday morning showing Trump indeed pressed Ukraine to look into Biden family dealings, as had been alleged. But Trump, in the transcript, did not explicitly tie the request to military aid.

Included in the OLC opinion, though, was a section that revealed the whistleblower showed indications of a “political bias” -- as Fox News first reported Tuesday -- while saying that the inspector general still believed the allegations were credible.

“Although the ICIG’s preliminary review found ‘some indica of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,’ the ICIG concluded that the complaint’s allegations nonetheless appeared credible,” the opinion said.

The name of the rival candidate was not revealed in the opinion. Fox News previously reported that the whistleblower also did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to sources.

The OLC opinion came in conjunction with the released transcript of the president’s call with Zelensky. The whistleblower complaint alleged that unnamed “White House officials” had “expressed concern about the content of a telephone call between the President and a foreign leader.”

READ UKRAINE CALL MEMO

According to the ICIG, “statements made by the president during the call could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of campaign-finance laws.”

The DOJ has not reached such a determination.

The transcript, declassified by Trump, indicates the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. It begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually broaches the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

That refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, as Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

On Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky, a detail that fueled impeachment calls leading to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. But the call transcript does not show Trump mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip or otherwise.

The transcript shows Zelensky suggesting to Trump the Biden matter would be looked into by a new prosecutor. “He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,"" he said. ""The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.”

The release of the transcript and of the opinion from the OLC come after Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, answering mounting calls from her caucus to make the process official.

Democrats are seeking the whistleblower’s complaint in a full and unredacted format. The DNI general counsel said, though, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

But with virtually every aspect of this controversy being disputed, even the format of the document was challenged. The concerns focused on a notation on the document saying it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call.

This detail was seized upon by critics to challenge its accuracy, though the administration maintained the document is reliable.

New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “what they are calling a ‘transcript’ isn’t even a transcript. It’s a collection of notes.”

“This is what they are *admitting* to and it’s way above and beyond what is necessary for impeachment,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Journalists also pushed back against it: “We have to refrain from calling it a verbatim transcript,” tweeted Brian Karem, the Playboy writer and CNN contributor.

However, the Trump administration is defending the accuracy of the document.

A senior Department of Justice official told Fox News that DOJ officials interviewed knowledgeable people about the process for creating the transcript and are confident the document is accurate.

Fox News has learned it reflects the standard process for documenting calls with foreign leaders. It is essentially a compilation of what two Situation Room officers wrote down while listening in on the call in real time. A source familiar with the White House Situation Room staff confirmed that the two transcribers who listened in on Trump’s call are CIA employees detailed to the White House from the agency.

What the White House is calling a “transcript” is as close to a verbatim readout of this call as exists.

An audio recording of the call itself does not exist, as the policy of the Situation Room is that head of state calls are not typically recorded.

The document, declassified by Trump on Tuesday as Democrats are pressing forward with impeachment, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call, according to the rough transcript. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that an intelligence community whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's July conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump, who has been accused of trying to pressure Zelensky to investigate the family of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in exchange for releasing military aid, authorized the release of a memorandum of the conversation, which was made public earlier Wednesday.

The transcript shows that Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings in the Eastern European country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo

Trump released the transcript as Democrats suspected he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into influencing the 2020 election -- specifically, that he threatened to withhold foreign aid if Zelensky didn't investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's conduct.

The transcript, although incomplete, did not show an explicit quid pro quo on Trump's part but did show the two leaders discussing the controversy surrounding Biden. “There's not an explicit quid pro quo here... is this a big bowl of nothing or is there really something here?” King asked.

King's question came after many Republicans accused Democratic politicians of grasping at straws in an attempt to undermine the president.

""Since @realDonaldTrump won in 2016, Democrats have repeatedly rushed to judgment and launched fishing expeditions – all designed to refute the will of the American people,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted after King's comments on Wednesday.

""The president must be held accountable,"" Pelosi said at a press conference late Tuesday. ""No one is above the law.""

Democrats have long been threatening impeachment against Trump, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his nearly two-year investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Pelosi has been reluctant to formally open an inquiry, worrying that it would doom her caucus coming into the 2020 elections.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.""

Trump announced Tuesday that he will release the full transcripts of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday after a whistleblower alleged that Trump tried to convince the foreign leader to investigate former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

""Secretary of State Pompeo [received] permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don’t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump said.

Meantime, a senior White House official told Fox News late Tuesday that the administration will release a document showing the intelligence community inspector general found the whistleblower had “political bias” in favor of “a rival candidate” of the president.

The official did not identify the name of the rival candidate.

Separately, a senior administration official told Fox News the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump's conversations with the leader of Ukraine, as long as it's legally possible.

Trump was accused of pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden in connection with his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday against accusations that Trump pressured Zelensky over Hunter Biden while also holding back nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.

Starr, a former independent counsel and U.S. solicitor general, responded on ""America's Newsroom"" to Democrats who are demanding that the White House release the transcript of the call.

Bernie Sanders sinks to a distant third in a number of new national and early voting state polls, top members of his presidential campaign are taking aim at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- the other progressive superstar in the Democratic nomination race who’s soared ahead of Sanders in the surveys.

The swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator's campaign, with a hitherto ""truce"" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the independent senator’s campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.”

WARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD

Sanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their ""Medicare-for-all"" proposals.

And both had refrained from attacking each other.

“Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders.

Sanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”

But that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders' team from taking aim at Warren.

The Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts.

Gray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign's lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June.

Sanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff.

In another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.”

As they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot.

WARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID

While Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.

“They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

The strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.”"

""If you want to show me evidence, I'm open-minded,"" said the former presidential candidate.

""It's so corrupt,"" he said.

The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment.

The document, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. A notation on the memo says it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call. It is still presented in transcript form.

The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject of Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said in the phone call.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.”



DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”

“The first week, I thought, the terrible thing is that people are going to judge me now by a different standard. If I can just muddle through life, they'll say it was a great achievement, given this. I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

Swalwell accuses President Trump of 'betrayal' over Ukraine phone call,https://www.foxnews.com/media/eric-swalwell-trump-betrayal-ukraine,"Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., accused President Trump of ""betrayal"" Tuesday after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry over the commander-in-chief's interactions with Ukraine's president.

""When you ask a foreign government for help you owe them something which means one day you may have to put another country's interests ahead of America's interests, which to me is betrayal,"" Swalwell said on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum.""

Trump allegedly pushed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Biden has acknowledged that while he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT

Sources told Fox News that Trump personally ordered White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he allegedly discussed the potential investigation of the Bidens with Zelensky.

When MacCallum asked Swalwell about the importance of the intelligence community whistleblower report, the congressman said it was not needed for an investigation and described it as ""color.""

""We already have the president's admission... he's copped to the crime. So we don't really need the whistleblower report,"" Swalwell said. ""I think it will add color to the investigation.""

Swalwell also said Trump's alleged comments during the phone call was enough for impeachment.

""But again, if that had never happened -- if he had never worked with the Russians or embraced their help or obstructed justice or took money from foreign nationals, this act alone would be impeachable, ""Swalwell said.

The congressman also believes direct ""quid pro quo"" statements are not needed, that the president's own words are enough to impeach.

""When you listen to the president's own words, by asking the Ukrainians to do this when you ask somebody to do something you owe them something in the future... that's enough,"" Swalwell said.

Richard Painter, the former White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, began by claiming there was ""no evidence"" that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, were involved with corruption in Ukraine, as Trump has alleged. But when asked about Trump's ""attempted collusion"" with Ukraine, Painter declared it was an ""impeachable offense.""

“This is an impeachable offense, turning the powers of a foreign government against a candidate in the United States who is a political rival of Donald Trump, this in and of itself is impeachable,” Painter said. “This president has committed multiple high crimes and misdemeanors and what is happening when the House refuses to impeach him, he continues to do more and more of it.”

REP. AL GREEN WARNS DEMS: 'THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO TURN ON US' IF WE DON'T IMPEACH TRUMP

Painter went on to say that Trump ""feels emboldened"" as House Democrats remain stagnant on impeachment and gave a grim forecast for the Democratic Party if they don't take action.

“As Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi doesn’t have the courage to impeach him, he’s going to keep on doing it. He is getting a pass from this Congress,"" Painter continued. ""It’s critically important that the House not only start impeachment investigations formally but that they vote out articles of impeachment, all of the evidence is already there. We don’t need more to impeach this president and if they don’t do it, I think the Democrats are going to lose in 2020, and probably deserve to lose.”

The debate among Democrats over Trump's impeachment was revived last week after it was reported that a whistleblower from the intelligence community flagged what was being described as a ""troubling"" interaction the president had with a foreign leader. It was later reported that Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden's son and the president has since been accused of leveraging financial aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on the 2020 Democratic frontrunner."

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

This came as House Democrats officially launched a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday afternoon, fueled by a whistleblower’s accusation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his potential 202O opponent, Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. The whistleblower alleged that Trump had ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before his phone call with Zelensky. The whistleblower said Trump told Zelensky that he would not release the aid unless he investigated Biden.

A source familiar with the situation has told Fox News the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call and Trump has agreed to release a transcript on Wednesday. Trump has denied any wrongdoing on the call.

""He is gone. It's only a matter of time now and negotiation. @realDonaldTrump is done,"" Scaramucci said.

The impeachment debate was renewed last week after a ""whistleblower"" from the intelligence community called attention to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the president, with aid to Ukraine frozen, allegedly urged an investigation into Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who'd had business dealings there.

The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Richard Burr, R-N.C., told Fox News he and several other members of the congressional intelligence panels were still in the process of reading the complaint, which raised red flags about a July 25 phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian leader.

The complaint alleged that Trump tried to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter for possible corruption in exchange for U.S. aid.

""I think that what this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing,"" Schiff told Fox News as he left the SCIF -- sensitive compartmentalized information facility -- on Wednesday.""I think the travesty is that this complaint was withheld as long as it was because it was an urgent matter.

Neither Schiff nor Swalwell would confirm the specifics of the complaint and related documents that they reviewed.

On a related note, the House also voted on a resolution Wednesday to have the complaint by an unnamed member of the intelligence community be released to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees before hearings on Thursday with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire are scheduled to take place.

In one sense this moment was probably inevitable. Most Democrats and most of the media have never accepted Mr. Trump as a legitimate President. They can’t believe 63 million Americans voted for him over their nominee, Hillary Clinton, so they have looked every day since Election Night in 2016 for some reason to expel him from office.

They spent two years spinning a tale of Russian collusion that proved to be false. Then they hyped obstruction of justice because Mr. Trump fired James Comey as FBI director, but the public wasn’t persuaded. The payment to Stormy Daniels made a cameo, but that was too close to Democrats’ defense of Bill Clinton for “lying about sex” to fly.

Mrs. Pelosi has now found a rationale in a whistleblower’s accusation about Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call to Ukraine’s President. Mr. Trump admits that he warned Volodymyr Zelensky about corruption, including Joe Biden ’s interventions in Ukraine against a prosecutor who was investigating a company with ties to Mr. Biden ’s son, Hunter. Mr. Trump also admits that he delayed U.S. aid to Ukraine in early July prior to the phone call out of concern for corruption and allied burden sharing."

FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID

A growing number of House Democrats have supported an impeachment probe against Trump after it was revealed that the administration froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before the president allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The president said Tuesday that he would release an unredacted transcript of the phone call.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA ‘FRENZY’

Dingell told Fox News’ ""Outnumbered Overtime” that if Trump did not make investigating Biden a condition of releasing the aid, then why did the White House block it being provided to the two intelligence committees?”



“Now we get information that the Inspector General for Homeland Security determined that there was a real credible threat to our national security,” she added.

Dingell's endorsement of an impeachment inquiry marks a change for the third-term congresswoman. In March, she told ""Fox News Sunday"" that "" I do not think an impeachment should ever be a partisan event. I think we need to have Republicans and Democrats or it will tear this country apart. It's a very serious movement.""

Administration sources told Fox News that the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Those sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding.

“Today isn't what impeachment looks like, and this afternoon's press conference changes nothing legally,” Collins said in a statement following the speaker’s announcement on Tuesday. “There has been no House vote to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry.”

He added “If Democrats believed the facts were in their favor, they would provide the due process that the House provided under the Clinton and Nixon impeachments.”

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

On Tuesday Pelosi, D-Calif., said: ""The president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

She effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the Democratic caucus to act. The move could support Democrats' disputed argument in court that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents.

Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

But there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi's gambit could backfire, as Republicans predicted over the weekend.

“No matter how many Democrats subscribe to the fantasy that the House began an impeachment inquiry—whether in March, July, August or September—neither Chairman [Jerrold] Nadler nor Speaker Pelosi have unilateral authority to launch one,"" Collins said on Tuesday night.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and fellow Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have been investigating Trump as part of what they've called impeachment proceedings. Notably, Nadler hauled Trump's former 2016 campaign manager, Cory Lewandowski, in front of his committee last week for a combative five hours of testimony related to possible impeachable conduct by the president.

AOC ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: 'WHAT HE HAS ADMITTED TO IS ALREADY IMPEACHABLE, REGARDLESS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS'

On Tuesday evening, Pelosi announced that multiple House committees are now moving forward with an impeachment inquiry.

""This is the first partisan 'impeachment' in the history of the republic, and the real victims are the American people,” Collins said. “They elected Donald Trump to be our president and their representatives to solve the border crisis and support a growing economy. Instead of accepting those facts, Democrats are sowing chaos, not producing legislative solutions.”

He went on to say, “The chaos began in the Judiciary Committee, and now it's seeping into the rest of the House.”

Trump vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky by Wednesday.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE 'SHAKEDOWN'

The committee chairs -- Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. -- helped turn up the pressure on the White House as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., started pursuing official impeachment proceedings. During her Tuesday announcement, Pelosi specifically accused the administration of breaking the law by suppressing a whistleblower from reporting on Trump's comments to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The committees' subpoena threat came just after the White House released a transcript of the president's July call with Zelensky in an apparent attempt to assuage concerns he engaged in some kind of quid pro quo.

The transcript contained no explicit quid pro quo for foreign aid but stoked Democrats' concerns as it showed Trump requesting an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden at a sensitive time in U.S.-Ukrainian relations.

Democrats suspected that Trump tried to interfere in the 2020 election by pressuring Zelensky into pursuing allegations that Biden, seen as the frontrunner among Democrats seeking to unseat Trump, improperly influenced the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in order to protect his son Hunter. Shokin had been investigating a natural gas firm that Hunter Biden led as a member of the board of directors.

'SQUAD' MEMBERS CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT AFTER TRUMP RELEASES UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT: 'WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT'

""Let’s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections -- that is betrayal enough. The corruption exists whether or not Trump threatened -- explicitly or implicitly -- that a lack of cooperation could result in withholding military aid,"" the statement by chairs of the House Oversight, Judiciary, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs committees read.

“Ukraine depends on the U.S. for economic, military, and diplomatic support -- especially in its attempts to push back against Russian aggression -- and is particularly vulnerable to pressure from any U.S. president. For a country so reliant on the United States, nothing more was needed.

""The call reportedly was preceded by a decision by Trump to withhold vital security assistance, and it was followed in quick succession by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, meeting with a top aide to the new Ukrainian president at Trump’s direction. According to reports, the Ukrainians eventually became aware that the aid was being withheld and expressed concern to U.S. officials.""

Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has admitted to telling Ukraine to investigate Biden but maintained it was not a part of any broader attempt to influence the 2020 presidential election.

Fox News Exclusive: White House to release document showing intel community watchdog found whistleblower had 'political bias,' official says

A senior Trump administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the administration will release a document showing the intelligence community inspector general found the whistleblower who leveled an explosive accusation against President Trump concerning his talks with Ukraine had “political bias” in favor of “a rival candidate” of the president. The official did not identify the name of the rival candidate.

Separately, a senior administration official told Fox News the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump's conversations with the leader of Ukraine, as long as it's legally possible. The news came just hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry by alleging that the administration was hiding the complaint. Other top Democrats had previously said such an inquiry was already underway.

The senior administration official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, and that the White House's general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump's conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's July call with Zelensky. Trump vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of the call by Wednesday. Click here for more on our top story.

Giuliani, Republicans: Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of Trump will backfire

One of the biggest questions is whether House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump will backfire. Democrats have suggested Trump, in his call with Zelensky, tried to convince the Ukraine government into investigating potential 2020 presidential election opponent Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the Biden family's business dealings. The president, Democrats have suggested, had $400 million in aid to Ukraine frozen to pressure officials into pursuing the Biden investigation. The Trump administration says the decision to freeze funding came more than a week before his call with Zelensky and that it was based on concerns about broader Ukraine corruption.

The contents of the call, as well as the whistleblower complaint, could throw cold water on Democrats' explosive suggestions. A senior administration official told Fox News there are a “few words” in the transcript that will raise eyebrows, but it is nowhere near as inflammatory as Democrats have suggested. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

Plus, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani -- who has long publicly called for Ukraine to investigate Biden's dealings in Ukraine -- posted a series of messages on Twitter suggesting Democrats have a bigger problem on their hands with corruption involving ""high level members of the Obama cabinet"" and ""multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play."" ""Slimy Joe is not alone,"" Giuliani tweeted. Click on the video above to see Giuliani's appearance on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

Meanwhile, Trump is set to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani all but closed the door on potentially meeting with President Trump this week, and blamed the commander-in-chief for damaging relations between the two countries, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on Tuesday. Rouhani, in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, was asked if there was any chance the two leaders would speak to each other this week.

""Why would we bump into one another?"" the Iranian leader told Wallace. ""If we seek to pursue higher goals to benefit both countries, both people, it must be planned, and talks must be based on those plans. But prior to that, we must create mutual trust and that is something that Mr. Trump took away from this framework."" Rouhani is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday.

Temporary workers have been the top request among union members, according to the Detroit Free Press.

The union wants those workers to get a path to being permanent and as temps, get pay and benefits that more closely match their permanent counterparts.

The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.

""The horse is out of the barn,"" said former Hillary Clinton pollster and strategist Geoff Garin. ""Saddle up.""

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. He also called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a ""disgrace,"" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and an administration official told the Journal that Trump's actions on the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing.""

Another official told the paper that the Trump administration internally maintained at the time that Ukraine's corruption problems were a consideration in the aid decision. Trump's decision to freeze Ukraine funding reportedly came more than a week before his call with Zelensky.

""The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up."" — Geoff Garin

Fox News has not independently confirmed the reports, which rocked Capitol Hill even as Democrats insisted they were keeping the developments in perspective. While Democrats are set to meet Tuesday to discuss Ukraine and possible impeachment proceedings, the top House aide told Fox News that trade – not Ukraine – would headline Democrats' agenda at a separate planned caucus meeting Wednesday.

""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade,"" the aide told Fox News. ""A second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon.""

Something of an impeachment inquiry dam broke late Monday, when seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it's impeachable. The lawmakers – Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia – come largely from swing districts where Trump is popular but voters split.

The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.""

“These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.”

Later in the night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell also endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could quickly lead to actual impeachment.

""On behalf of the people who elected us, we must formalize and accelerate the impeachment process so that Congress, by exercising its responsibility under Article 1 of the Constitution, can provide some measure of accountability,"" Schatz said in a statement.

The flurry of moves brings to 154 the number of House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.)

Democrats have presented conflicting views, in court and in public, as to whether impeachment proceedings are already in progress. The renewed push on Monday could galvanize remaining Democrats to openly call their efforts an impeachment probe.

FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED

Meanwhile, a report in Politico late Monday suggested that Democrats may vote on a resolution to condemn Trump for allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leadership to investigate possible corruption by Joe Biden's son Hunter relating to his business dealings in the country.

And The Washington Post reported in the evening that Pelosi was sounding out members of the Democratic caucus to see if the time has come to impeach the president.

However, earlier Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of Trump's conversation with Zelensky.

The source said that it was made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call.

Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

Nevertheless, Democrats have pressed forward on the issue, even as it risked backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by the former vice president.

""The Senate Republican 'see no evil, hear no evil' attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. ""This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.""

The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.

In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week.

""It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,"" McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an ""appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner.""

At least one Republican lawmaker has also called for the release of the transcript of Trump's call.

""At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic and onetime presidential rival.

UKRAINE CONTROVERSY BOILS OVER ON SENATE FLOOR

Meanwhile, top Republicans including California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted in interviews with Fox News that the gambit would backfire for Democrats.

And in an exclusive interview with Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said Democrats' accusations were about to boomerang.

""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence claimed.

Late Sunday evening, Trump sounded a similar note, tweeting the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.""

Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. The prosecutor, at the time, was investigating possible corruption involving a natural gas firm with close ties to Hunter Biden.

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.

And earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

At the same time, Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.""

The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.

The whistleblower drama kicked into gear after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. Democrats have sought the full whistleblower complaint and testimony from the whistleblower.

But Maguire has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., warned Sunday. ""Thank you for your patriotism.""

Pelosi went on: ""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest.""

Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have hard evidence that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia.

""Why doesn’t the president just say, 'Release the whistleblower complaint.' Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,"" Schiff said. ""This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.""

The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery tweet: ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.""

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

But that’s not quite what the conversation revealed. No matter.

Pelosi and rabid Trump-hating Democrats long ago preordained their impeachment ambitions. Any pretext to achieve that end will do just fine. But the speaker’s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed. Pelosi and her confederates will do anything to undo the 2016 election results and drive Trump from office.

Nevertheless, facts are stubborn things. They are critical, if not dispositive, in legal cases. They are also highly relevant in the inherently political process known as impeachment.

MARC THIESSEN: TRUMP, UKRAINE AND DEMOCRATS' DOUBLE STANDARD

So, let’s examine what we have learned so far, realizing that many more facts have yet to be unspooled in what Trump is now calling the latest version of the interminable “witch hunt.”

The Telephone Conversation

The early reporting on the leaked conversation with Zelensky alleged that Trump demanded a “quid pro quo.” That is, Trump allegedly ordered Ukraine to help investigate allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, or the U.S. would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. However, the transcript shows no demands or conditions were stated or otherwise discussed. No promises were contingent on financial assistance. Did President Trump apply pressure on Zelensky? There is no evidence of that in their discussion.

Instead, after congratulating the Ukrainian president on his election to office, Trump asked Zelensky to help investigate matters of alleged wrongdoing involving “this whole situation with Ukraine.” Trump made vague references to Crowdstrike and “the server.”

This appears to be a reference to the origins of the Russia “collusion” investigation and the suspected role of Ukraine, the Democratic National Committee, and the cybersecurity firm that the DNC retained to examine hacked servers.

This part of the conversation is cryptic. But if Ukraine possesses some evidence of corrupt acts involving Democrats or Hillary Clinton surrogates or anyone else, this would logically be something that the U.S. should be made aware of.

The phone conversation between the two leaders then turned to fired Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Trump remarked how “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.” The videotape of Biden boasting of the “quid pro quo” he engineered is a remarkable lesson in hubris and foolishness.

The speaker’s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed.

By way of background, Shokin is on record telling the Washington Post that he was fired in 2015 because he was investigating Hunter Biden and his Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, and that then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion dollars in U.S. aid unless Shokin was sacked:

“I will answer that the activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the (prosecutor general’s office) investigators on his tail, are the only, I emphasize, the only motives for organizing my resignation.”

Fast forward to the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelensky telephone call. Zelensky volunteered that a new investigator would look into the matter. Trump asked Zelensky to speak with Attorney General William Barr and the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about it. This was not unreasonable.

Democrats, like Pelosi, claim that the conversation is absolute proof that Trump was asking a foreign government to help him damage his political opponent, Biden, in the upcoming election. But the proof is not absolute at all.

If the president of the United States is made aware of suspected corrupt acts by a public official involving a foreign nation, he has every right to ask that nation to either investigate and/or produce any evidence. Indeed, it is incumbent on him to do so.

One of the president’s fundamental duties is identified in the “take care” clause (or “faithful execution” clause) of the U.S. Constitution. It imposes duty on the chief executive to take care “that the Laws be faithfully executed.” President George Washington observed, “it is my duty to see the Laws executed; to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to that duty.”

Whether it be immigration laws or finance laws or criminal statutes, the president is duty-bound to enforce all laws. Failure to do so would be a dereliction of his duty, as our first president believed.

Biden does not get immunity simply because he used to be vice president or is currently running for president. Was Biden’s confessed “quid pro quo” pressure on Ukraine a potential crime? More facts and evidence is needed. But using your public office to benefit your son might constitute such corruption crimes as bribery or honest services fraud. On this basis, Trump had every right to ask for evidentiary assistance from a foreign power.

Unlike Biden, who threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer money from Ukraine, Trump did not explicitly mention the freezing of roughly $400 million from Kiev.

The president has repeatedly stated he put a hold on the funds because he was reticent about giving such an enormous sum of money to a newly elected president who was taking over a government widely known for corruption.

As columnist Marc Thiessen pointed out in the Washington Post, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durban, and Patrick Leahy had been far more overt two months earlier when, in a letter, “they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake” if the nation’s prosecutor general did not capitulate to their own demands over the closing of several investigations connected to the Mueller investigation. Hypocrisy, of course, is rampant throughout this sordid story.

The “Whistleblower” Complaint

All of this came to a sudden boil when a complaint was filed recently by a so-far unidentified employee of the intelligence community. Citing the Trump-Zelensky conversation that he or she did not hear or even read in transcript form, the employee nevertheless filed a whistleblower complaint against the president based on nothing more than hearsay.

The complaint was legal folly. It does not qualify as a whistleblower complaint as defined by the whistleblower statute (50 U.S.C. 3033). Why? Because a whistleblower cannot blow the whistle on the president.

This means that he or she is not really a “whistleblower” at all under the specific language and meaning of the law, as I argued in my column last week.

This was explained in an 11-page opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) when it issued the follow opinion:

“The president is not a member of the intelligence community, and his communication with a foreign leader involved no intelligence operation or other activity aimed at collecting or analyzing foreign intelligence.”

Under the whistleblower statute, both these conditions are required. Yet, neither were met. As a consequence, the complaint “does not trigger a reporting obligation” to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). This DOJ opinion is also shared by the General Counsel in the Office of the DNI.

Pelosi declared that the law is “unequivocal” that the DNI “shall” give Congress the whistleblower complaint. This would be true if the complaint qualified under the whistleblower law, but it does not. Pelosi was incorrect.

The OLC opinion made clear that the complaint “does not trigger a reporting obligation” and that the DNI does not have “a statutory obligation to forward the complaint to the intelligence committees.”

In our constitutional form of government, the president is a unitary executive. He is not in any department or agency. He is not a member of the intelligence community. A “whistleblower” can only complain about misconduct by someone in the intelligence community.

Acting DNI Joseph Maguire will appear at a public congressional hearing on Thursday. He will surely reiterate all of the above so that Pelosi, who bragged that she is an “authority” on the law, might understand what the law actually means.

Despite all of this, the speaker and Democrats are determined to pursue their impeachment dreams. Facts and evidence are of little consequence.

After all, many pundits, especially on the left, longed for the same outcome during the Russia investigation, only to be bitterly disappointed.

But the Ukraine uproar has a far simpler story line than the complicated Russia probe. And it proved a tipping point for the House speaker, who has long believed that impeachment could boomerang on the Democrats without ultimately ousting Trump, who she sees as highly vulnerable in 2020. But with 175 of her members, including some moderates, hopping on the impeachment bandwagon, Pelosi could no longer stem the tide.

HOW TRUMP AND ALLIES ARE SHIFTING THE UKRAINE SPOTLIGHT TO BIDEN

In a flag-bedecked speech, Pelosi said Trump’s actions on Ukraine “have seriously violated the Constitution,” that he “must be held accountable,” and announcing an “official” investigation by a half-dozen committees.

As strange as it sounds, Pelosi’s reluctant move could in some ways help Trump, because it shifts the terms of debate.

Trump’s preferred mode of defense is to go on offense—whether it’s against Crooked Hillary, Mueller’s angry Democrats or Sleepy Joe’s alleged transgressions. It’s all about demonizing the other side, just as the left does to Trump.

Especially after his planned release today of a transcript of his July call with Ukraine’s leader, the president and his allies can argue that even if he went too far in bringing up Joe Biden with a foreign leader, it does not warrant the drastic remedy of impeachment.

He’s already called it “witch hunt garbage,” and will undoubtedly cast it as one perpetrated by his enemies in the opposition party, the press and the Deep State. He can energize his supporters, who will see their hero in danger of being forced from office. And the resulting fireworks will not only obliterate any semblance of a Democratic agenda, it will overshadow what Biden, Bernie, Elizabeth and the rest are doing on the trail.

Trump asked, not unreasonably, how Pelosi could take this step without even having seen the details of the phone call.

Outside the hothouse of the media and political world, I don’t sense that Ukraine has quite reached the level of a political earthquake. And that, for the moment, has the president’s critics baffled.

I believe the media coverage is a key factor, as I’ll explain in a moment.

But first, there’s no doubt that the Washington Post moved the ball with a report that Trump told his acting chief of staff “to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials.”

The piece says that OMB officials relayed Trump’s order to State and the Pentagon, and were ordered to give members of Congress no explanation beyond that the delay was part of an “interagency process.”

The story also quoted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy as saying that Ukrainian President Zelensky told him during a visit this month that the aid was cut off as a “consequence” of his unwillingness to launch a probe of the Bidens. (The money has since been released.)

The president did not deny the story but shifted his explanation, saying he held up the money because he wanted Europe to pay more for Ukraine’s defense. He also scoffed at the notion of impeachment before his speech at the U.N., telling reporters: “What Joe Biden did for his son, that’s something they should be looking at.”

The New York Times’ Peter Baker reported yesterday morning that Trump now seems to be saying, as the headline puts it, “So What If I Did?”

The piece calls this “an astonishing breach of the norms governing the American presidency…If anything, the president has grown even more defiant since Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, almost as if having avoided charges, he is daring the establishment to come after him again. The man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent.”

With more House Democrats coming out for impeachment—more than two-thirds of Nancy Pelosi’s caucus is now in that camp—the question of whether Ukraine is a dramatic tipping point looms large.

My sense is that there’s a fatigue factor for Trump scandals. And besides the president and Rudy Giuliani trying to shift the spotlight to the Bidens, as I wrote yesterday, the media coverage of the last few years is coloring the current climate.

Take the Bob Mueller probe. While I’ve always argued the Russia investigation was a legitimately big story that led to several high-level indictments, can anyone really dispute that the coverage was so histrionic as to be misleading? The constant drumbeat was so relentless and so negative that it seemed only a matter of time before Trump was run out of town. Every minor development was cranked up to 11.

And while the final report contained disturbing material, it also found no evidence that Trump actively cooperated with Russian operatives or hackers, and Mueller’s halting testimony was the final nail in the coffin.

When the media fixated for more than a week on Sharpie-gate—and yes, Trump fueled the coverage with daily blasts about his handling of the hurricane—it was another case of runaway hype.

The same was true in episode after episode: Porn stars! Michael Cohen! S-hole countries! Omarosa! Tax returns! Greenland! Go back where they came from! Rat-infested Baltimore!

Most of these controversies were very real, sometimes troubling, and yet trumpeted with a this-time-he’s-gone-too-far tone until each story faded. Trump’s constant pushback against the “fake news media,” and his attacks on Democrats and “witch hunt” investigators, added to the feeling that these were nothing more than partisan brawls.

In other words, journalists are suffering from boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome. Now that they have extremely serious allegations to pursue, the ensuing uproar sounds too much like so many other scandals and mini-scandals that, fairly or unfairly, didn’t move the needle.

There’s also an emerging theory, argued for some time by the Federalist’s Ben Domenech, that Trump wants to be impeached.

Ross Douthat, the conservative, anti-Trump New York Times columnist, expanded on this view yesterday:

“If the Democrats impeach him they will be doing something unpopular instead of something popular… the likely Democratic nominees are all more popular than Trump, and so anything that puts the Democrats on the wrong side of public opinion may look better, through Trump’s eyes, than the status quo…

“Trump is happy to pit his overt abuses of power against the soft corruption of his foes. This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president’s critics find particularly infuriating — the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself.”

Whether or not you agree that he did something wrong, he excels at these dual-corruption debates, that it’s the other side that should face prison terms.

No president, not even Donald Trump, wants to be impeached. But if past journalistic excesses help convince the public that the Ukraine story is just more exaggeration, and if the press is viewed as a pro-impeachment movement, Trump will paint the media as helping the Democrats try to end his term."

Almost immediately thereafter, Trump insisted that his call with the Ukrainian leader was innocent and innocuous.

Indeed, Trump announced yesterday that he’d authorized the release of an “unredacted transcript” of the call, which he said would prove that it was nothing more than “a very friendly and totally appropriate call,” in which he asserted “no pressure” on his foreign counterpart.

This morning, the Republican added, “Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?”

I have a very strong hunch that those waiting for an apology will be waiting a very long time.

President Donald Trump, in a midsummer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked him to look into why that country’s top prosecutor apparently had ended an investigation of the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

The entirety of the document is available online here (pdf), posted to the White House’s website. It is not an actual, literal transcript, but the memo purports to give a rough approximation of what the two leaders discussed during their 30-minute July 25 phone call.

And after reading it, I haven’t the foggiest idea why Trump or anyone in his orbit would think it’s good for him.

Some of the details that stood out for me:

* Trump twice told Zelenskiy that the United States has been “very, very good” to Ukraine, shortly before the American president asks for a political “favor” from his counterpart.

* Trump argued, “I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.” He seemed to be referring to a prosecutor who’d been the subject of international condemnations for staggering ineptitude.

* Trump urged Zelenskiy to cooperate with Rudy Giuliani, who was trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man,” the memo quotes the American president saying. “He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”

* Speaking of the attorney general, Trump also suggested Zelenskiy should coordinate with Bill Barr: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.”

* Trump also appears to have referenced “servers” and “Crowdstrike,” suggesting he expected Ukraine to also help dig up dirt related to Hillary Clinton’s emails.

Far from an exoneration, the newly released memo points to an American president pressing the leader of Ukraine to work with his team on targeting a domestic political rival.

What’s more, this damaging revelation is only a piece of a larger puzzle – and the emerging picture may yet look worse if/when we see the complaint from the intelligence community’s whistleblower.

The case for Trump’s impeachment just got stronger."

This person filed a complaint about alleged presidential wrongdoing with his/her inspector general, going by the book.

And now that previously classified complaint is available – with minimal redactions – for everyone to read.

A whistleblower’s complaint about President Donald Trump, made public on Thursday, says White House officials were so concerned about what the president said in a July call with Ukraine’s new leader that they intervened to “lock down” the record of the phone call. The whistleblower, whose name has not been released, says he lodged the formal complaint because he believed that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 election. In the call, Trump discussed having the Ukrainian president help investigate the Biden family’s business dealings.

The nine-page complaint is available online here (pdf), while the seven-page letter from Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson is available here (pdf).

Near the very beginning of the whistleblower’s complaint, note that it accuses Donald Trump of pressuring “a foreign country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political rivals.” The whistleblower, whose identity is still unknown to the public, added that Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, is “a central figure” in the political scheme, before describing Attorney General Barr, the nation’s chief law-enforcement official, as someone who “appears to be involved as well.”

* The complaint says, “I learned from multiple U.S. Officials that senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down’ all the records of the phone call [between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky], especially the word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room.” He/she added that White House lawyers “directed” that a transcript of the call be removed from the computer system.

It suggests that White House officials not only realized that Trump went too far, but also that the White House took steps to cover up his abuse.

* White House officials told the whistleblower after the call that “they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

* “Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani’s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth.”

* Multiple U.S. officials told the whistleblower that Ukrainian leaders were “led to believe” that a meeting between Trump and Zelensky would depend on whether the Ukrainian president “showed willingness to ‘play ball.’”

* The complaint says there were other instances in which White House officials hid transcripts of Trump phone calls “for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive – rather than national security sensitive – information.”

* Toward the end of the complaint, the whistleblower added that Trump “instructed” Vice President Pence in May to cancel a scheduled trip to Ukraine. Trump wanted to delay top-level meetings until he saw how Zelensky “chose to act.”

Between yesterday’s revelations and today’s, we’re seeing a one-two punch that significantly increases the odds that the American president will be impeached.

Meanwhile, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire, who received the whistleblower complaint but did not originally share it with lawmakers as required by law, is testifying before the House Intelligence Committee right now."

As the Los Angeles Times reported, Trump went quite a bit further today, using the word “treason” in reference to the whistleblower and his/her White House sources.

“Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call – heard something and decided that he or she, or whoever the hell they saw – they’re almost a spy,” Trump said. “I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,” he continued. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

The not-so-subtle implication of the comments – an audio clip of which is now available – is that Trump longs for the days in which Americans were “smart” enough to impose severe physical punishments on those he perceived as traitors.

This comes on the heels of comments in which the sitting president suggested Joe Biden is guilty of misdeeds that would warrant “the electric chair” if committed by a Republican.

Let’s not forget that the intelligence community’s whistleblower may yet provide testimony, raising questions about whether, and to what degree, Trump may hope to intimidate him or her. The same concerns relate to the whistleblower’s White House sources, who may be considered witnesses to presidential wrongdoing.

As for Trump’s “treason” reference, this comes on the heels of the president raising the prospect of a treason investigation into Google, which came on the heels of Trump accusing some in federal law enforcement of “treason,” which came a month after the Republican accused congressional Democrats of engaging in “treasonous” behavior.

As regular readers know, these weren’t isolated incidents. Last year, the New York Times published a rather extraordinary op-ed, written by “a senior official in the Trump administration,” describing a White House in which “many” officials work diligently behind the scenes to subvert Donald Trump. The president suggested the newspaper may have committed “treason” by agreeing to run it.

A few months before that, the president was so bothered by media coverage of his summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un that he described the reports as “really almost treasonous.”

And a few months before that, while whining that Democrats failed to applaud his State of the Union address to his satisfaction, the president said Dems “certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much” – and then raised the prospect of Democratic “treason.”

Now he’s using the same word while complaining about those in his administration who helped expose his efforts to get a foreign government to help his re-election campaign."

But as the political world experiences this earthquake, the president isn't the only one wobbling,",2019-09-26,MSNBC,A scandal featuring a striking cast of...,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scandal-featuring-striking-cast-characters,"At a press conference yesterday, Donald Trump noted that Vice President Mike Pence also spoke privately to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy – and if we saw exactly what was said, those interactions were “perfect.”

“I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation because he had a couple conversations also. I can save you a lot of time. They’re all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations. “But the word is that they’re going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence’s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect.”

The reference to “the first phone conversation” was apparently Trump pointing to a conversation with the Ukrainian leader in April, which may itself be controversial.

But I was also glad to see Trump reference Pence, because his role is of some interest, too. The vice president recently met with Zelensky in Poland, and according to the official transcript, a reporter asked Pence whether his discussion with the Ukrainian leader focused at all on Joe Biden. Pence said no, though he added soon after, “But as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.”

It’s become clear that when Team Trump is talking to Ukraine about “corruption,” it’s little more than a euphemism for the American president’s conspiracy theories and political agenda.

Pence went on to say at the press conference that he told Zelensky that he would “carry back to President Trump the progress that he and his administration in Ukraine are making on dealing with corruption in their country.”

All of which serves as a reminder: Donald Trump may very well be impeached, but this is a controversy with a striking cast of characters. Indeed, Pence’s possible role in the mess is of interest, but he’s hardly alone.

There are related questions about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo …

Lawmakers trying to unravel the controversy over President Donald Trump’s discussions with the leader of Ukraine are increasingly homing in on exactly what role Mike Pompeo played in the drama.

… and the president’s personal attorney …

Even as they publicly insist President Donald Trump did nothing wrong during his call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, his allies are privately acknowledging more serious concerns about the ethical questions raised and the potential political fallout from it – especially over the involvement of Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney.

… and the already scandalous attorney general …

The Trump administration’s release of notes documenting President Donald Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has raised questions about Trump’s relationship with Attorney General William Barr and whether he views Barr as someone whose job includes advocating for him on personal matters.

… and the acting White House chief of staff …

When Trump ordered military aid to Ukraine to be frozen, he went through his chief of staff and budget director Mick Mulvaney. Congress had passed the aid, and Ukraine was under military attack from Russia, a fact that made the halting of the assistance worrisome to numerous officials in two branches of government.

… and the unknown number of White House officials who told an intelligence community whistleblower that they witnessed the president “abuse his office for personal gain.”

To be sure, this is a Trump scandal, through and through. But as the political world experiences this earthquake, the president isn’t the only one wobbling,"

World stocks dropped on Wednesday after Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. Traders also recoiled after Trump criticized China's economic policies and warned of the ""immense power"" of social media platforms at the United Nations on Tuesday.

The Democratic Speaker of the House pulled the trigger in response to the US president reportedly withholding aid to Ukraine while pressuring its leader to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.

""The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution,"" Pelosi said. ""The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.""

The White House has agreed to release the transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and plans to turn over the whistleblower complaint that followed the call and sparked the impeachment effort to Congress by Thursday, according to CNBC.

""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. ""No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!""

A few hours later, he tweeted the impeachment inquiry amounted to ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT.""

""Markets won't like the uncertainty it brings. In previous instances (Nixon, Clinton) there has been rockiness for equities and the dollar,"" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said in a morning note.

Wilson warned the inquiry has a ""very low chance of success"" given the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to support impeachment, and said it was ""probably a storm in a tea cup.""

Trump's UN speech didn't ease anxieties

Trump's speech at the UN on Tuesday tempered traders' hopes for high-level talks between the US and China next month to resolve the trade war.

""Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,"" he said at the UN General Assembly, according to Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, Chinese officials called for the Trump administration, which has slapped tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods and blacklisted Chinese companies such as Huawei, to ease off.

""China-US relations today have once again come to a crossroads,"" Wang Yi, China's Foreign Minister, said in New York on Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post. ""While China opens wider to the US and the rest of the world, we expect the US to do the same to China and remove all unreasonable restrictions.""

""The political turmoil around Donald Trump's official impeachment inquiry, combined with rising fears of no agreement with China in October trade talks, turned the risk sentiment off across the global markets,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group.

Trump also took aim at US tech companies, flagging their ""immense power"" and warning ""a free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people,"" according to Bloomberg. His comments helped to wipe a combined $56 billion from the market capitalizations of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet-parent Google — the so-called FAANG stocks.

Here's the market roundup as of 10:22 a.m. in New York:"

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) went further than most Republicans in taking the controversy seriously. The Utahan said in tweet over the weekend that if the president “asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.”

We now know, of course, that the scenario Romney described is exactly what happened. Nevertheless, for his troubles, the senator faced an online attack from Trump. The signal to other GOP lawmakers wasn’t subtle: those who take a stand on principle should expect to face White House attacks, too.

As of yesterday, Romney wasn’t the only congressional Republican with concerns. The Washington Post reported overnight on new fissures in the GOP’s wall.

Several Senate Republicans were privately stunned Wednesday and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released a rough transcript of President Trump’s call with the Ukraine president that showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a “huge mistake” that the GOP now has to confront and defend – while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump.

It’s important not to overstate the broader dynamic: Trump still has the broad support of his party. Some are sincere, some are acting on partisan reflex, and some are afraid of pushback from the president’s far-right followers, but whatever the motivation, it’d be a mistake to assume Trump has reason to fear significant intra-party defections.

At least for now, that is.

That said, it would also be wrong to believe Republicans are united around the White House’s talking points. After having seen the rough transcript of Trump’s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Romney reiterated his “troubling in the extreme” concerns. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who expressed some modest concerns over the weekend, added yesterday that he considered Trump’s comments to Zelensky “inappropriate,” though the Pennsylvania senator added that he doesn’t see the matter as an impeachable offense.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who’s taken steps in a decidedly Trump-like direction of late, conceded yesterday, “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there.”

True to form, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was willing to say the Trump call summary “raises a number of important questions.”

Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican consultant with a client list that includes John McCain and Jeb Bush, told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell yesterday, “ ‘One Republican senator told me if it was a secret vote, 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump.”

I’d still set expectations low, but it’s a dynamic worth watching."

391,Deroy Murdock,"The roaring controversy over President Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden, and their respective actions toward Ukraine sorely lacks some key language: the word “extortion” and the phrase “obstruction of justice.”

In March 2016, then-Vice President Biden told Ukraine’s then-President Petro Poroshenko that the Eastern European nation would not get a $1 billion U.S. government loan guarantee unless it fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma Holdings — a natural gas extraction company whose board of directors included Hunter Biden, the veep’s son.

Shokin told The Hill’s John Solomon that plans for his probe “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”

WH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY WATCHDOG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS,' OFFICIAL SAYS

Hunter Biden reportedly earned some $50,000 per month for his services, although he had no expertise in gas production and didn’t know Ukraine from Utah. He was experienced, however, in being the son of the vice president of the United States who, as luck would have it, “was serving as the Obama administration’s point man on relations with Ukraine and rooting out bureaucratic corruption,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

Joe Biden must have been aware of Hunter’s term on Burisma’s board. Indeed, major news organizations raised serious questions about this arrangement.

“Hunter Biden’s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power,” read a May 14, 2014, Washington Post headline. And a June 8, 2014 Fox News story was headlined: “Ukraine energy firm hiring Biden’s son raises ethical concerns”

Joe Biden discussed his March 2016 showdown with Poroshenko in remarks before the Council on Foreign Relations, of which I am a member, on January 23, 2018.

“I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee,” the former vice president explained about his mission to Kiev, per the CFR’s transcript. “And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.”

“I said, ‘I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,’” Biden continued. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.’ I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. (Laughter.) He got fired.”

Biden’s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice.

And President Trump is the bad guy?

Also, the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine’s current president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden’s behavior supposedly is based on the complaint of a mysterious whistleblower.

However, it now transpires that this supposed whistleblower is not an eyewitness or even an earwitness to the Trump-Zelensky conversation. So, rather than a whistleblower, or perhaps a dog whistle, this entire fandango — including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s just-announced impeachment inquiry — is fueled by merely an echo of a whistle. In other words, hearsay.

Conversely, Biden’s incriminating words were neither overheard nor just transcribed. In fact, he said this on camera at an on-the-record CFR meeting. Video tape exists of Biden boasting about securing the dismissal of the man who was probing his son’s possible graft.

So, apparently it’s a potentially impeachable offense for President Trump to raise Biden’s possible obstruction of justice in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which Kiev’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko called “long, friendly” and “no pressure.”

Meanwhile, it’s perfectly OK that the former vice president, as he personally crowed, blackmailed then-President Poroshenko into firing the top prosecutor who was investigating Hunter Biden’s possible graft.

Successfully sacking one’s son’s prosecutor via extortion: This is the textbook definition of obstruction of justice.

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN 'INTERFERENCE' IN ELECTION

However, when Americans learn how deeply involved Hunter Biden was in China and Ukraine while his father was vice president, they will see a scandal involving a lot of money which is easy to understand and easy to condemn.

The Biden-Ukraine money problem is not something new. Five years ago, on May 14, 2014, The Washington Post headline warned: “Hunter Biden’s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power.”

Vice President Biden’s intervention to protect his son, and his son’s company Burisma, from a Ukrainian corruption investigation, was heavy-handed and amazingly arrogant. And there is no question that Biden interfered. In his own words to the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, Biden clearly pushed to have the prosecutor who was investigating his son fired:

“I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from [former Ukrainian President] Poroshenko and from [former Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.

“So they said they had—they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to—or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said—I said, call him. (Laughter.) I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b*tch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

As Deroy Murdock, who is a member of the council, wrote for Fox News, “Biden’s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice.”

Now that the Hunter Biden corruption scandal is beginning to threaten his candidacy, Vice President Biden is trying to come up with a new story.

As Mark Thiessen wrote for The Washington Post and Fox News in his syndicated column on Tuesday, the former vice president is now claiming he never discussed his son’s business dealings overseas. As Thiessen points out, this claim is “flatly untrue.” Hunter Biden, has already told The New Yorker that Vice President Biden discussed the Ukraine business with his son, saying, “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’”

Again citing The New Yorker, Thiessen reported: “‘In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden. That same month, The New York Times published an article about how Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine undermined the vice president’s anti-corruption message, which quoted a Biden spokesman saying it had no impact.”

However, Ukraine is not the only site of scandalous self-enrichment by Hunter Biden. China is an even bigger center of money going to the former vice president’s son – money which would not have gone to him if his name had been Hunter Smith.

Peter Schweizer has become a remarkable researcher and writer about corruption. In a May, 11, 2019 New York Post article, he wrote extensively about the Bidens and China.

The investment firm Hunter Biden operated (along with former-Secretary of State John Kerry’s stepson Chris Heinz and their family friend and operative Devon Archer) in his dealings with China was Rosemont Seneca Partners, which formed in 2009.

By 2010, Hunter Biden and Archer “were in China meeting with top Chinese officials,” Schweizer wrote. By the way, Rosemont also partnered with the Thornton Group, which is led by James Bulger (the nephew of the infamous mobster James “Whitey” Bulger).

In 2013, Hunter Biden flew to China with his dad on Air Force Two. Within two weeks, Rosemont secured what eventually grew into a $1.5 billion private equity deal with a part of the Bank of China (which is owned by the Chinese Communist Party). So, as Schweizer put it, “the Chinese government-funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president.”

Interestingly, Schweizer wrote that the Thornton Group only touted its China meetings on its Chinese language website, saying “Chinese executives ‘extended their warm welcome’ to the ‘Thornton Group, with its US partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden (second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden).’ The purpose of the meetings was to ‘explore the possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity.’

One of these meetings between Hunter Biden’s company and Chinese officials happened on the same day Vice President Biden met with then-Chinese President Hu Jintao in Washington as part of the Nuclear Security Summit. And this was the rule rather than the exception.

Schweizer pointed out several more instances where Vice President Biden’s official business intersected with Hunter Biden’s private business. As he pointed out:

Twelve days after Hunter flew on Air Force Two to Beijing, Rosemont and the Bank of China entered “a first-of-its-kind investment fund” called Bohai Harvest RST (BHR).

In December 2014, the Chinese state-backed company Gemini Investments Limited made a $34 million investment into a fund managed by Rosemont.

In August 2014, Gemini Investments bought 75 percent of Rosemont Realty, a Rosemont Seneca sister company. The terms included a $3 billion commitment from the Chinese. The company then became Gemini Rosemont.

Finally, On April 16, 2014, Archer met with Vice President Biden at the White House. Five days later, Joe Biden met Ukrainian officials in Kiev about a United States Agency for International Development program to help the Ukrainian natural gas industry – including the promise of $1 billion in the U.S. and International Monetary Fund aid for Ukraine’s economy.

On April 22, 2014, Archer joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural-gas company.

On May 13, 2014, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board was announced. “Neither Hunter Biden nor Archer had any ground or experience in the energy sector.”

As Michael Kranish and David L. Stern wrote in The Washington Post on July 22, for more than 20 years, Hunter Biden’s professional career has followed his father’s political career, “from Washington to Ukraine to China.”

Speaker Pelosi has raised the correct standard that in America no one is above the law. However, the person who may be found guilty by that standard is former Vice President Biden.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER - BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

On Wednesday, Trump released a transcript of a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in which the two discussed investigating Biden over corruption allegations.

Biden, who has been the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, attracted scrutiny for pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, served on the board of directors.

Republicans have used the opportunity to turn the tables on Biden, claiming that the Ukraine controversy highlighted how Biden abused his power while in office.

Warren also seemed to benefit from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to impeach Trump, something Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday despite previous calls from Warren and others.

Pelosi resisted calls for impeachment surrounding the Russia investigation but seemed to face a tipping point after news surfaced about Trump's call with Zelensky. The speaker decried Trump's conduct while also accusing his administration of breaking the law by trying to suppress a whistleblower report on the president's comments.

He said the change showed growing support among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party for the president to be investigated.

Earlier this week, Trump called the Biden father and son ""corrupt"" and slammed media ""double standards"" over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden related to dealings with Kiev.

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”"

The litigation came a day after President Trump, seeking to turn the tables against Democrats as they pursue an impeachment inquiry, highlighted what he called Biden's own possible misconduct while in office.

“The latest assault on President Trump is an obvious attempt to protect Joe Biden from the corruption scandals involving his son,” Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement. “Judicial Watch’s latest lawsuit will be the first of many to try to get to the bottom of this influence-peddling scandal.”

Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where his son Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board reportedly paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise.

The former vice president specifically said he threatened to pull nearly $1 billion in Obama administration loan guarantees if Shokin wasn't fired, potentially crippling Ukraine's government.

Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while critics charged that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.

Judicial Watch said it was pursuing from the State Department ""any and all records regarding, concerning, or related to Viktor Shokin’s investigation of [former Ukrainian energy official] Mykola Zlochevsky and Shokin’s resignation at Ukraine’s Prosecutor General.""

Additionally, the organization sought ""any and all records of communication between any official, employee, or representative of the Department of State and any official, employee, or representative of the Office of the Vice President regarding Viktor Shokin.""

The lawsuit came only after the State Department refused to turn over the records after receiving a request in May, according to Judicial Watch.

The State Department has not ""produced the requested records or demonstrated that the requested records are lawfully exempt from production .... notified [Judicial Watch] of the scope of any responsive records it intends to produce or withhold and the reasons for any withholdings ... or informed [Judicial Watch] that it may appeal any adequately specific, adverse determination,"" Judicial Watch said in its complaint.

Following Trump's fiery remarks in New York on Wednesday, political scientist Ian Bremmer argued that Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine -- rather than Biden's decision to force out Ukraine's prosecutor -- was the real scandal.

""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" Bremmer wrote.

And Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who has long publicly pushed Ukraine to look into the Bidens, echoed the president's call for ""transparency"" from the Biden in a series of social media posts -- and directly accused Biden of corruption..

""We know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family,"" Giuliani wrote on Twitter. ""But $3 to $4m more was laundered to Biden. So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry’s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew.""

He added: ""Biden should agree to release records to see if he flew Hunter to China in Dec. 2013 on AF 2 to facilitate Hunter’s sale of his office to China for a total of $1.5 billion. Is there any doubt that China paid it to compromise VP. But they bought another pol as well. Guess?""

The call in question raises questions about whether or not Trump attempted to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family for possible corruption in exchange for U.S. aid and has been the catalyst for an official impeachment inquiry against Trump, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday.

""The 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it,"" Biden said in a statement.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT ACCURACY, AS DEMS THROW SHADE

During the July 25 phone call between the two presidents, Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.”

Trump's reference to Biden and his son relates to the former vice president's insistence that Ukraine fired its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

“Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me,” Trump said, according to the declassified transcript.

The 2020 Democratic presidential contender vowed that he would ""continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families.""

Biden also urged Congress to forge ahead with impeachment proceedings, saying ""Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable.""

Biden called the transcript, which isn't a verbate of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky but rather a summary of “notes and recollections"" from the conversation an ""abridged version that the White House was willing to issue to the public.""

""Congress is entitled to the full whistleblower complaint, and any and all other information about this matter,"" he added.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. who is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, set a Thursday deadline for the White House and State Department to turn over the related whistleblower complaint and other information related to the phone call but warned that the committee would issue a subpoena if the request wasn't fulfilled.

Trump additionally demanded ""transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president ... to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat. They threatened him if he didn't do things -- now that's what they're accusing me of, but I didn't do it.""

The aggressive move signaled that the White House would seek to turn the tables against Democrats who have initiated an impeachment inquiry, following the whistleblower's complaint that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden. Zelensky, speaking across from Trump just an hour earlier, told reporters he did not feel ""pushed"" at all in his conversations with the president.

WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED

Earlier in the day, the White House released a transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country. But the transcript also did not demonstrate that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in The Washington Post had claimed.

At the press conference, Trump specifically called attention to a little-discussed CNN report from May, which described how Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy pushed Ukraine’s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and, by Democrats' current logic, seemingly implied that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake.

""The Democrats have done what they're accusing me of doing,"" Trump said.

The Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Ukraine's leader at the time: ""In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building [democratic] institutions despite ongoing military, economic, and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump.""

The senators called for the top prosecutor to “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

The Post's Marc Thiessen initially flagged the letter on Tuesday, calling it evidence of a ""double standard"" among Democrats.

READ IT: THIESSEN CALLS OUT DEMS' DOUBLE STANDARD

""Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the president of Ukraine that if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress,"" Trump added.

That was a reference to the Connecticut Democrat's comments at a bipartisan meeting in Kiev earlier this month, when Murphy called U.S. aid the “most important asset” of Ukraine -- then issued a warning.

""I told Zelensky that he should not insert himself or his government into American politics,"" Murphy said, according to The Hill. ""I cautioned him that complying with the demands of the President's campaign representatives to investigate a political rival of the President would gravely damage the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. There are few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in Washington these days, and support for Ukraine is one of them.""

READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRUMP PHONE CALL

Responding to Trump's statements, Murphy said that ""in the meeting Republican Senator Ron Johnson and I had with President Zelensky three weeks ago, I made it clear to him that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election and that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign. I still believe this to be true.""

But in colorful language, Trump told reporters that the evidence clearly showed Democrats were disingenuously attacking him for political gain.

""We have the greatest economy we've ever had,"" The president said. ""When you see little [House Intelligence Committee Chair] Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic, smart guy by the way. ... Then he goes into a room with [House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry] Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off.""

""They must laugh their asses off."" — President Trump, referring to Democrats Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff

Not all Democrats in the House have been on board with impeachment. 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Wednesday that the Ukraine transcript did not present a ""compelling"" reason to impeach the president.

Taking the fight to the Democrats over the scores of Democrats who do support an impeachment inquiry could pay dividends for Republicans ahead of next year's elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Wednesday that its fundraising was up 608 percent after Democrats' impeachment push.

And the Trump reelection campaign and GOP announced they had raised a combined $5 million in just 24 hours.

Trump, accompanied by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, also slammed the media for focusing so heavily on a whistleblower's allegation that he improperly pressured Zelensky for political reasons.

WATCH: PELOSI ADMITS SHE HASN'T READ THE UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT

""We've made some fantastic deals, like with Japan, for farmers -- and that doesn't get covered, because you waste your time on nonsense,"" Trump said. ""It's very sad what Democrats are doing to this country -- they're dividing, they're demeaning.""

Pompeo and Mnuchin each discussed progress on trade, including the ongoing trade war with China, as well as Iran policy.

Trump's comments came shortly after he wrapped up a joint media appearance with Zelensky -- who flatly told reporters that he did not feel ""pushed"" to investigate Joe Biden.

“We had a great phone call,” Zelensky said earlier, as he sat across from Trump. “It was normal.”

Zelensky's comments did little to quiet a growing call among Democrats to press ahead with the impeachment inquiry announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Also on Wednesday, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire flatly contradicted another report in the Post, and maintained he never considered resigning over the matter.

""The Amazon Washington Post put out a fake article that [Maguire] was going to quit, blaming the White House for something they wouldn't let him talk openly about -- and I was shocked,"" Trump said at the presser.

The transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. The document begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before asking for a “favor” in the form of Ukraine providing information about the hacking of a Democratic National Committee (DNC) server in 2016 as part of apparent election interference efforts.

UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS NO EXPLICIT QUID PRO QUO

Trump referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Separately, the transcript shows, the president then pushed for a closer look at Biden's own dealings in Ukraine.

Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

Meanwhile, political scientist Ian Bremmer said the real scandal wasn't Biden's pressure to get rid of Shokin, but Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine.

Hunter Biden took a key position at Burisma shortly after Joe Biden visited Ukraine in 2014 and pushed officials there to greatly increase natural gas production. Hunter made tens of thousands of dollars a month but had no relevant credentials.

""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" Bremmer wrote.

""That’s a problem for the Vice President, but completely unrelated to Biden urging Ukraine President to fire his Special Prosecutor,"" Bremmer continued. ""[The prosecutor] was corrupt, refused to investigate anyone, and who Dems and GOP agreed needed to go.""

Trump said in the phone call with the Zelensky that he was focused primarily on the circumstances surrounding Shokin's termination.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call with the Zelensky. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

BIDEN UKRAINE DEALINGS: 7 ESSENTIAL FACTS

At the presser, Trump broadened the scope of his concerns to the Biden's business dealings generally, and said that he was reluctant to release the transcript because he was concerned about setting the ""precedent"" of releasing private calls with foreign leaders to ""the fake news media.""

""But you folks were saying such lies about a call that was so innocent and so nice,"" Trump said, that he felt compelled to act.

On Wednesday, just prior to his press conference, Trump tweeted that he had told Republicans he supported a closer look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine.

""I have informed @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy and all Republicans in the House that I fully support transparency on so-called whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter, on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China,"" Trump wrote.

""Additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat,"" he added.

Bipartisan efforts are underway for the whistleblower to testify before Congress.

The Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News –pushed back Wednesday on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress.

The letter also said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call.

Sources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation.

Newsmax CEO and Trump confidant Chris Ruddy expressed his skepticism on Tuesday night about the hype surrounding the allegations being made about Trump and his communications with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""You thought that the Mueller thing should be investigated, the collusion thing- that took two years, $50 million,"" Ruddy told ""CNN Tonight"" anchor Don Lemon. ""I could tell you 12 headlines from CNN and other media that never came out to be true. And at the end of the day, there was no collusion.""

""It never said, 'no collusion,'"" Lemon asserted.

""It was very definitive, but my point is we are now three days into this and we already have an impeachment process underway,"" Ruddy continued. ""If the president committed a crime, I believe he should be impeached, but there's no evidence here yet that he committed any crime and I don't believe he did.""

SCARAMUCCI DECLARES TRUMP IS 'DONE' AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY TAKES FORM: 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME NOW'

The Trump ally repeatedly pressed Lemon on what crimes Trump allegedly violated, something the CNN anchor couldn't answer.

""Even if he was saying, 'I want an investigation of what happened in the 2016 election where they were clearly interfering, the Ukrainians, in that American election... and an investigation of Joe Biden was also a role, what is illegal about that?"" Ruddy asked. ""It may be totally inappropriate... so you're now on the basis of hearsay or a discussion on this we're already under an impeachment process... what federal law has he violated?""

MSNBC'S NICOLLE WALLACE: I DON'T REMEMBER REPUBLICANS WHO SUPPORT TRUMP AS 'GOOD PEOPLE ANYMORE

Ruddy later pivoted to knock CNN's coverage of the Ukraine scandal.

""The Democrats in Washington are talking about impeaching [Trump] on basically hearsay... for the very thing Joe Biden did- he was trying to push out a prosecutor. You don't show that clip anytime,"" Ruddy told Lemon in reference to the 2018 video of Biden bragging about his involvement in pushing out a Ukrainian prosecutor by threatening to withhold foreign aid.""

""We're not here to talk about Joe Biden,"" Lemon responded, ""because none of that has been-""

""You don't want to talk about anything that's a counternarrative,"" Ruddy shot back.

The Newsmax CEO went on to suggest that the impeachment movement is occurring because people were ""unhappy"" with the results of the 2016 election, something Lemon rejected by saying ""that is a feeling, not a fact.""

""Even though the polling is showing that not the majority of the American people are not necessarily on the side of impeachment, you don't think that it is a good thing that lawmakers are doing what is right rather than doing what the polls are showing?"" Lemon asked. ""Because a lot of people who want this impeachment inquiry to happen are in Trump districts and may not get the votes that they want next time.""

""I think there's been a constant drumbeat like your coverage- CNN, not you personally,"" Ruddy responded. ""All night long, I didn't see really anyone that was supportive of the president's position. I may be the first person on all night.""

""No, there have been other people. You didn't see them,"" Lemon reacted.

""They're very rare and they're exceptions to the narrative,"" Ruddy continued. ""I think the American people are seeing it. They're ultimately going to be the judge of the impeachment process."""

""This is a White House that has falsified information before -- from showing a doctored hurricane map to promoting a video that an outside group altered of a CNN reporter. So who knows if this transcript will actually be complete?"" Tapper asked. He also noted that complaints surrounding Trump involved more than just the phone call.

Tapper's comments came just before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced a formal impeachment inquiry. Pelosi said ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.

""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law.""

Trump, on Tuesday, denied any wrongdoing and offered to release the transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

He also blasted Pelosi's decision to pursue impeachment since she ""never even saw the transcript.""

Trump has denied pressuring Zelensky, something Ukraine's foreign minister seemed to corroborate on Saturday. The president also disputed speculation that he tried to extort an investigation out of Ukraine by withholding foreign aid.

Trump announced later on Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo received permission to release the transcript. ""Secretary of State Pompeo received permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don’t know either what the big deal is.

The video surfaced after Biden appeared to offer support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision, announced on Tuesday, to open a formal impeachment inquiry on President Trump.

NANCY PELOSI ON BILL CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT IN 1998: 'REPUBLICANS ARE PARALYZED WITH HATRED'

""Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,"" he said in a statement released by his campaign. Biden's statement specifically called out the administration for suppressing the whistleblower report cited by Pelosi, D-Calif., in Tuesday's announcement.

According to Pelosi, the administration violated U.S. law when the Director of National Intelligence blocked an unnamed whistleblower from speaking out on Trump's comments to Ukrainian leadership. The administration has denied any wrongdoing and claimed whistleblower statutes didn't apply to that particular report.

The specter of impeachment has naturally conjured media comparisons to Clinton's administration-- the last time the House of Representatives impeached a sitting president. The House famously impeached Clinton, accusing him of committing perjury, among other things, when he lied under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky,

Biden, at the time, defended the president, suggesting that an impeachment inquiry might subvert the will of the American people.

“This is their president we are talking about,"" Biden said. ""The President of the United States does not serve at the pleasure of the legislature, does not serve at the pleasure of Joe Biden, does not serve at the pleasure of Henry Hyde, does not serve at the pleasure of the Congress, as a prime minister does in a parliamentary system.""

""He is elected directly by the people of the United States of America, and the election of a president is the only nationwide vote the American people will ever cast and that’s a big deal.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT ACCURACY, AS DEMS THROW SHADE

The issue could become even more complicated for Biden, now the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, as the Ukraine controversy centered on Trump seeking an investigation into corruption allegations surrounding the former vice president.

Republicans and the president have responded to Democratic attacks by framing impeachment as another attack in their relentless war to remove Trump from office. Their rhetoric bore a resemblance to Biden's in that the party has accused Democratic leadership of trying to undermine the 2016 election results.

""There's been a double standard from Democrats since day one with this president,' said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. ""They have refused to accept the results of the election, boycotting the inauguration, the 2-year Russia hoax where the president was clearly exonerated, no collusion, no obstruction. And now this, where they rush to judgment in a knee-jerk way to bring impeachment proceedings when they haven't even read the transcript or heard from the inspector general.""

Pelosi, in 1998, also described Republicans as ""paralyzed with hatred"" as they pursued impeachment against Clinton.

“Today the Republican majority is not judging the president with fairness, but impeaching him with a vengeance,"" then-House Minority Leader Pelosi declared on the House floor in December 1998.

She continued, ""In the investigation of the president, fundamental principles which Americans hold dear -- fairness, privacy, checks, and balances -- have been seriously violated and why?

The former New York City mayor accused the FBI of trying to stifle the investigation into possible collusion because of biased political considerations.

""I thought these people were just mistaken at first. I didn't realize until I got deeply into this, they created this whole Russian collusion allegation,"" he said in the interview.

""Part of the place it was created is in Ukraine. And [do] you want to know why I started investigating Ukraine back in November of last year?

Giuliani also commented on House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump and said their efforts are a sideshow. He called on Biden to release all records from his time in the executive branch.

""[Democrats will] find something wrong [with Trump]. He pronounced [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky's name wrong, therefore he should be impeached,"" he said. ""Don't you realize this is a complete sham? It's a joke?... I think Joe Biden should release all his records as vice president.""

Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats for allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and using military aid as leverage. The president has denied any wrongdoing.

“The president must be held accountable,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday, citing Trump's alleged “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”

Pelosi and Democrats also allege that the administration violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump’s July call.

The president also knocked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., claiming she is ""no longer the speaker"" as far as he's concerned after she formally launched an impeachment inquiry, which was demanded among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.

Trump's efforts to solicit information on Biden appears to fall squarely into that category, and though sitting presidents cannot be charged with a criminal offense they can be impeached by Congress.

Hunter Biden was discovered to have ties to the Ukranian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which paid him $50,000 a month while it was under investigation for corruption. Media scrutiny of the connection intensified after President Trump was accused of committing an impeachable offense by asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden.

""The larger issue here... is, why is it that Hunter Biden was allowed to get involved with a company that is as dirty and as crooked as Burisma?"" Schweizer asked.

""[Ukraine] is one of those countries that has been saddled with corruption, really since the fall of Communism -- even during the Communist period.

A whistleblower complaint released Thursday alleged that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room,"" the complaint says.

TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday the formalization of an impeachment inquiry and specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the president is accused of pressing the foreign leader to ratchet up an inquiry into presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Rove not only argued that impeachment would put Biden's Ukraine roll into question but also bring other issues to the surface,

On the roster: Biden hits the skids in new Q Poll - Trump leaned on Ukrainian leader for Biden dirt - Audible: Excuses, excuses! - Happy hump day



BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS

New Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]

Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.



[Ed. note: I can’t go so far as to say that I felt “bad” for the Cubs, but I can say that I admire your determination, Mr. Tock. And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball. And with three games left against the Cards, I’m sure your squad will try hard to avenge the Wrigley sweep!]

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”

""Where are we coming in as a nation when both Republicans and Democrats see an ally, Ukraine, under attack and a president of the United States withholds that aid in order to go after a political opponent? I think that was a bridge too far for people,"" he said.

Host Steve Doocy asked about the double standard regarding Biden and Ukraine after it was discovered the former vice president's son, Hunter, had ties to a Ukranian natural gas firm that was under investigation for corruption and paid him $50,000 a month. Booker refused to address the question directly and said Trump's actions were more severe.

""It's like saying, here's a firecracker over here. Pay no attention to the nuclear bomb going off,"" Booker replied. ""A president of the United States of America, in order to pursue his own personal benefit, withholds aid from an ally under attack.""

Doocy continued to press Booker on Biden's possible corruption, but the New Jersey Democrat stood firm and kept the focus on Trump.

""The president of the United States should withhold bipartisan-approved aid that is life or death? I've been to the... region. I've seen the violence,"" he said, claiming there is ""no evidence whatsoever"" of wrongdoing by Biden after the issue was investigated.

Booker also said Congress is only using the threat of impeachment of President Trump as ""leverage"" to force the White House to release the transcript of Trump's call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky after it was alleged he pressured him to investigate Biden by withholding federal funding.

""We need the leverage, through an impeachment inquiry, to be able to better get to the truth,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""When they started with [Richard] Nixon they didn't know the truth yet. The public was mostly on the side of Nixon until the truth started coming out."""

“Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.

The comments come after the White House released a transcript reflecting that call. It showed Trump sought a probe into Biden family dealings in the country, though it did not show Trump explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid, as some have suggested.

“We had a great phone call,” Zelensky added. “It was normal.”

Trump interjected afterward: “In other words, there was no pressure and you know there was no pressure.”

Trump’s meeting with Zelensky comes just hours after the White House released the transcript of their summertime call and less than a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she was opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the issue.

“She’s lost her way, she’s been taken over by the radical left,” Trump said of Pelosi.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree had already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act.

Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

But Democrats also slammed the president for seeking the Biden-related probe in Ukraine in the first place.

“This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Wednesday.

Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- millions of dollars of which had been frozen days earlier.

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyberfirm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

The White House and Trump allies have adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.”

But Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo.

Schiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always ""reciprocal,"" a comment he made after noting how ""very very good"" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making his requests regarding Biden.

“There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff said.

But if we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are others who have some explaining to do.

It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as ""strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,"" the Democratic senators declared, ""We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,"" before demanding Lutsenko ""reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.""

So, it's okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it's not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.

According to The New York Times, ""Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden ... who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general."" The Post reported it is ""unclear how seriously Shokin — who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall — was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out.""

What is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: ""I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a b----. He got fired.""

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

This weekend, Biden told reporters, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.'"" Moreover, the New Yorker reported, ""In December 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration's special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden.""

So, Biden was fully aware of his son's involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor's dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, ""It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president."" Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden's conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.

Put aside the prosecutor's firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.

And the focus will not just be on Ukraine. It will also be on how, as The Post reported, ""for more than two decades, [Hunter's] professional work often tracked with his father's life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China.""

While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats' investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

EXCLUSIVE: Official says watchdog found whistleblower had 'political bias' against Trump

""We know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family,” he tweeted. ""But $3 to $4m more was laundered to Biden. So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry’s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew.""

Giuliani was referring to Joe Biden’s son Hunter; Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry; and James Bulger, the nephew of notorious mobster Whitey Bulger.

The Washington Examiner reported this week that Hunter Biden's decision to join the board of the Ukrainian firm, Burisma Holdings, back in 2014, was enough to make Heinz, his business partner, raise questions with the State Department and later severed ties with the Biden.

The New Yorker recently ran an extensive article about Hunter Biden and mentioned several instances where he could have been perceived as using his father's position to help his career. In 2013, Hunter Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force 2 before he secured a $1.5 billion deal from a subsidiary of the Bank of China.

“You want to know why the secretary of state (Kerry) wasn't particularly upset about it? Because his son was getting money too. Isn't it a coincidence that China sends $1.5 billion to a private equity fund? There were only three owners: Biden’s son, Kerry's son, and Whitey Bulger’s nephew,” Giuliani told the Examiner.

Giuliani's tweets came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump focused partly on whether he abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government to undermine Joe Biden and help his own reelection.

In a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump is accused of asking for help investigating the Bidens. In the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine — prompting speculation that he was holding out the money as leverage for information on the Bidens. Trump has denied that charge, but acknowledged he blocked the funds, later released.

Biden said Tuesday, before Pelosi’s announcement, that if Trump doesn’t cooperate with lawmakers’ demands for documents and testimony in its investigations the president “will leave Congress ... with no choice but to initiate impeachment.”

""If the answer is yes, I’ll be on your show very disappointed with our president. If the answer is no, this is Russia times two, times 10,"" he said.

Graham said he also wanted to know how the whistleblower found out about the conversation and if they had any bias for writing their complaint.

“Was there a reason to withhold aid to this new Ukrainian administration until we knew who they were? Was it okay for President Trump to withhold money to try to get other countries to give more?” he added.

He told Hannity the reason Democrats are trying to impeach Trump is because they don’t believe they can beat him in 2020.

“If there’s no evidence that President Trump tried to coerce the Ukrainians into investigating Biden … then there’s nothing here,” he added.

Graham extended an offer to the whistleblower to testify before Congress.

Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry Tuesday following the whistleblower's complaint that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden.

The Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday voted by unanimous consent for a resolution calling on the Trump administration to release to the Senate Intelligence Committee the whistleblower’s complaint. The Intelligence Committee has opened a bipartisan investigation into the complaint, and it was reported that the whistleblower may appear before the committee to give closed-door testimony.

The whisteblower’s legal counsel, Compass Rose Legal Group, confirmed in the statement that it wrote to the acting DNI for security guidance to permit the meeting if needed.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D.-Calif., responded to Compass Rose on Tuesday, requesting an interview with the whistleblower. ""In light of your notice of intent to the acting director of national intelligence, the committee requests a voluntary interview with your client on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019, in the afternoon, following the public testimony of acting Director Maguire before the committee. The committee is prepared to work with you to identify a secure location and format that preserves your client's privacy and ensure protection from reprisal or threat of reprisal,"" said Schiff.

Schiff also said the committee expects the acting DNI, in light of the legal counsel's letter to him, to cease withholding the complaint and provide the whistleblower with guidance as to how to communicate with his committee directly.

Maguire, as of Monday, was refusing to share details of the complaint with lawmakers. As a prelude to ratcheting up an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that unless Maguire provided information about the whistleblower complaint to Congress, administration officials would ""be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.”

In a letter last week, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote the agency is protecting the whistleblower and said the allegation is not an “urgent concern” and did not relate to ‘intelligence activity’ under the DNI’s supervision.

The whistleblower has alleged that President Trump ordered his staff to freeze $400 million in aid to Ukraine days before a July phone call with President Zelensky. Trump told Zelensky he would not release the aid money until Zelenksy investigated Biden and his son Hunter’s ties to a Ukrainian firm some allege was looking to influence the Obama administration through the Bidens.

The Democrat from New Jersey also termed “the revelations” from the whistleblower in the Ukraine controversy “explosive.”

BOOKER DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S UKRAINE TIES

But Booker emphasized that even though “we are in a constitutionally challenging moment” with an impeachment inquiry in Congress underway, he didn’t believe the White House race would become all about the Trump presidency.

Booker spoke with reporters following a campaign event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire soon after an unclassified version of the complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower was released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning.

The unidentified whistleblower claimed that White House officials who listened to the call in July between the president and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's requests that Zelensky investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

The president on Thursday called the whistleblower report “another fake news story” and “another witch hunt” by the Democrats.

Booker claimed that the president was using “the highest office in the land.. for his own personal political agenda” and emphasized that “we are seeing evidence of that in this whistleblower report.”

And he spotlighted that “clearly there's more work to be done. There needs to be a thorough investigation.”

An optimistic Booker predicted that the Republican-controlled Senate “will investigate as well…there’s already been shown some good bipartisan efforts to get to the truth.”

Slamming congressional Democrats, Trump on Thursday charged “they’re going to tie up our country. We can’t talk about gun regulation. We can’t talk about anything. Frankly they’re so tied up. They so screwed up. Nothing gets done.”

But Booker – while acknowledging that “there’s gonna be a lot of wind sucked off the sails” – added, “do not underestimate the ability for us to get things done in Washington when…we start to build relationships to get things done.”

Booker, emphasizing that the presidential election needed to be more than just about Trump, told Fox News “Americans are far more sophisticated… the United States is in peril, because of corruption. But we can also deal with other issues.”

The rough transcript of the call based on notes, released Wednesday morning, shows Trump pushing for Ukraine to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

That refers to Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where his son Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, given that Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

On Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky — a detail that fueled calls for impeachment proceedings. But the transcript does not include any mention of the aid, as a bargaining chip or otherwise.

Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, “I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.”

But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, “no.”

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT IN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: “I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.”

The ""details"" to which Warren was referring are from the two ethics plans she's unveiled to tackle corruption in government. Her campaign later clarified to the Washington Post that the plans wouldn't prevent any child of a vice president from serving on such a board.

Warren’s comments came hours after the White House released a transcript of Trump’s call from this past July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The readout showed that the president asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Biden family’s dealings with Ukraine. However, the transcript did not suggest Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine to obtain a “promise” of an investigation.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

TRUMP TRIES TO TURN TABLES ON DEMOCRATS IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

Trump on Wednesday emphasized that there was no quid pro quo during his call with the Ukrainian president, saying, “I didn’t do it.” Trump spoke with reporters one day after House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment inquiry. They’re investigating whether the Republican president broke the law by allegedly asking a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 election by asking for Ukraine’s assistance in investigating the Bidens.

Warren kicked off her event – in front of a crowd estimated at 900 people by her campaign – by emphasizing, “nobody’s above the law... not even the president.” And, she repeated her call that “it is time for impeachment now.”

The Massachusetts senator was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call for Trump’s impeachment. She did it this past spring, citing findings from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report.

Asked if she had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would take action if the House impeached Trump, Warren told reporters, “I don’t know what the Senate will do under (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnel’s control, but right now we have to do what is right regardless of the politics.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

She continued, “Donald Trump had established he believed that he was above the law, and that’s what the Mueller report shows, that he obstructed justice, and he was not held accountable by our Congress. So, he came back in the summer and did it again, inviting a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election.”

Warren’s stop in New Hampshire came a day after a new poll indicated that she held a slight two-point advantage over Biden in the crucial primary state.

Reacting on ""America's Newsroom"" to the release of the transcript of the call, which is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those who heard the conversation, Baier said Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden appears to have been made right after Zelensky mentioned the planned purchase of Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States.

“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,"" Trump said, according to the transcript.

Baier noted that House Democrats have not moved forward to a vote on impeachment, but many on the left will likely argue that a quid pro quo is ""implied"" by the president in the conversation.

""They will say that that conversation that preceded it is implied. Is that going to be the moment that gets a vote on an impeachment article? Obviously Nancy Pelosi doesn't think so yet. She hasn't moved to vote to authorize an inquiry,"" he said.

In the days before the call, Trump reportedly ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, a detail that fueled impeachment calls leading to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. Democrats have argued Trump may have been using the military aid as leverage to push Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings, though the White House has denied that.

“At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019,” Maguire said in a statement. “I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”

The Post report, which cited ""current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter,"" said that Maguire had threatened to turn in his resignation over concerns that the White House might try to make him stonewall Congress. He is set to testify Thursday about a whistleblower complaint that has spurred House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

The White House has also denied that Maguire threatened to resign, with Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham complaining on Twitter that the Post had only given them six minutes to respond to their request for comment.

“This is actually not true,” Grisham said of the newspaper’s story. “And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.”

The account of Maguire’s resignation threat is another subplot in the furor enveloping Washington in the aftermath of revelations concerning the unnamed whistleblower’s complaint.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing Trump broached a review of dealings in the Eastern European country involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

Joe Biden has stated that while vice president, he urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Shokin had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

The transcript, though, did not show Trump explicitly linking the request to $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which at the time was on hold.

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

In the fundraising email, the Trump campaign calls the impeachment inquiry a “witch hunt” – a term frequently used by the president during the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election – and announces his campaign’s “Impeachment Defense Task Force.” The email does not go into details about what the task force will do or who will head it up.

“The Democrats’ constant personal attacks, vicious lies, and now these baseless impeachment attacks, have never had anything to do with me,” the email from the Trump campaign said. “This is only the beginning of yet ANOTHER nasty Witch Hunt against me, and we need to fight back BIGGER and STRONGER than ever before.”

The Trump campaign's manager, Brad Parscale, released a separate statement Wednesday saying, ""The facts prove the President did nothing wrong. This is just another hoax from Democrats and the media, contributing to the landslide re-election of President Trump in 2020.”

In her remarks Tuesday, Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.

On the call with the newly elected Ukrainian president, Trump allegedly pushed him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

“This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said.

The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, seeking an investigation of some kind.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.

But Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo, saying Wednesday it is clear what the president was after.

Schiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always ""reciprocal,"" a comment he made after noting how ""very very good"" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making certain requests.

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

On Wednesday, Schiff said all these details “are far more damning than I and others had imagined.”

“This is the Ukrainian president who is desperate for military support…[Trump] tells him he has a favor to ask,” he said.

Schiff added: “[Trump] communicates that the U.S. has done a lot for Ukraine, but there is not much reciprocity. This is how a mafia boss talks. 'What have you done for us? I have a favor I want to ask you.'”

“Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. To investigate the Bidens,” Schiff said, adding that another “layer” of misconduct was Trump’s attempt to use Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as “emissaries” who would be “part and parcel in this.”

UKRAINE CALL WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWED 'POLITICAL BIAS,' FAVORED TRUMP'S 'RIVAL' CANDIDATE: MEMO

“The fact that the president would invoke the attorney general sends a further message to Ukraine—this is not just me asking, this is not just Giuliani asking, but this is the United States government,” Schiff said.

The transcript shows Trump saying he wanted the Ukrainian president to speak with both Barr and Giuliani.

“There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff continued. “Ukraine understood what this president wanted. He had his emissaries making it clear, and Ukraine knew what it needed to do if it wanted to get military assistance.”

Schiff and other top committee chairs later released a statement saying: ""Let’s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections—that is betrayal enough."" The chairmen added that they will subpoena the White House and State Department for a related whistleblower complaint and other information, should they miss a Thursday deadline to turn it over.

This stance suggests Democrats will charge ahead on their impeachment inquiry, ""quid pro quo"" or not.

Schiff is likely to be a key figure in the process, as Pelosi's Tuesday decision takes all Trump-focused investigations from six prominent House committees and puts them all “under one umbrella,” according to a Democratic source.

Pelosi, on Wednesday, also stood by the need for impeachment.

“The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,” she said in a statement. “Clearly, the Congress must act.”

Biden himself also said in a statement that the document “makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent.”

But the White House and Trump allies adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory.

White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.”

House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., also said there was no quid pro quo, and said the Democrats “leapt to conclusions before looking at the facts.”

“The real danger here is that Democrats keep using baseless accusations in hopes of crippling a successful presidency,” Collins said in a statement Wednesday.

While the transcript does show Trump asking Zelensky to probe Biden, it does not show Trump explicitly linking U.S. aid to Ukraine. Administration officials told Fox News on Tuesday that, at the time, U.S. aid to Ukraine was frozen, but claimed that it was over corruption concerns and other countries not paying their fair share.

Meanwhile, Democrats are moving on other fronts as well.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has called for Barr to step aside from any review of the matter.

“The President dragged the Attorney General into this mess,” Nadler tweeted. “At a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter.”

The Justice Department, though, has denied involvement in any potential investigations into Biden or anything else.

“The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine—on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine—on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter, or anything related to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

Meanwhile, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., questioned why Giuliani was involved in the first place.

“What role does Rudolph Giuliani have in this government?” he asked during a House Democratic press conference Wednesday. “Is he in the Department of Justice? Is he the secretary of state? Is he an ambassador to Ukraine or to the European Union?”

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

“Rudolph Giuliani is the president’s political hit man,” he continued. “And in an official conversation with the president of Ukraine, he directed the Ukrainian president to have a follow up conversation with Giuliani as part of the effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.”

The Washington Post on Wednesday reported that Giuliani has been involved in pursuing a ""shadow agenda"" with Ukraine—an allegation the former New York City mayor has denied, calling it “complete nonsense.”

He tweeted Wednesday: ""The transcript really shows how dishonest news media is. Unlike Joe Biden, no military aid was withheld, no threats, and absolutely no pressure. Zelensky introduces me into the conversation, not POTUS Trump.""

Appearing on “America’s Newsroom” with co-hosts Bill Hemmer and Sandra Smith, Brazile also said she found Trump's call for Zelenskiy to “look into” Democratic rival Joe Biden by working with Attorney General William Barr and the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, extremely “troubling.”

As for what should happen, Brazile said Congress -- especially the House -- should “act accordingly, look at the facts, bring in the whistleblower, bring in more transcripts.”

“Let us get to the bottom of it,” she exclaimed.

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter or Joe, a frontrunner to be Trump's Democratic rival in the 2020 election.

The White House’s release of the transcript came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., formally announced an impeachment probe into the president.

The Ukraine call is one part of a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's actions.

“Well, I’m not an investigator. Nor am I a lawyer. I would hope that the White House turn over the whistleblower. They never should have stopped this complaint from going directly to Congress,” Brazile said. “I put this above my partisanship. I put this right where it should go, which is the protection of our democracy.”

WHISTLEBLOWER HAD INDICATIONS OF BIAS, SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS

On Wednesday morning, the president met with world leaders at the United Nations, including Zelenskiy.

In an appearance before reporters, Zelenskiy said he did not want to get involved in an American election, but added, “Nobody pushed me.”

In the days before the controversial July phone call, Trump instructed his advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine. However, the aid package was not mentioned in the call.

In a statement on Wednesday, Joe Biden said it was “tragedy” that the president was willing to “put personal politics above his sacred oath.”

“We also learned that he planned to involve the United States Department of Justice in this scheme -- a direct attack on the core independence of that department, an independence essential to the rule of law,” he said.

“This is about the protection of our country,” Brazile said. “What has he learned over the last three years? What is he doing now to protect us from any foreign meddling in our current election season?”

She told Hemmer and Smith: “Joe Biden has answered these questions. The fact is that many people do not wish to hear the answer. … And yes, if some of the other Democrats would like to take this up, take it up. But for now, the president of the United States … needs to answer why he called upon the president of a foreign country to interfere and look into our election.”"

The Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel on Wednesday morning released an opinion on the whistleblower’s complaint, which had claimed to report a matter of “urgent concern.” The OLC determined that the complaint, though, “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” and does not require that the director of national intelligence “transmit the complaint to the intelligence committees.”

UKRAINE CALL MEMO SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, BUT DID NOT MENTION AID

This determination is at the heart of a disagreement that has pitted the DOJ and intelligence director against the inspector general and congressional Democrats. The latter maintain that the complaint should be turned over to Congress. Such a step is being considered, though the White House released a rough transcript Wednesday morning showing Trump indeed pressed Ukraine to look into Biden family dealings, as had been alleged. But Trump, in the transcript, did not explicitly tie the request to military aid.

Included in the OLC opinion, though, was a section that revealed the whistleblower showed indications of a “political bias” -- as Fox News first reported Tuesday -- while saying that the inspector general still believed the allegations were credible.

“Although the ICIG’s preliminary review found ‘some indica of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,’ the ICIG concluded that the complaint’s allegations nonetheless appeared credible,” the opinion said.

The name of the rival candidate was not revealed in the opinion. Fox News previously reported that the whistleblower also did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to sources.

The OLC opinion came in conjunction with the released transcript of the president’s call with Zelensky. The whistleblower complaint alleged that unnamed “White House officials” had “expressed concern about the content of a telephone call between the President and a foreign leader.”

READ UKRAINE CALL MEMO

According to the ICIG, “statements made by the president during the call could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of campaign-finance laws.”

The DOJ has not reached such a determination.

The transcript, declassified by Trump, indicates the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. It begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually broaches the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

That refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, as Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

On Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky, a detail that fueled impeachment calls leading to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. But the call transcript does not show Trump mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip or otherwise.

The transcript shows Zelensky suggesting to Trump the Biden matter would be looked into by a new prosecutor. “He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,"" he said. ""The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.”

The release of the transcript and of the opinion from the OLC come after Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, answering mounting calls from her caucus to make the process official.

Democrats are seeking the whistleblower’s complaint in a full and unredacted format. The DNI general counsel said, though, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress.

The White House on Wednesday released a document detailing the president’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, showing he indeed sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country, though did not explicitly tie the request to U.S. aid.

UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER – BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

But with virtually every aspect of this controversy being disputed, even the format of the document was challenged. The concerns focused on a notation on the document saying it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call.

This detail was seized upon by critics to challenge its accuracy, though the administration maintained the document is reliable.

""Trump committed a crime. The White House just gave us proof of a crime. But we think there's more,"" a Democratic aide told Fox News. ""The question is, what are they hiding? This wasn't a full transcript, so how bad is this whole thing?""

New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “what they are calling a ‘transcript’ isn’t even a transcript. It’s a collection of notes.”

“This is what they are *admitting* to and it’s way above and beyond what is necessary for impeachment,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Journalists also pushed back against it: “We have to refrain from calling it a verbatim transcript,” tweeted Brian Karem, the Playboy writer and CNN contributor.

However, the Trump administration is defending the accuracy of the document.

A senior Department of Justice official told Fox News that DOJ officials interviewed knowledgeable people about the process for creating the transcript and are confident the document is accurate.

Fox News has learned it reflects the standard process for documenting calls with foreign leaders. It is essentially a compilation of what two Situation Room officers wrote down while listening in on the call in real time. A source familiar with the White House Situation Room staff confirmed that the two transcribers who listened in on Trump’s call are CIA employees detailed to the White House from the agency.

What the White House is calling a “transcript” is as close to a verbatim readout of this call as exists.

An audio recording of the call itself does not exist, as the policy of the Situation Room is that head of state calls are not typically recorded.

The document, declassified by Trump on Tuesday as Democrats are pressing forward with impeachment, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call, according to the rough transcript. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

For example, remember the latest New York Times hit piece on Brett Kavanaugh? The one where they found a brand new accusation of sexual misconduct, but then later had to admit it was all a sham? When did that happen? It feels like about a year ago, but actually, no, it was just last week.

That's the Trump-era news cycle for you. Scandals that used to go on for months now seem to end in hours. Nothing illustrates that better than this bizarre Ukraine story that we're all living through.

NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMS FEAR BLOWBACK FROM IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: REPORT

So, a week ago, no one had even heard of it. By Tuesday night, we were on the brink of impeachment because of it. And now, it seems to be over already.

Just to bring you back and remind you what just happened: the same angry news anchors who brought you Stormy Daniels and the Russia hoax now wanted you to know that Big Orange's days in the White House were finally over.

Why? Because Trump, they said, threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine. And it's essential that we send military aid to Ukraine for some reason. But Trump was going to withhold it unless they did something bad to Joe Biden and his family.

Basically, it was an extortion plot against Ukraine, and that's a crime, the news anchors shouted. A crime! Trump was finished!

Well, Wednesday morning, they turned out to be wrong. Actual evidence emerged. And it contradicted what they told us yesterday. The administration released a transcript of the president's phone call with Ukrainian head of state, and it shows none of the things that news anchors claimed it would show. Read it for yourself, don't trust us. It's right online.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Try to find the extortion in there; there isn't any. Trump never even mentions military aid. Well, yes, they're saying now, but he asked a foreign government to investigate an American citizen and that is immoral.

OK. Was it immoral when three Democratic senators wrote a letter to Ukraine just last year, demanding investigations into Trump? No answer on that question. Well, we will tell you if we hear back.

Instead, now they're telling us that the transcript of the phone call can't be real. It must be doctored. Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff spun their conspiracy theory on Tuesday night.

Chris Hayes, MSNBC host: Do you trust the White House enough to take that transcript and believe that that is an actual representation of what transpired?

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: Well, you know, I think, sadly, it is the case as you described that we cannot trust the administration with respect to anything that it produces.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.: Simply to release the transcript is not going to come close to ending the need of the American public and the Congress to see what actually happened.

So again, that was last night, before the transcript was publicly available. Now that it is publicly available for Adam Schiff's conspiracy addled brain, it has lurched in a different direction. Now he is telling us that the transcript, the one that he has already denounced as fake, is, in fact, real. But it doesn't show what it should show -- which is to say it doesn't show President Trump doing any of the things that supposedly justify impeachment. Why?

Well, Adam Schiff explains because the president, like a Navajo code talker, is speaking in secret code.

If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's alleged corruption. That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really.

""This is how a mafia boss talks,"" Schiff told reporters. ""What have you done for us? We've done so much for you. But there's not much reciprocity. I have a favor I want to ask you. And what is that favor? Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. A classic mafia-like shakedown a foreign leader.""

So, you know, we're not psychiatrists here. But honestly, Adam Schiff is a nut case. It's true. It's hard to believe he is in Congress. Poor people of Anaheim, or wherever he is from -- Southern California, the Valley somewhere. It's hard to believe he is actually in Congress.

He is actually a committee chairman, believe it or not. Too bad the 25th Amendment doesn't apply to members of Congress.

But to be fair, most Democrats are not anywhere near as crazy as Adam Schiff, not even the same ballpark. They're just very cynical -- extremely cynical -- more cynical you've ever thought of being.

For example, this is illustrated when Congressman Al Green, who is not stupid or crazy, explains what's actually driving impeachment against Trump.

Interviewer: Are you concerned that impeachment talk may actually help the president's reelection?

Rep. Al Green, D-Texas: I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected.

""I'm concerned if we don't impeach, he will get reelected."" I'm concerned that democracy could happen. We've got to stop that.

It's about power. Duh. You knew that. That's what it's always about, power.

Nobody pushing for impeachment actually cares about secret deals with foreign leaders. Oh, please. Much less justice or the truth. Again, these are the most cynical people in the United States of America.

What they care about -- and you knew this already -- was winning the 2020 presidential election. That's all they care about. Getting their mitts on the levers of power and exercising power for its own sake. That's what drives them. That's why they get up in the morning.

Democratic leaders have decided that impeaching Trump is essential if they're going to win next year. So they're staking everything on this bizarre, flimsy scandal that the rest of us can barely even understand. Will it work? Probably not.

If personal attacks on Trump are effective -- if calling him a racist or a traitor actually worked -- then Hillary Clinton would be running for reelection right about now. That is not going to work. It never works.

If you want to impeach Trump, make a case on the issues. He won on the issues. Make a counter case. The geniuses can't figure that out.

In the end, the real loser here in this impeachment nonsense is likely to be Joe Biden. Biden, you'll recall, is the frontrunner, supposedly. He is supposed to be the safe choice, the guy who is going to energize the Obama coalition and win back the White House.

And yet now Democrats have, in effect, demanded that we spend the next six months talking about Biden and his son's alleged corruption because that's at the core of this Ukraine story. If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's alleged corruption.

That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really.

They must have gamed this out. They must know. Is it sabotage? Well, honestly, we don't know. We're not in the room. Maybe it is.

Or maybe Democrats have just become so obsessed with destroying Donald Trump, that they're destroying themselves accidentally.

Trump released the transcript as Democrats suspected he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into influencing the 2020 election -- specifically, that he threatened to withhold foreign aid if Zelensky didn't investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's conduct.

The transcript, although incomplete, did not show an explicit quid pro quo on Trump's part but did show the two leaders discussing the controversy surrounding Biden. “There's not an explicit quid pro quo here... is this a big bowl of nothing or is there really something here?” King asked.

King's question came after many Republicans accused Democratic politicians of grasping at straws in an attempt to undermine the president.

Bernie Sanders sinks to a distant third in a number of new national and early voting state polls, top members of his presidential campaign are taking aim at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- the other progressive superstar in the Democratic nomination race who’s soared ahead of Sanders in the surveys.

The swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator's campaign, with a hitherto ""truce"" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the independent senator’s campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.”

WARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD

Sanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their ""Medicare-for-all"" proposals.

And both had refrained from attacking each other.

“Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders.

Sanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”

But that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders' team from taking aim at Warren.

The Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts.

Gray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign's lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June.

Sanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff.

In another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.”

As they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot.

WARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID

While Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.

“They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

The strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.”"

""He has no business involving himself in a criminal case against his rival. We just don't do that in America. It's so gross to read that transcript. When I read that, one of my first thoughts was 'geez, what the hell does the Putin transcripts read like?' ... We know what he thinks of Putin, what has he given away to the Russians?"" he asked.

When pressed by anchor Harris Faulkner on the allegations surrounding Biden and his son's business dealings in Ukraine, Swalwell said there is ""no evidence"" of impropriety.

""If you want to show me evidence, I'm open-minded,"" said the former presidential candidate.

Swalwell, who was vocal in recent years alleging Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election, said if Trump asked Ukraine for help with his presidential campaign, he could have potentially owed them a favor in return.

""It's so corrupt,"" he said.

The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment.

The document, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. A notation on the memo says it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call. It is still presented in transcript form.

The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject of Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said in the phone call.

“Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

NBC News summarized what the public learned this morning:

The whistleblower says White House officials told them the conversation on July 25 between Trump and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] was removed from the computer system that is typically used for such records of calls with foreign leaders. Instead, the whistleblower writes, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is used only for information that is of an “especially sensitive nature.” One White House official described that as an abuse of the secure system because there was nothing “remotely sensitive” on the phone call from a national security perspective, the whistleblower said. According to White House officials the whistleblower spoke with, that was “not the first time” the Trump administration placed a presidential transcript “into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive – rather than national security sensitive – information.”

The same whistleblower complaint said there was a “word-for-word transcript” of the call, which was among the records that Trump aides intervened to “lock down.”

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who routinely votes with the White House’s position, has already downplayed the significance of the broader scandal and has even suggested he wants to use his gavel to investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 race.

But even Johnson isn’t fully comfortable with this detail from the whistleblower’s complaint [Update: see below].

“I would not be happy. We’ll find out exactly what transpired here. To me, of all this stuff, that’s the part that concerns me,” Johnson told Politico this morning. He added, “I was led to believe [that summary] was all that’s available. I would be a little upset to find out there’s a completely verbatim one.”

That, of course, is a thread worth pulling on. Indeed, if there’s a “word-for-word transcript” of the call, when will that be released? How much worse might it make the president look? Why was it hidden? At whose direction?

When yesterday’s rough transcript was released, the New York Times told readers the document was “developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with experts and note takers listening.” Of course, voice recognition software is dependent on audio, which further raises the possibility of recorded tapes.

To be sure, the version of the Trump/Zelensky conversation that the world saw yesterday was deeply unflattering – and it vastly increased the odds that the Republican will be impeached in the coming months. But there were curious ellipses in key sections.

If there’s a more complete and more accurate version of the phone meeting, circumstances suggest the White House has a responsibility to disclose it, too.

Update: It looks like Johnson changed his mind after making these comments, concluding, “My concerns were satisfied.”"

So far the only inappropriate behavior that I'm seeing in this entire thing is that of Vice President Joe Biden, in order to help his son.""

Sanders likened the recent impeachment push by Democrats to the Russia investigation and accused them of using a ""fake scandal"" to dupe American voters and regain executive power.

""This is exactly out of the Democrats' playbook,"" she said. ""They used a fake scandal with Russia. Now they're trying to create a fake scandal with Ukraine. It doesn't matter who the actors are. The real bad players in this whole process are the Democrats, trying to fool American voters.

""The good thing is, the American voters are far too smart to fall for the Democrat lies,"" Sanders continued. ""I think one of the best things that's coming out of this is the contrast of who is showing up to be fit to lead our country in a very trying time.""

Sanders also said the Democratic Party has become so anti-Trump, they're willing to hurt the country if it means hurting the president.

""Time and time again the Democrats show their true colors. They don't care about the country,"" she added. ""They care about tearing the president down. They've completely lost sight of what is important and are singularly focused on making sure they destroy the president and win reelection.""

Sanders spoke shortly before the public release of a whistleblower complaint involving Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

But after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated.

READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT

Maguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint itself that was released publicly Thursday morning, and said it's up to them to decide how to proceed.

“The horse has left the barn,” Maguire said. “You have all of the information. You have the whistleblower complaint. You have the letter from the ICIG. You have the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and you have the transcript from the president.”

Maguire also stressed that the complaint was essentially ""hearsay"" and not “corroborated by other folks.”

“This is second-hand information. I am not criticizing the whistleblower,” Maguire said. “... I am in no position to tell the committee to do an investigation or not to do an investigation.”

Schiff vowed at the end ""we are gonna find out"" the backstory, including whether U.S. aid was tied in any way to Trump's investigation request, which the president denies.

The combative conclusion of the session reflected the high tensions and enormous stakes surrounding Maguire's appearance. The rare open hearing of the intelligence committee commanded Washington's political attention given the implications for the newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump, related to the whistleblower complaint.

Shortly after the hearing ended, Trump fired back on Twitter, saying: “Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!”

He told reporters that the process is a “disgrace,” defended his Ukraine call as “absolutely perfect” and accused Democrats of bringing any legislative progress to a standstill.

“They’re frozen, the Democrats,” he said.

Maguire's reputation was also on trial Thursday. He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.

Maguire insisted he is ""not partisan"" and ""not political,"" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times.

""I have served and led through turbulent times,"" he said. ""... My integrity has never been questioned until now.""

However, he maintained, ""I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times.”

At one point in the hearing, during a tense exchange with Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., about allegations in the complaint of a potential “cover-up” regarding the Ukraine call, Maguire pushed back again by reminding the committee that the complaint was not based on direct knowledge.

“This is second-hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge if that is a true and accurate statement,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim. The complaint said White House officials tried to “lock down” records of the call. In the same document, the whistleblower also acknowledged not being a “direct witness” to most of the events described, instead citing other U.S. officials who are not named.

Republican members also jumped to Maguire's defense at the hearing, while accusing Democrats of launching an ""information warfare operation"" against Trump. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said of Maguire: ""I think you're nuts if you're going to convince the American people that your cause is just by attacking this man, by impugning his character.""

Schiff, meanwhile, questioned Maguire over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee. Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues. He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such ""complicated and sensitive issues.""

""I believe that this matter is unprecedented,"" he testified. He also said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, but said he or she acted in ""good faith.""

Maguire maintained that he was ""not stonewalling"" despite the delay in the release of the complaint to the committee, but following ""the law the way it was written, not the law as people might wish it to be."" Maguire again explained that he was required to review the complaint for executive privilege.

""It took longer than I would have liked,"" he said. ""But once the transcripts were released, no longer was there an issue of executive privilege ... so then I was able to release the information to you.""

He added: ""At no time did I ever try to withhold information.""

The complaint cites “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call"" between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and accuses Trump of attempting “to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.” It also presents allegations that the White House tried to ""restrict access"" to records of the call.

The complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were ""directed"" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information.

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS

Meanwhile, Republicans on the committee, including Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused Democrats of orchestrating a public spectacle.

""I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president, and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,"" Nunes said, adding that “we’ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases, press conferences, and fake news stories.”

""The released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion, but that didn't matter,"" he continued. ""The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn't need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president.""

The White House, on Wednesday, released an unclassified version of the transcript of that controversial phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.

Maguire says that the whistleblower complaint released Thursday ""is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.""

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.

Hours after the transcript was released, Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Reporters asked Zelensky about the call with Trump, and whether he felt pressured by the U.S. president, as alleged by the whistleblower—an accusation he denied.

“I think you read everything. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,” he said. “We had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.”

He added: “I think you read it that nobody pushed me.”

Republicans have also raised concerns about the whistleblower's possible ""political bias,"" as the intelligence community inspector general found indications the whistleblower was ""in favor of a rival political candidate"" of Trump.

Whistleblower complaint on Trump-Ukraine call declassified, contains 'no surprises,' GOP lawmaker says

Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart announced on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" and on social media late Wednesday that the explosive whistleblower complaint concerning President Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader has been declassified -- and Stewart said that it doesn't contain any damning information. ""The entirety of it is focused on this one thing, and that's the transcript of one phone call,"" he said. Stewart added that he was initially ""anxious"" before viewing the complaint but concluded ""this is going to go nowhere. ... there are just no surprises there.""

Stewart was among bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate who gained access to the whistleblower complaint in a classified setting on Wednesday. House Democrats emerging from a secure room would not divulge details of the document, but described it as disturbing and urgent. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said it ""exposed serious wrongdoing."" The complaint was not immediately available to the public but was expected to be released Thursday morning. Click here for more on our top story.

Acting Director of National Intelligence to testify before Congress on whistleblower complaint

Rep. Stewart's claim came hours before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was set to testify before Congress on Thursday. On Wednesday, Maguire denied a Washington Post report that he had threatened to turn in his resignation over concerns that the White House might try to make him stonewall Congress over the whistleblower controversy. Meanwhile, Fox News is told there was serious conversation among lawmakers as to how far Maguire could go in an open session at the hearing. One source tells Fox News the administration may have declassified the document so it could be discussed publicly during the hearing.

Read the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian president

The White House on Wednesday released a declassified transcript of President Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It showed that Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. The president made the request on the call only after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike.

Multiple news outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, and the Washington Post, inaccurately reported that the ""favor"" related specifically to investigating Biden. The transcript also did not show that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in the Post had claimed.

Trump demands 'full transparency' over whistleblower allegations -- and from Joe Biden

A defiant President Trump said during a press conference in New York Wednesday that he wants ""full transparency"" not only over the ""so-called whistleblower"" allegations leveled against him, but also ""from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China."" Trump also demanded ""transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president ... to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.""

The president's comments signaled that the White House would seek to turn the tables against Democrats who have initiated a formal impeachment inquiry. Biden, Trump's potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election, said the allegations against the president are impeachable, but his job is to ""beat him"" in the election.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

Earlier this month Warren landed the endorsement of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., accused President Trump of ""betrayal"" Tuesday after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry over the commander-in-chief's interactions with Ukraine's president.

""When you ask a foreign government for help you owe them something which means one day you may have to put another country's interests ahead of America's interests, which to me is betrayal,"" Swalwell said on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum.""

Trump allegedly pushed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Biden has acknowledged that while he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT

Sources told Fox News that Trump personally ordered White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he allegedly discussed the potential investigation of the Bidens with Zelensky.

When MacCallum asked Swalwell about the importance of the intelligence community whistleblower report, the congressman said it was not needed for an investigation and described it as ""color.""

""We already have the president's admission... he's copped to the crime. So we don't really need the whistleblower report,"" Swalwell said. ""I think it will add color to the investigation.""

Swalwell also said Trump's alleged comments during the phone call was enough for impeachment.

""But again, if that had never happened -- if he had never worked with the Russians or embraced their help or obstructed justice or took money from foreign nationals, this act alone would be impeachable, ""Swalwell said.

The congressman also believes direct ""quid pro quo"" statements are not needed, that the president's own words are enough to impeach.

""When you listen to the president's own words, by asking the Ukrainians to do this when you ask somebody to do something you owe them something in the future... that's enough,"" Swalwell said.

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Richard Burr, R-N.C., told Fox News he and several other members of the congressional intelligence panels were still in the process of reading the complaint, which raised red flags about a July 25 phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian leader.

The complaint alleged that Trump tried to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter for possible corruption in exchange for U.S. aid.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., thanked the whistleblower for coming forward after reviewing the complaint and said that he would ""do everything possible to protect you.""

""I think that what this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing,"" Schiff told Fox News as he left the SCIF -- sensitive compartmentalized information facility -- on Wednesday.""I think the travesty is that this complaint was withheld as long as it was because it was an urgent matter. It is an urgent matter. And there was simply no basis to keep this from the committee.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. told Fox News that the complaint ""doesn't change anything about the urgency and the credibility of the issue, and we will press the DNI [director of national intelligence] tomorrow to, you know, produce the full report.""

Neither Schiff nor Swalwell would confirm the specifics of the complaint and related documents that they reviewed.

On a related note, the House also voted on a resolution Wednesday to have the complaint by an unnamed member of the intelligence community be released to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees before hearings on Thursday with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire are scheduled to take place.

Senate Intel Vice Chair Mark Warner said he's ""still processing"" the complaint he read but added, ""it's going to make the testimony received tomorrow all that more important to get some questions cleared up.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he's ""even more worried about what happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation. There are so many fact to be examined.""

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., after reviewing the complaint tweeted: ""I do not support impeachment of President Trump. I have just read the whistleblower complaint made available to House Intelligence Committee Members. I believe strongly in transparency and it should be immediately declassified and made public for the American people to read.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday that there will be a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump. Dems have accused him of ""unprecedented and highly inappropriate efforts"" to discredit the whistleblower and violate the law by not sending the August complaint to Congress.

The White House released a summary of notes from the July 25 conversation between Trump and Zelensky in hopes of tamping down calls for impeachment.

In one sense this moment was probably inevitable. Most Democrats and most of the media have never accepted Mr. Trump as a legitimate President. They can’t believe 63 million Americans voted for him over their nominee, Hillary Clinton, so they have looked every day since Election Night in 2016 for some reason to expel him from office.

They spent two years spinning a tale of Russian collusion that proved to be false. Then they hyped obstruction of justice because Mr. Trump fired James Comey as FBI director, but the public wasn’t persuaded.

Mrs. Pelosi has now found a rationale in a whistleblower’s accusation about Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call to Ukraine’s President. Mr. Trump admits that he warned Volodymyr Zelensky about corruption, including Joe Biden ’s interventions in Ukraine against a prosecutor who was investigating a company with ties to Mr. Biden ’s son, Hunter. Mr. Trump also admits that he delayed U.S. aid to Ukraine in early July prior to the phone call out of concern for corruption and allied burden sharing."

“Today isn't what impeachment looks like, and this afternoon's press conference changes nothing legally,” Collins said in a statement following the speaker’s announcement on Tuesday. “There has been no House vote to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry.”

He added “If Democrats believed the facts were in their favor, they would provide the due process that the House provided under the Clinton and Nixon impeachments.”

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

On Tuesday Pelosi, D-Calif., said: ""The president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

She effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the Democratic caucus to act. The move could support Democrats' disputed argument in court that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents.

Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

But there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi's gambit could backfire, as Republicans predicted over the weekend.

“No matter how many Democrats subscribe to the fantasy that the House began an impeachment inquiry—whether in March, July, August or September—neither Chairman [Jerrold] Nadler nor Speaker Pelosi have unilateral authority to launch one,"" Collins said on Tuesday night.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and fellow Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have been investigating Trump as part of what they've called impeachment proceedings. Notably, Nadler hauled Trump's former 2016 campaign manager, Cory Lewandowski, in front of his committee last week for a combative five hours of testimony related to possible impeachable conduct by the president.

AOC ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: 'WHAT HE HAS ADMITTED TO IS ALREADY IMPEACHABLE, REGARDLESS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS'

On Tuesday evening, Pelosi announced that multiple House committees are now moving forward with an impeachment inquiry.

""This is the first partisan 'impeachment' in the history of the republic, and the real victims are the American people,” Collins said. “They elected Donald Trump to be our president and their representatives to solve the border crisis and support a growing economy. Instead of accepting those facts, Democrats are sowing chaos, not producing legislative solutions.”

He went on to say, “The chaos began in the Judiciary Committee, and now it's seeping into the rest of the House.”

Trump vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky by Wednesday.

Additionally, a senior administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the White House is working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint, as long as it's legally possible. The official told Fox News the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing.

The president beat them at their own game by choosing to be completely transparent with the American people. In releasing the transcript of his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump showed that he had nothing to hide.

Contrary to hysterical media reports, there was no “quid pro quo.” There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever. And Joe Biden was barely given a mention over the course of 30 minutes. In fact, his name came up just once.

GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG – STILL, PELOSI AND HER COLLEAGUES WILL DO ANYTHING TO UNDO 2016

What really debunks the Democrats’ and the media’s narrative is what Trump legitimately asked for: help with the ongoing investigation by the attorney general into the corrupt origins of the Russia investigation and Ukraine’s involvement in it.

Given the Democrats’ obsession with election meddling in 2016, their sudden lack of interest in getting to the bottom of what happened is hypocritical at best. They’ve made it clear that they were never interested in investigating the integrity of our democratic process. They are only interested in baseless investigations of the president.

Two years later, nothing has changed.

As we expected, the Democrats’ baseless claims that Trump enlisted Ukraine in his reelection efforts were proven false. The president only mentioned Biden in passing during the phone call.

Contrary to hysterical media reports, there was no “quid pro quo.” There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever.

Biden, on the other hand, was caught on tape bragging about threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless it ired the prosecutor tasked with investigating Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month as a board member. Talk about “quid pro quo.” Trump merely noted on the matter in his phone call with Zelensky, “It sounds horrible to me.”

The Department of Justice also found there was no merit to an alleged campaign finance violation during the call. This is unsurprising, given the initial complaint that kicked off the latest media anti-Trump spasm came from a whistleblower with “political bias” represented by a Democratic attorney.

Enlisting foreign nationals to do your dirty work is a page right out of the Democrats’ playbook. Just as the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton paid for disinformation on Trump from Russian sources, it was the Democrats who asked Ukraine for help to “sabotage Trump” in 2016.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE 'SHAKEDOWN'

The committee chairs -- Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. -- helped turn up the pressure on the White House as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., started pursuing official impeachment proceedings. During her Tuesday announcement, Pelosi specifically accused the administration of breaking the law by suppressing a whistleblower from reporting on Trump's comments to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The committees' subpoena threat came just after the White House released a transcript of the president's July call with Zelensky in an apparent attempt to assuage concerns he engaged in some kind of quid pro quo.

The transcript contained no explicit quid pro quo for foreign aid but stoked Democrats' concerns as it showed Trump requesting an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden at a sensitive time in U.S.-Ukrainian relations.

Democrats suspected that Trump tried to interfere in the 2020 election by pressuring Zelensky into pursuing allegations that Biden, seen as the frontrunner among Democrats seeking to unseat Trump, improperly influenced the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in order to protect his son Hunter. Shokin had been investigating a natural gas firm that Hunter Biden led as a member of the board of directors.

'SQUAD' MEMBERS CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT AFTER TRUMP RELEASES UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT: 'WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT'

""Let’s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections -- that is betrayal enough. The corruption exists whether or not Trump threatened -- explicitly or implicitly -- that a lack of cooperation could result in withholding military aid,"" the statement by chairs of the House Oversight, Judiciary, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs committees read.

“Ukraine depends on the U.S. for economic, military, and diplomatic support -- especially in its attempts to push back against Russian aggression -- and is particularly vulnerable to pressure from any U.S. president. For a country so reliant on the United States, nothing more was needed.

""The call reportedly was preceded by a decision by Trump to withhold vital security assistance, and it was followed in quick succession by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, meeting with a top aide to the new Ukrainian president at Trump’s direction. According to reports, the Ukrainians eventually became aware that the aid was being withheld and expressed concern to U.S. officials.""

Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has admitted to telling Ukraine to investigate Biden but maintained it was not a part of any broader attempt to influence the 2020 presidential election.

Fox News Exclusive: White House to release document showing intel community watchdog found whistleblower had 'political bias,' official says

A senior Trump administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the administration will release a document showing the intelligence community inspector general found the whistleblower who leveled an explosive accusation against President Trump concerning his talks with Ukraine had “political bias” in favor of “a rival candidate” of the president. The official did not identify the name of the rival candidate.

Separately, a senior administration official told Fox News the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump's conversations with the leader of Ukraine, as long as it's legally possible. The news came just hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry by alleging that the administration was hiding the complaint. Other top Democrats had previously said such an inquiry was already underway.

The senior administration official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, and that the White House's general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump's conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's July call with Zelensky. Trump vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of the call by Wednesday. Click here for more on our top story.

Giuliani, Republicans: Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of Trump will backfire

One of the biggest questions is whether House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump will backfire. Democrats have suggested Trump, in his call with Zelensky, tried to convince the Ukraine government into investigating potential 2020 presidential election opponent Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the Biden family's business dealings. The president, Democrats have suggested, had $400 million in aid to Ukraine frozen to pressure officials into pursuing the Biden investigation. The Trump administration says the decision to freeze funding came more than a week before his call with Zelensky and that it was based on concerns about broader Ukraine corruption.

The contents of the call, as well as the whistleblower complaint, could throw cold water on Democrats' explosive suggestions. A senior administration official told Fox News there are a “few words” in the transcript that will raise eyebrows, but it is nowhere near as inflammatory as Democrats have suggested. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

Plus, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani -- who has long publicly called for Ukraine to investigate Biden's dealings in Ukraine -- posted a series of messages on Twitter suggesting Democrats have a bigger problem on their hands with corruption involving ""high level members of the Obama cabinet"" and ""multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play."" ""Slimy Joe is not alone,"" Giuliani tweeted. Click on the video above to see Giuliani's appearance on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

Meanwhile, Trump is set to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters.

GOP lawmaker introduces resolution to remove Nadler as Judiciary panel chairman over impeachment probe

A Republican congressman introduced a resolution on Tuesday calling for the ouster of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., from his panel post for pursuing impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The proceedings were formally backed late Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, said in a release that Nadler has acted against the will of the House of Representatives, which never gave his committee explicit authorization to begin impeachment proceedings. The body voted 332-95 in July to table an impeachment resolution from Rep. Al Green, D-Texas.

Fox News Exclusive: Iran President Rouhani downplays chance of Trump UN meeting, says president took trust away from relationship

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani all but closed the door on potentially meeting with President Trump this week, and blamed the commander-in-chief for damaging relations between the two countries, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on Tuesday. Rouhani, in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, was asked if there was any chance the two leaders would speak to each other this week.

""Why would we bump into one another?"" the Iranian leader told Wallace. ""If we seek to pursue higher goals to benefit both countries, both people, it must be planned, and talks must be based on those plans. But prior to that, we must create mutual trust and that is something that Mr. Trump took away from this framework."" Rouhani is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday.

UAW's strike against GM enters day 10 and neither side reportedly can agree on this key issue

The United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors is entering day 10, and while there are various issues being discussed, there is one point the two sides argue about the most. Temporary workers have been the top request among union members, according to the Detroit Free Press. Temp workers are union members doing the same work as permanent employees but get half the pay and far fewer benefits. The union wants those workers to get a path to being permanent and as temps, get pay and benefits that more closely match their permanent counterparts.

But that’s not quite what the conversation revealed. No matter.

Pelosi and rabid Trump-hating Democrats long ago preordained their impeachment ambitions. Any pretext to achieve that end will do just fine. But the speaker’s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed. Pelosi and her confederates will do anything to undo the 2016 election results and drive Trump from office.

Nevertheless, facts are stubborn things. They are critical, if not dispositive, in legal cases. They are also highly relevant in the inherently political process known as impeachment.

MARC THIESSEN: TRUMP, UKRAINE AND DEMOCRATS' DOUBLE STANDARD

So, let’s examine what we have learned so far, realizing that many more facts have yet to be unspooled in what Trump is now calling the latest version of the interminable “witch hunt.”

The Telephone Conversation

The early reporting on the leaked conversation with Zelensky alleged that Trump demanded a “quid pro quo.” That is, Trump allegedly ordered Ukraine to help investigate allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, or the U.S. would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. However, the transcript shows no demands or conditions were stated or otherwise discussed. No promises were contingent on financial assistance. Did President Trump apply pressure on Zelensky? There is no evidence of that in their discussion.

Instead, after congratulating the Ukrainian president on his election to office, Trump asked Zelensky to help investigate matters of alleged wrongdoing involving “this whole situation with Ukraine.” Trump made vague references to Crowdstrike and “the server.”

This appears to be a reference to the origins of the Russia “collusion” investigation and the suspected role of Ukraine, the Democratic National Committee, and the cybersecurity firm that the DNC retained to examine hacked servers.

This part of the conversation is cryptic. But if Ukraine possesses some evidence of corrupt acts involving Democrats or Hillary Clinton surrogates or anyone else, this would logically be something that the U.S. should be made aware of.

The phone conversation between the two leaders then turned to fired Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Trump remarked how “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.” The videotape of Biden boasting of the “quid pro quo” he engineered is a remarkable lesson in hubris and foolishness.

The speaker’s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed.

By way of background, Shokin is on record telling the Washington Post that he was fired in 2015 because he was investigating Hunter Biden and his Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, and that then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion dollars in U.S. aid unless Shokin was sacked:

“I will answer that the activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the (prosecutor general’s office) investigators on his tail, are the only, I emphasize, the only motives for organizing my resignation.”

Fast forward to the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelensky telephone call. Zelensky volunteered that a new investigator would look into the matter. Trump asked Zelensky to speak with Attorney General William Barr and the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about it. This was not unreasonable.

Democrats, like Pelosi, claim that the conversation is absolute proof that Trump was asking a foreign government to help him damage his political opponent, Biden, in the upcoming election. But the proof is not absolute at all.

If the president of the United States is made aware of suspected corrupt acts by a public official involving a foreign nation, he has every right to ask that nation to either investigate and/or produce any evidence. Indeed, it is incumbent on him to do so.

One of the president’s fundamental duties is identified in the “take care” clause (or “faithful execution” clause) of the U.S. Constitution. It imposes duty on the chief executive to take care “that the Laws be faithfully executed.” President George Washington observed, “it is my duty to see the Laws executed; to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to that duty.”

Whether it be immigration laws or finance laws or criminal statutes, the president is duty-bound to enforce all laws. Failure to do so would be a dereliction of his duty, as our first president believed.

Biden does not get immunity simply because he used to be vice president or is currently running for president. Was Biden’s confessed “quid pro quo” pressure on Ukraine a potential crime? More facts and evidence is needed. But using your public office to benefit your son might constitute such corruption crimes as bribery or honest services fraud. On this basis, Trump had every right to ask for evidentiary assistance from a foreign power.

Unlike Biden, who threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer money from Ukraine, Trump did not explicitly mention the freezing of roughly $400 million from Kiev.

The president has repeatedly stated he put a hold on the funds because he was reticent about giving such an enormous sum of money to a newly elected president who was taking over a government widely known for corruption.

As columnist Marc Thiessen pointed out in the Washington Post, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durban, and Patrick Leahy had been far more overt two months earlier when, in a letter, “they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake” if the nation’s prosecutor general did not capitulate to their own demands over the closing of several investigations connected to the Mueller investigation. Hypocrisy, of course, is rampant throughout this sordid story.

The “Whistleblower” Complaint

All of this came to a sudden boil when a complaint was filed recently by a so-far unidentified employee of the intelligence community. Citing the Trump-Zelensky conversation that he or she did not hear or even read in transcript form, the employee nevertheless filed a whistleblower complaint against the president based on nothing more than hearsay.

The complaint was legal folly. It does not qualify as a whistleblower complaint as defined by the whistleblower statute (50 U.S.C. 3033). Why? Because a whistleblower cannot blow the whistle on the president.

This means that he or she is not really a “whistleblower” at all under the specific language and meaning of the law, as I argued in my column last week.

This was explained in an 11-page opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) when it issued the follow opinion:

“The president is not a member of the intelligence community, and his communication with a foreign leader involved no intelligence operation or other activity aimed at collecting or analyzing foreign intelligence.”

Under the whistleblower statute, both these conditions are required. Yet, neither were met. As a consequence, the complaint “does not trigger a reporting obligation” to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). This DOJ opinion is also shared by the General Counsel in the Office of the DNI.

Pelosi declared that the law is “unequivocal” that the DNI “shall” give Congress the whistleblower complaint. This would be true if the complaint qualified under the whistleblower law, but it does not. Pelosi was incorrect.

The OLC opinion made clear that the complaint “does not trigger a reporting obligation” and that the DNI does not have “a statutory obligation to forward the complaint to the intelligence committees.”

In our constitutional form of government, the president is a unitary executive. He is not in any department or agency. He is not a member of the intelligence community. A “whistleblower” can only complain about misconduct by someone in the intelligence community.

Acting DNI Joseph Maguire will appear at a public congressional hearing on Thursday. He will surely reiterate all of the above so that Pelosi, who bragged that she is an “authority” on the law, might understand what the law actually means.

Despite all of this, the speaker and Democrats are determined to pursue their impeachment dreams. Facts and evidence are of little consequence.

After all, many pundits, especially on the left, longed for the same outcome during the Russia investigation, only to be bitterly disappointed.

But the Ukraine uproar has a far simpler story line than the complicated Russia probe. And it proved a tipping point for the House speaker, who has long believed that impeachment could boomerang on the Democrats without ultimately ousting Trump, who she sees as highly vulnerable in 2020. But with 175 of her members, including some moderates, hopping on the impeachment bandwagon, Pelosi could no longer stem the tide.

HOW TRUMP AND ALLIES ARE SHIFTING THE UKRAINE SPOTLIGHT TO BIDEN

In a flag-bedecked speech, Pelosi said Trump’s actions on Ukraine “have seriously violated the Constitution,” that he “must be held accountable,” and announcing an “official” investigation by a half-dozen committees.

As strange as it sounds, Pelosi’s reluctant move could in some ways help Trump, because it shifts the terms of debate.

Trump’s preferred mode of defense is to go on offense—whether it’s against Crooked Hillary, Mueller’s angry Democrats or Sleepy Joe’s alleged transgressions. It’s all about demonizing the other side, just as the left does to Trump.

Especially after his planned release today of a transcript of his July call with Ukraine’s leader, the president and his allies can argue that even if he went too far in bringing up Joe Biden with a foreign leader, it does not warrant the drastic remedy of impeachment.

He’s already called it “witch hunt garbage,” and will undoubtedly cast it as one perpetrated by his enemies in the opposition party, the press and the Deep State. He can energize his supporters, who will see their hero in danger of being forced from office. And the resulting fireworks will not only obliterate any semblance of a Democratic agenda, it will overshadow what Biden, Bernie, Elizabeth and the rest are doing on the trail.

Trump asked, not unreasonably, how Pelosi could take this step without even having seen the details of the phone call.

Outside the hothouse of the media and political world, I don’t sense that Ukraine has quite reached the level of a political earthquake. And that, for the moment, has the president’s critics baffled.

I believe the media coverage is a key factor, as I’ll explain in a moment.

But first, there’s no doubt that the Washington Post moved the ball with a report that Trump told his acting chief of staff “to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials.”

The piece says that OMB officials relayed Trump’s order to State and the Pentagon, and were ordered to give members of Congress no explanation beyond that the delay was part of an “interagency process.”

The story also quoted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy as saying that Ukrainian President Zelensky told him during a visit this month that the aid was cut off as a “consequence” of his unwillingness to launch a probe of the Bidens. (The money has since been released.)

The president did not deny the story but shifted his explanation, saying he held up the money because he wanted Europe to pay more for Ukraine’s defense. He also scoffed at the notion of impeachment before his speech at the U.N., telling reporters: “What Joe Biden did for his son, that’s something they should be looking at.”

The New York Times’ Peter Baker reported yesterday morning that Trump now seems to be saying, as the headline puts it, “So What If I Did?”

The piece calls this “an astonishing breach of the norms governing the American presidency…If anything, the president has grown even more defiant since Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, almost as if having avoided charges, he is daring the establishment to come after him again. The man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent.”

With more House Democrats coming out for impeachment—more than two-thirds of Nancy Pelosi’s caucus is now in that camp—the question of whether Ukraine is a dramatic tipping point looms large.

My sense is that there’s a fatigue factor for Trump scandals. And besides the president and Rudy Giuliani trying to shift the spotlight to the Bidens, as I wrote yesterday, the media coverage of the last few years is coloring the current climate.

Take the Bob Mueller probe. While I’ve always argued the Russia investigation was a legitimately big story that led to several high-level indictments, can anyone really dispute that the coverage was so histrionic as to be misleading? The constant drumbeat was so relentless and so negative that it seemed only a matter of time before Trump was run out of town. Every minor development was cranked up to 11.

And while the final report contained disturbing material, it also found no evidence that Trump actively cooperated with Russian operatives or hackers, and Mueller’s halting testimony was the final nail in the coffin.

When the media fixated for more than a week on Sharpie-gate—and yes, Trump fueled the coverage with daily blasts about his handling of the hurricane—it was another case of runaway hype.

The same was true in episode after episode: Porn stars! Michael Cohen! S-hole countries! Omarosa! Tax returns! Greenland! Go back where they came from! Rat-infested Baltimore!

Most of these controversies were very real, sometimes troubling, and yet trumpeted with a this-time-he’s-gone-too-far tone until each story faded. Trump’s constant pushback against the “fake news media,” and his attacks on Democrats and “witch hunt” investigators, added to the feeling that these were nothing more than partisan brawls.

In other words, journalists are suffering from boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome. Now that they have extremely serious allegations to pursue, the ensuing uproar sounds too much like so many other scandals and mini-scandals that, fairly or unfairly, didn’t move the needle.

There’s also an emerging theory, argued for some time by the Federalist’s Ben Domenech, that Trump wants to be impeached.

Ross Douthat, the conservative, anti-Trump New York Times columnist, expanded on this view yesterday:

“If the Democrats impeach him they will be doing something unpopular instead of something popular… the likely Democratic nominees are all more popular than Trump, and so anything that puts the Democrats on the wrong side of public opinion may look better, through Trump’s eyes, than the status quo…

“Trump is happy to pit his overt abuses of power against the soft corruption of his foes. This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president’s critics find particularly infuriating — the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself.”

Whether or not you agree that he did something wrong, he excels at these dual-corruption debates, that it’s the other side that should face prison terms.

No president, not even Donald Trump, wants to be impeached. But if past journalistic excesses help convince the public that the Ukraine story is just more exaggeration, and if the press is viewed as a pro-impeachment movement, Trump will paint the media as helping the Democrats try to end his term."

Pelosi spoke to reporters after the release of a whistleblower complaint regarding Trump’s July call with Zelensky. The complaint said officials tried to ""lock down"" records of the call, in which Trump sought Ukraine's help investigating the Biden family.

“This is a cover up,” Pelosi said. “Here we are with another example of the disregard for the Constitution by the president.”

READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT

Pelosi added: “When you have a system for electronic storage that is specifically not used and you have something that is politically helpful for the president and you hide it someplace else, that is a cover-up.”

During a separate hearing on Capitol Hill, however, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire cautioned against jumping to conclusions on allegations of a ""cover-up"" and more, noting the complaint was not based on direct knowledge.

“This is second-hand information from a whistleblower,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim.

Pelosi’s comments come as the unnamed whistleblower’s complaints were made public, two days after she announced that the House was opening a formal impeachment inquiry over the issue.

The complaint alleges Trump abused the power of his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in next year's U.S. election.

On the call, Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE

Trump has denied doing anything wrong and says the record of the call, which was released publicly on Wednesday, vindicates him of any wrongdoing.

“The president thinks this proves his innocence, which only shows how much he doesn’t understand right from wrong,” Pelosi said.

The House speaker has for months brushed off calls from her party’s more liberal members to open impeachment proceedings against Trump, but Thursday she bristled at the assertion that she had changed her mind about going forward.

“We wanted to have a fuller understanding of the facts,” she said. “I didn’t change my mind.”

“The president of the United States and his actions with a telephone call with another head of state betrayed his oath of office,” Pelosi added. “We have to have an inquiry to further the facts.”

As of Wednesday, a majority of House members have publicly supported impeachment proceedings against Trump, with 217 Democrats and independent Rep. Justin Amash all being in favor of opening the inquiry into the president.

One House member not supporting the impeachment push is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who in his weekly press briefing said that Pelosi opened the inquiry without any evidence against Trump.

""She opened [an] impeachment inquiry without even seeing one word of evidence,"" he said. ""[E]ven her own members questioned that she moved too soon. And when the evidence was released the Democrats, and many of the media, twisted it to what they wanted to believe.""

Before the recent scandal involving the phone call with the Ukrainian president, numerous Democrats had pushed impeachment proceedings or even outright impeachment – mostly over the results of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump campaign links to Russia and whether Trump attempted to obstruct the probe.

That probe did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction issue and did not find evidence of collusion. Pelosi’s statement earlier in the week marks the first time Democratic Party leadership has gotten behind the impeachment effort."

Toobin also defended acting Director of Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who told the committee he may have been given bad advice from the Department of Justice or the White House as to how to handle the whistleblower complaint levied against the president.

""The issue that the Democrats, in particular, were focusing on is why when the law says when there is a credible and urgent inspector general’s report — when the law says it shall be turned over to the Congress, why wasn’t it turned over right away?"" Toobin asked.

""So the question was, did he get really good and fair advice?""

Democrats moved forward with an impeachment investigation after Trump spoke with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky about initiating a probe into Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Hunter was found to have ties to Barisma, a natural gas firm, that paid him $50,000 a month while it was under investigation in a corruption probe. Trump said he wanted answers.

On Feb. 12, 1999, the Senate acquitted Clinton in a presidential impeachment trial and he remained in office.



The clip of Pelosi, which aired on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday, went viral after House Democrats moved forward on an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, alleging he may have withheld military aid to Ukraine while pressuring the country to investigate Joe Biden and his son.

The hosts asked former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the impeachment proceedings against Clinton, about Pelosi's remarks. Gingrich said, unlike the current impeachment push against Trump, Ken Starr's report alleged crimes against Clinton, prompting the House to act.

""In the case of Clinton, he had actually broken the law. He had committed a felony in a case involving sexual predation against an employee. If that happened today, people would be going crazy.

“What’s really happening here is nothing except the perpetration of fiction among the voters of America,” Collins told “Fox & Friends,” challenging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move forward officially.

“If she wants to do it, she needs to bring it to the floor,"" he said.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's July call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump, who has been accused of trying to pressure Zelensky to investigate the family of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of the call by Wednesday.

“What they want them to believe is they’re up here doing something that they are not, simply because they hate this president. They cannot stand the fact that he’s leading, that he’s actually doing stuff for our country and that they can’t defeat that,” Collins said.

He said when it comes to impeachment, Pelosi ""is not a leader,"" but is following liberals in her caucus like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

A senior administration official told Fox News there are a “few words” in the transcript that will raise eyebrows, but it is nowhere near as inflammatory as Democrats have suggested.

“I know for the Democrats if it says ‘the,' 'and,' or a pronoun, they’re going to say it raises eyebrows because all they’ve wanted to actually do is impeach this president,” Collins said.

The contents of the call, as well as the whistleblower complaint, could throw cold water on Democrats' explosive suggestions that the president improperly threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless it investigated Biden and his son, Hunter.

And now that previously classified complaint is available … [+1937 chars]",The scandal that may lead to Trump's impeachment started with a whistleblower complaint. Now that complaint is available to the public.,2019-09-26,MSNBC,Newly released whistleblower complaint sheds light on Trump scandal,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/newly-released-whistleblower-complaint-sheds-light-trump-scandal,"It all started with a whistleblower from within the U.S. intelligence community. This person filed a complaint about alleged presidential wrongdoing with his/her inspector general, going by the book.

And now that previously classified complaint is available – with minimal redactions – for everyone to read.

A whistleblower’s complaint about President Donald Trump, made public on Thursday, says White House officials were so concerned about what the president said in a July call with Ukraine’s new leader that they intervened to “lock down” the record of the phone call. The whistleblower, whose name has not been released, says he lodged the formal complaint because he believed that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 election. In the call, Trump discussed having the Ukrainian president help investigate the Biden family’s business dealings.

The nine-page complaint is available online here (pdf), while the seven-page letter from Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson is available here (pdf).

Near the very beginning of the whistleblower’s complaint, note that it accuses Donald Trump of pressuring “a foreign country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political rivals.” The whistleblower, whose identity is still unknown to the public, added that Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, is “a central figure” in the political scheme, before describing Attorney General Barr, the nation’s chief law-enforcement official, as someone who “appears to be involved as well.”

* The complaint says, “I learned from multiple U.S. Officials that senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down’ all the records of the phone call [between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky], especially the word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room.” He/she added that White House lawyers “directed” that a transcript of the call be removed from the computer system.

It suggests that White House officials not only realized that Trump went too far, but also that the White House took steps to cover up his abuse.

* White House officials told the whistleblower after the call that “they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

* “Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani’s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth.”

* Multiple U.S. officials told the whistleblower that Ukrainian leaders were “led to believe” that a meeting between Trump and Zelensky would depend on whether the Ukrainian president “showed willingness to ‘play ball.’”

* The complaint says there were other instances in which White House officials hid transcripts of Trump phone calls “for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive – rather than national security sensitive – information.”

* Toward the end of the complaint, the whistleblower added that Trump “instructed” Vice President Pence in May to cancel a scheduled trip to Ukraine. Trump wanted to delay top-level meetings until he saw how Zelensky “chose to act.”

Between yesterday’s revelations and today’s, we’re seeing a one-two punch that significantly increases the odds that the American president will be impeached.

Meanwhile, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire, who received the whistleblower complaint but did not originally share it with lawmakers as required by law, is testifying before the House Intelligence Committee right now."

Earlier this week, the Republican… [+2801 chars]","""The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now,"" Trump said today, referring to the whistleblower and his/her WH sources.",2019-09-26,MSNBC,Trump's rhetoric targeting whistleblower...,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-rhetoric-targeting-whistleblower-takes-alarming-turn,"After the public learned of the intelligence community’s whistleblower and his/her complaint against Donald Trump, the president’s initial response was to label the whistleblower a “highly partisan,” based on rumors he’d “heard.” Earlier this week, the Republican went a little further, suggesting people like the complainant “are trying to subvert our country.”

As the Los Angeles Times reported, Trump went quite a bit further today, using the word “treason” in reference to the whistleblower and his/her White House sources.

“Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call – heard something and decided that he or she, or whoever the hell they saw – they’re almost a spy,” Trump said. “I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,” he continued. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

The not-so-subtle implication of the comments – an audio clip of which is now available – is that Trump longs for the days in which Americans were “smart” enough to impose severe physical punishments on those he perceived as traitors.

This comes on the heels of comments in which the sitting president suggested Joe Biden is guilty of misdeeds that would warrant “the electric chair” if committed by a Republican.

Let’s not forget that the intelligence community’s whistleblower may yet provide testimony, raising questions about whether, and to what degree, Trump may hope to intimidate him or her. The same concerns relate to the whistleblower’s White House sources, who may be considered witnesses to presidential wrongdoing.

As for Trump’s “treason” reference, this comes on the heels of the president raising the prospect of a treason investigation into Google, which came on the heels of Trump accusing some in federal law enforcement of “treason,” which came a month after the Republican accused congressional Democrats of engaging in “treasonous” behavior.

As regular readers know, these weren’t isolated incidents. Last year, the New York Times published a rather extraordinary op-ed, written by “a senior official in the Trump administration,” describing a White House in which “many” officials work diligently behind the scenes to subvert Donald Trump. The president suggested the newspaper may have committed “treason” by agreeing to run it.

A few months before that, the president was so bothered by media coverage of his summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un that he described the reports as “really almost treasonous.”

And a few months before that, while whining that Democrats failed to applaud his State of the Union address to his satisfaction, the president said Dems “certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much” – and then raised the prospect of Democratic “treason.”

Now he’s using the same word while complaining about those in his administration who helped expose his efforts to get a foreign government to help his re-election campaign."

“I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation because he had a couple conversations also. I can save you a lot of time. They’re all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations. “But the word is that they’re going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence’s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect.”

The reference to “the first phone conversation” was apparently Trump pointing to a conversation with the Ukrainian leader in April, which may itself be controversial.

But I was also glad to see Trump reference Pence, because his role is of some interest, too. The vice president recently met with Zelensky in Poland, and according to the official transcript, a reporter asked Pence whether his discussion with the Ukrainian leader focused at all on Joe Biden. Pence said no, though he added soon after, “But as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.”

It’s become clear that when Team Trump is talking to Ukraine about “corruption,” it’s little more than a euphemism for the American president’s conspiracy theories and political agenda.

Pence went on to say at the press conference that he told Zelensky that he would “carry back to President Trump the progress that he and his administration in Ukraine are making on dealing with corruption in their country.”

All of which serves as a reminder: Donald Trump may very well be impeached, but this is a controversy with a striking cast of characters. Indeed, Pence’s possible role in the mess is of interest, but he’s hardly alone.

There are related questions about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo …

Lawmakers trying to unravel the controversy over President Donald Trump’s discussions with the leader of Ukraine are increasingly homing in on exactly what role Mike Pompeo played in the drama.

… and the president’s personal attorney …

Even as they publicly insist President Donald Trump did nothing wrong during his call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, his allies are privately acknowledging more serious concerns about the ethical questions raised and the potential political fallout from it – especially over the involvement of Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney.

… and the already scandalous attorney general …

The Trump administration’s release of notes documenting President Donald Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has raised questions about Trump’s relationship with Attorney General William Barr and whether he views Barr as someone whose job includes advocating for him on personal matters.

… and the acting White House chief of staff …

When Trump ordered military aid to Ukraine to be frozen, he went through his chief of staff and budget director Mick Mulvaney. Congress had passed the aid, and Ukraine was under military attack from Russia, a fact that made the halting of the assistance worrisome to numerous officials in two branches of government.

… and the unknown number of White House officials who told an intelligence community whistleblower that they witnessed the president “abuse his office for personal gain.”

To be sure, this is a Trump scandal, through and through. But as the political world experiences this earthquake, the president isn’t the only one wobbling,"

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) went further than most Republicans in taking the controversy seriously. The Utahan said in tweet over the weekend that if the president “asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.”

We now know, of course, that the scenario Romney described is exactly what happened. Nevertheless, for his troubles, the senator faced an online attack from Trump. The signal to other GOP lawmakers wasn’t subtle: those who take a stand on principle should expect to face White House attacks, too.

As of yesterday, Romney wasn’t the only congressional Republican with concerns. The Washington Post reported overnight on new fissures in the GOP’s wall.

Several Senate Republicans were privately stunned Wednesday and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released a rough transcript of President Trump’s call with the Ukraine president that showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a “huge mistake” that the GOP now has to confront and defend – while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump.

It’s important not to overstate the broader dynamic: Trump still has the broad support of his party. Some are sincere, some are acting on partisan reflex, and some are afraid of pushback from the president’s far-right followers, but whatever the motivation, it’d be a mistake to assume Trump has reason to fear significant intra-party defections.

At least for now, that is.

That said, it would also be wrong to believe Republicans are united around the White House’s talking points. After having seen the rough transcript of Trump’s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Romney reiterated his “troubling in the extreme” concerns. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who expressed some modest concerns over the weekend, added yesterday that he considered Trump’s comments to Zelensky “inappropriate,” though the Pennsylvania senator added that he doesn’t see the matter as an impeachable offense.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who’s taken steps in a decidedly Trump-like direction of late, conceded yesterday, “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there.”

True to form, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was willing to say the Trump call summary “raises a number of important questions.”

Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican consultant with a client list that includes John McCain and Jeb Bush, told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell yesterday, “ ‘One Republican senator told me if it was a secret vote, 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump.”

I’d still set expectations low, but it’s a dynamic worth watching."

Giuliani, whose actions as President Trump’s personal lawyer have helped set in motion an impeachment inquiry, is set to appear as a paid speaker at a Kremlin-backed conference in Armenia on Tuesday — an event expected to include the participation of Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and other top Russian officials.”

* Not what the administration wanted to hear: “A federal judge in Los Angeles has blocked the Trump administration from activating new regulations that would have dramatically expanded its ability to detain migrant children with their parents for indefinite periods of time, dealing a blow to the president’s efforts to tamp down unauthorized border crossings.”

* Many will suffer as a result of this decision: “President Donald Trump’s administration has once again set the lowest cap on refugee admissions in the program’s almost 40 year history, allowing fewer than 20,000 resettlements.”

* They’re right: “More than 300 former national security and foreign policy officials signed a letter released Friday labeling President Donald Trump’s growing Ukraine scandal a ‘profound national security concern’ and praising congressional Democrats for formally launching an impeachment inquiry.”

* NRA: “The results of a congressional probe into the National Rifle Association’s ties to Russia paints a picture of NRA officials providing Russian officials access to American elected officials in exchange for lucrative business opportunities.”

* Keep an eye on this one: “Deutsche Bank revealed a bit more about the tax returns it has that are related to President Donald Trump on Friday. In a new court filing, the embattled bank said it has the tax returns of two individuals that could be turned over to the House of Representatives under a subpoena focused on Trump, if a court orders it.”

* 11 Republicans broke ranks on this vote: “The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday backed for a second time legislation that would terminate President Donald Trump’s February declaration of a national emergency on the southern border with Mexico, sending the measure to the White House for Trump’s expected veto.”

* A judicial nominee in trouble: “A second Republican senator said Thursday he will oppose President Trump’s pick for an influential appeals court, raising new questions about the judge’s ability to be confirmed. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) confirmed to reporters that he will oppose Judge Halil Suleyman Ozerden’s nomination to the Louisiana-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.”

""There is not a single person in Washington with any experience in government, not one, who really believes the president was trying to use the Ukrainian government to rig the 2020 election,"" Ingraham said on ""The Ingraham Angle."" ""I don't see how anyone in his or her right mind could legitimately say there's an impeachable offense in this transcript, in the conversation.""

UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER -- BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID

The Trump Administration released a transcript of the president's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country -- but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo.

Ingraham argued that Democrats ""overplayed"" the situation.

""I think it's pretty obvious that the Democrats overplayed their hand big time,"" Ingraham said. ""They base their impeachment move on a whistleblower who didn't even hear the conversation and who grossly exaggerated what happened in it.""

The host compared all Democrats to Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., saying there were no ""moderates left in the Democrat Party.""

Ingraham also said Democrats were ""possessed"" with ""anti-Trump rage.""

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN 'INTERFERENCE' IN ELECTION

However, when Americans learn how deeply involved Hunter Biden was in China and Ukraine while his father was vice president, they will see a scandal involving a lot of money which is easy to understand and easy to condemn.

The Biden-Ukraine money problem is not something new. Five years ago, on May 14, 2014, The Washington Post headline warned: “Hunter Biden’s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power.”

Vice President Biden’s intervention to protect his son, and his son’s company Burisma, from a Ukrainian corruption investigation, was heavy-handed and amazingly arrogant. And there is no question that Biden interfered. In his own words to the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, Biden clearly pushed to have the prosecutor who was investigating his son fired:

“I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from [former Ukrainian President] Poroshenko and from [former Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.

“So they said they had—they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to—or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said—I said, call him. (Laughter.) I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b*tch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

As Deroy Murdock, who is a member of the council, wrote for Fox News, “Biden’s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice.”

Now that the Hunter Biden corruption scandal is beginning to threaten his candidacy, Vice President Biden is trying to come up with a new story.

As Mark Thiessen wrote for The Washington Post and Fox News in his syndicated column on Tuesday, the former vice president is now claiming he never discussed his son’s business dealings overseas. As Thiessen points out, this claim is “flatly untrue.” Hunter Biden, has already told The New Yorker that Vice President Biden discussed the Ukraine business with his son, saying, “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’”

Again citing The New Yorker, Thiessen reported: “‘In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden. That same month, The New York Times published an article about how Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine undermined the vice president’s anti-corruption message, which quoted a Biden spokesman saying it had no impact.”

However, Ukraine is not the only site of scandalous self-enrichment by Hunter Biden. China is an even bigger center of money going to the former vice president’s son – money which would not have gone to him if his name had been Hunter Smith.

Peter Schweizer has become a remarkable researcher and writer about corruption. In a May, 11, 2019 New York Post article, he wrote extensively about the Bidens and China.

The investment firm Hunter Biden operated (along with former-Secretary of State John Kerry’s stepson Chris Heinz and their family friend and operative Devon Archer) in his dealings with China was Rosemont Seneca Partners, which formed in 2009.

By 2010, Hunter Biden and Archer “were in China meeting with top Chinese officials,” Schweizer wrote. By the way, Rosemont also partnered with the Thornton Group, which is led by James Bulger (the nephew of the infamous mobster James “Whitey” Bulger).

In 2013, Hunter Biden flew to China with his dad on Air Force Two. Within two weeks, Rosemont secured what eventually grew into a $1.5 billion private equity deal with a part of the Bank of China (which is owned by the Chinese Communist Party). So, as Schweizer put it, “the Chinese government-funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president.”

Interestingly, Schweizer wrote that the Thornton Group only touted its China meetings on its Chinese language website, saying “Chinese executives ‘extended their warm welcome’ to the ‘Thornton Group, with its US partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden (second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden).’ The purpose of the meetings was to ‘explore the possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity.’

One of these meetings between Hunter Biden’s company and Chinese officials happened on the same day Vice President Biden met with then-Chinese President Hu Jintao in Washington as part of the Nuclear Security Summit. And this was the rule rather than the exception.

Schweizer pointed out several more instances where Vice President Biden’s official business intersected with Hunter Biden’s private business. As he pointed out:

Twelve days after Hunter flew on Air Force Two to Beijing, Rosemont and the Bank of China entered “a first-of-its-kind investment fund” called Bohai Harvest RST (BHR).

In December 2014, the Chinese state-backed company Gemini Investments Limited made a $34 million investment into a fund managed by Rosemont.

In August 2014, Gemini Investments bought 75 percent of Rosemont Realty, a Rosemont Seneca sister company. The terms included a $3 billion commitment from the Chinese. The company then became Gemini Rosemont.

Finally, On April 16, 2014, Archer met with Vice President Biden at the White House. Five days later, Joe Biden met Ukrainian officials in Kiev about a United States Agency for International Development program to help the Ukrainian natural gas industry – including the promise of $1 billion in the U.S. and International Monetary Fund aid for Ukraine’s economy.

On April 22, 2014, Archer joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural-gas company.

On May 13, 2014, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board was announced. “Neither Hunter Biden nor Archer had any ground or experience in the energy sector.”

As Michael Kranish and David L. Stern wrote in The Washington Post on July 22, for more than 20 years, Hunter Biden’s professional career has followed his father’s political career, “from Washington to Ukraine to China.”

Speaker Pelosi has raised the correct standard that in America no one is above the law. However, the person who may be found guilty by that standard is former Vice President Biden.

The litigation came a day after President Trump, seeking to turn the tables against Democrats as they pursue an impeachment inquiry, highlighted what he called Biden's own possible misconduct while in office.

“The latest assault on President Trump is an obvious attempt to protect Joe Biden from the corruption scandals involving his son,” Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement. “Judicial Watch’s latest lawsuit will be the first of many to try to get to the bottom of this influence-peddling scandal.”

Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where his son Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board reportedly paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise.

The former vice president specifically said he threatened to pull nearly $1 billion in Obama administration loan guarantees if Shokin wasn't fired, potentially crippling Ukraine's government.

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES

Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while critics charged that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.

Judicial Watch said it was pursuing from the State Department ""any and all records regarding, concerning, or related to Viktor Shokin’s investigation of [former Ukrainian energy official] Mykola Zlochevsky and Shokin’s resignation at Ukraine’s Prosecutor General.""

Additionally, the organization sought ""any and all records of communication between any official, employee, or representative of the Department of State and any official, employee, or representative of the Office of the Vice President regarding Viktor Shokin.""

The lawsuit came only after the State Department refused to turn over the records after receiving a request in May, according to Judicial Watch.

WHISTLEBLOWER SETS UP GOFUNDME, WANTS $100G

The State Department has not ""produced the requested records or demonstrated that the requested records are lawfully exempt from production .... notified [Judicial Watch] of the scope of any responsive records it intends to produce or withhold and the reasons for any withholdings ... or informed [Judicial Watch] that it may appeal any adequately specific, adverse determination,"" Judicial Watch said in its complaint.

Following Trump's fiery remarks in New York on Wednesday, political scientist Ian Bremmer argued that Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine -- rather than Biden's decision to force out Ukraine's prosecutor -- was the real scandal.

""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" Bremmer wrote.

And Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who has long publicly pushed Ukraine to look into the Bidens, echoed the president's call for ""transparency"" from the Biden in a series of social media posts -- and directly accused Biden of corruption..

""We know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family,"" Giuliani wrote on Twitter. ""But $3 to $4m more was laundered to Biden. So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry’s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew.""

He added: ""Biden should agree to release records to see if he flew Hunter to China in Dec. 2013 on AF 2 to facilitate Hunter’s sale of his office to China for a total of $1.5 billion. Is there any doubt that China paid it to compromise VP. But they bought another pol as well. Guess?""

The Trump attorney insisted Biden, one of the frontrunners for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has high-level help.

""Democrat party is covering up a pattern of corruption involving high level members of the Obama cabinet,"" Giuliani said. ""The multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play is mind boggling. Biden Family sale of office to Ukraine was not the only one or the most egregious. Slimy Joe is not alone."""

With evidence suggesting that Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine posed a conflict of interest for his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, some Biden defenders are deploying talking points meant to deflect from the troubling facts. But some of these talking points – regularly repeated in the news media – do not hold up to a fact check.

TRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT

Here are three talking points being used to defend the Bidens:

Point 1: There was an “absolute wall” between Hunter Biden’s business and Vice President Biden.

At a campaign stop last month, Joe Biden claimed to have an “absolute wall” between himself and his family’s business. He said: “There will be an absolute wall between personal and private [business interests] and the government.... That’s why I never talked with my son or my brother or anyone else – even distant family – about their business interests. Period.”

Biden’s “absolute wall” clearly has holes. In an interview with The New Yorker earlier this year, Hunter recalled discussing his work at Burisma, a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company, with his father on at least one occasion.

On a separate occasion, Devon Archer – Hunter’s longtime business partner and fellow Burisma director – met privately with Vice President Biden at the White House hours after first receiving payment from Burisma.

While in office, Vice President Biden was certainly aware of Hunter’s role at Burisma, because his office was specifically asked in 2014 about the potential conflict of interest. A spokesperson for vice president’s office defended Hunter’s right to do business in Ukraine as “a private citizen and a lawyer.""

Apparently, the potential conflict with U.S. foreign policy wasn’t sufficient reason to reign Hunter in. In fact, the younger Biden didn’t step down from Burisma until earlier this year – when it became an issue for his father’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

While in office, Vice President Biden was certainly aware of Hunter’s role at Burisma, because his office was specifically asked in 2014 about the potential conflict of interest

Point 2: The Burisma investigation doesn’t represent a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.

Burisma began paying Hunter Biden as a legal advisor after British authorities opened a corruption investigation into the company’s owner. Shortly afterward, Ukrainian authorities launched an investigation of their own.

Some in the media, such as the Washington Post’s fact-checker, have repeated the claim that the Burisma investigation had been “shelved” by late 2015, when Joe Biden called for the prosecutor in charge to be fired.

But according to Burisma’s own attorneys, the case was not formally closed until September 2016, months after the prosecutor was fired. Others, such as Transparency International, say the matter remained open until November 2016.

The truth is that the investigation continued for years after Hunter was hired, all while Vice President Biden played an active role in U.S. relations with Ukraine.

Point 3: This is all a phony scandal being stirred up by Trump’s allies.

Some news outlets have gone so far as to dismiss the entire Burisma story as baseless spin drummed up by the Trump campaign. In reality, the Burisma issue predates the Trump administration.

Long before Burisma emerged as a campaign issue, I published “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,” which detailed the extent of Biden corruption in Ukraine.

Prior to that, many of the same outlets now dismissing the allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine had been critical of Hunter’s work. Reporters from The New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal all wrote critically of Hunter’s new job.

Now, some of those same writers are accusing those currently examining and discussing Burisma of conducting a partisan smear.

Have the basic facts of the story changed since it was first reported? No – only the politics surrounding it.

Trump's efforts to solicit information on Biden appears to fall squarely into that category, and though sitting presidents cannot be charged with a criminal offense they can be impeached by Congress.

The party has worked tirelessly to create an issue worthy of impeaching the president—Russia collusion, obstruction of justice, Stormy Daniels, tax returns. This week Democrats jettisoned all that in favor of the only issue that implicates their own front-runner for the nomination. Genius.

The one person who has been as much in the news this week as Donald Trump is former Vice President Joe Biden. It’s a dubious accomplishment. The only way to discuss Mr. Trump’s nonsmoking-gun phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is to acknowledge the subject of the ruckus: Mr. Biden’s glaring conflicts of interest during his vice presidency vis-à-vis his son Hunter’s business interests. Since Democrats insist on making this all about Ukraine, get ready for daily new revelations about the young Mr. Biden’s questionable activities and “Quid Pro Joe’s” involvement.

This is why the former vice president’s promises that this scandal will fade are nonsense. True, the media is doing double-duty on his behalf. Its general line is that Mr. Biden’s conflicts are fine; asking about them is corrupt. We are seeing a lot of stories about how Democrats are determined not to let Republicans “Hillary” Mr. Biden—a historical rewrite that places the blame for Mrs. Clinton’s notorious ethical travails on her rivals. The “fact checkers” are out in force with soothing assurances that there’s no evidence any Biden broke the law.

The problem for Joe Biden is that outright criminality is not necessary for these stories to stink. The appearance of conflict of interest is bad enough, and there is plenty of it. Mr. Biden knew his son worked for Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, and knew the company faced scrutiny. He nonetheless in 2016 had the Ukrainian prosecutor who oversaw that investigation fired. In 2013 the vice president took Hunter on a government plane to China, where Hunter met with business associates, a moment that even a former senior Obama White House aide admitted in a July New Yorker profile “invited questions about whether [Hunter] ‘was leveraging access.’ ”

""These are very bad and dirty guys and Hunter Biden signs up and based on financial records... he kept that job from 2014 up until earlier this year,"" he said on ""The Brian Kilmeade Show."" ""So [Hunter Biden] basically took in about $3 million for a job that he had no background in and he was selling something. It was not his expertise. I think he was selling access and I think that he was selling the prospect that he was going to be helpful to the Ukrainians in the Obama administration.""

Hunter Biden was discovered to have ties to the Ukranian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which paid him $50,000 a month while it was under investigation for corruption. Media scrutiny of the connection intensified after President Trump was accused of committing an impeachable offense by asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS

""The larger issue here... is, why is it that Hunter Biden was allowed to get involved with a company that is as dirty and as crooked as Burisma?"" Schweizer asked.

""[Ukraine] is one of those countries that has been saddled with corruption, really since the fall of Communism -- even during the Communist period. So it's one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Burisma is one of the most corrupt companies in a country that is one of the most corrupt in the world. So it is a very bad actor,"" he said in the interview.

Schweizer said the issue of selling access is a bipartisan problem and claimed that regardless of party, this sort of behavior should not be tolerated by the American public.

""This has been a persistent problem with both Republicans and Democrats in Washington -- where they go to these countries around the world, where there's a lot of corruption and cronyism, and they cash in,"" he said. ""They sell access... And that's not something we want done in this country.""

""The notion that Trump should not mention Joe Biden's name in a phone conversation, and say 'Hey, can you just work with our attorney general to get to the bottom of what actually happened' -- that's a completely legitimate conversation to have,"" Schweizer added.

A whistleblower complaint released Thursday alleged that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room,"" the complaint says.

Asked Thursday night at a campaign event in New Hampshire whether the son or daughter of a vice president should have business dealings abroad, businessman Andrew Yang said, “It certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term. And that's really the way it would be under my administration,” he added.

But Yang said Friday in an interview with Fox News that his comments the previous night were not an implicit criticism of Biden.

“If you look at when he was vice president, were there any rules against your family members being on the boards of foreign companies? I believe there were not. So nothing was amiss,” he said.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet – in a interview published Thursday by Politico – said, ""I think it’d be better not to have that kind of arrangement.”

But Bennet said the issue of Biden and his son Hunter paled in comparison to what Trump did in a July phone call with Ukraine’s president.

“I think it is distracting us from where we should be focused, which is on Donald Trump's calling up a foreign leader and tell him to investigate one of his political opponents. No matter what Hunter Biden did, it is hard for me to imagine that it's not 1 million times more benign than that,” Bennet emphasized.

WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T LET THE CHILD OF HER VP SIT ON A FOREIGN COMPANY'S BOARD

On Wednesday, one of Biden's top rivals, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, quickly answered “no” when asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on a foreign firm's board.

Still, to date, none of the Democratic presidential candidates have played into the president’s playbook of trying to turn the tables on Biden over his son's work.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Questions have been raised by Republicans over how Biden pushed as vice president in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – as a matter of record, he had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office by other nations – was later dismissed.

Trump’s reelection campaign on Friday launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his actions.

GABBARD REVERSES COURSE, BACKS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Meanwhile, the entire field of Democratic presidential candidates is now fully supporting the House Democrats' move this week launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the Ukrainian scandal.

The final holdout in the record-setting roster of White House hopefuls – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – came on board on Friday."

Well, we now have the rough transcript for Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and it's clear that, once again, Democrats got ahead of the evidence.

Keep in mind, when this story broke, The Washington Post reported ""two former U.S. officials"" said ""Trump's interaction with the foreign leader included a 'promise' that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint.""

JESSICA TARLOV: TRUMP IS ABUSING HIS POWER FOR PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAIN

Well, it turns out Trump makes no ""promise"" anywhere in the transcript. He makes no threats, either. Indeed, it was Zelensky who raised the issue of investigating corruption, not Trump. ""We wanted to drain the swamp here in our country ... You are a great teacher for us and in that,"" he told the president.

NBC's Katy Tur claimed that the transcript showed Trump said, ""Will you do me a favor and investigate Vice President [Joe] Biden's son?"" No, he didn't. When Trump asked Zelensky to ""do us a favor,"" it had nothing to do with Biden.

According to the transcript, Trump was asking Zelensky to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe that is being led by U.S. Attorney John Durham, a career prosecutor.

A Justice Department spokesman says Durham is ""exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.""

In his complaint, the whistleblower (who admits ""I was not a direct witness to most of the events described"") describes Trump asking Zelensky to cooperate with this investigation as an effort ""to advance his personal interests."" That is ridiculous. Since when is it inappropriate for the president of the United States to ask a foreign leader to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation?

The transcript also backs up Trump's claim that he put a temporary hold on some U.S. military aid to Ukraine because he was concerned that the European allies were not doing enough. During the call, Trump tells Zelensky the United States is doing ""much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

Zelensky responds: ""Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100 percent, but actually 1,000 percent."" He tells Trump that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron ""are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine,"" and says that ""the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union.""

The whistleblower offers no evidence that Trump had any other motivation.

What about Biden? Multiple news reports suggested Trump ""repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden's son."" Turns out Trump only mentions Biden by name toward the end of the call.

Trump tells Zelensky: ""The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me.""

Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. But the reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used U.S. aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was ""normal"" and ""nobody pushed me.""

In the complaint, the whistleblower alleges that efforts by White House officials to ""lock down"" the transcript are evidence of presidential wrongdoing. Or maybe they are evidence officials did not want yet another presidential conversation to leak.

No president in modern times has seen more of his conversations with foreign leaders leak than Trump, including calls with Australian then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, British then-Prime Minister Theresa May, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Little wonder the administration takes measures to restrict access to transcripts of those conversations.

The irony is, thanks to Democrats' impeachment push, the president is going to get his investigation of Biden's son – except it won't be carried out by Ukraine, but by the U.S. Congress.

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And that is the president of the United States talking about the push for impeachment, there's inquiry on it (ph) right now. The story's raging on all these channels. And Brad Parscale, the man in charge of taking this information, the current state of the economy and the country, and getting the president four more years.

He is in charge of the Trump 2020 reelection campaign and he's walking his dog. So we're going to hear a slice of Brad Parscale's life as well as his profession.

Brad, thanks so much for doing this.

BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: Hey, Brian. How are you, bud?

KILMEADE: Good, good. So everyone's talking about the Democrats, they're energized because of this impeachment inquiry and what happened yesterday.

What has it done for Trump 2020?

PARSCALE: Well, I mean, I think one of the most amazing things is just the fundraising we've had in the last 48 hours. I mean, as soon as they -- they started this attack, I think Americans, and -- and Republicans, and supporters of the president all over the country, they started voting with their wallet.

And you know, this is the one thing they can do right now. They can donate. And we've had just thousands and thousands and nearly millions of dollars in donations come in (ph). Sometimes -- many first-time donors. To just see the hypocrisy and the things they're doing right now, and they're upset that their vote is being stolen.

KILMEADE: You know, there was a sense that the more you pushed on the -- if you pushed for impeachment after the Mueller probe, it was good for the president.

But this is something brand new, it's -- everything's happening quicker, maybe it's more understandable.

Does that worry you?

PARSCALE: No, I'm not worried at all. I'm actually -- if you -- if you saw my statements, I'm pretty confident.

Look, the president was sent there from the people to actually deal with this kind of, you know, corruption and to -- and to fight the swamp, and that's what he's doing.

He's doing exactly what the people sent him there to do. And I think -- I don't think one American is going punish him for that.

And the Democrats just know they can't beat him in 2020, so they want to try to use anything they can and lie and cheat to defeat it.

KILMEADE: And that is proof that you did tell the truth. You are walking your dog and he seemed to be startled by something.

PARSCALE: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

KILMEADE: We'll cover that story, get a correspondent on it.

A couple other things, how close -- have you been in touch with the president?

I will tell you my observation. He had an unbelievably productive United Nations series of meetings.

I know international relations don't usually mean poll numbers, but I think he was really disheartened in his final press conference. He was as subdued as I've (ph) seen him.

I know you could easily say I'm wrong, but you know him as well as anybody. Could you give insight (ph) --

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: Can you give me his mindset?

PARSCALE: So I think, first of all -- I mean, like -- you know, I think, like, Merkel and some of these people only did like two or three bilaterals.

I mean, this is how hard the president is working. He's, like, doing 10 -- 11, I think in one day. I mean, he -- he wants to do three times as much as anybody else, plus one.

And that's -- that's just his mindset. I've known him for so long. He always wants to do a little more. There's always more I can do today.

I talked about this from the last rallies, the last days of the 2016 election to U.N. meetings, he's a fighter and he wants to do more.

Look, I don't think he's -- I don't think he's stepped (ph) one step back from this.

He's -- as you saw yesterday in his -- in his -- in his press conference -- hey, sorry -- in his press conference that he's ready to fight.

And he wants to -- he wants to -- he wants to support the American people. Sorry. We're walking by a dog.

KILMEADE: No, I understand. What kind of dog do you have?

PARSCALE: I have -- I have two Labradoodles. My wife picked them out. They're like -- but (ph) they're labs and they just -- they're funny dogs.

KILMEADE: Right. I mean, did you hear the creator of the Labradoodle feels as though they created Frankenstein and they regret doing it?

(LAUGHTER)

PARSCALE: No, they're good dogs. One of them is 9-months-old though, so he gets a little frisky when he walks by dogs.

KILMEADE: The president's got an agenda left.

Number one, the USMCA, he's looking at some type of gun legislation. He -- the White House reached out to Senator Murphy.

He also -- there's talk about doing something on the vaping with the new revelations, and the -- and the 12 deaths and the 400 who've been sickened.

What -- what do you want him -- just from a pure pollster perspective, what do you want to see him tackle?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think one thing everybody needs to understand with this president, he's about personal freedom. You know, like he's going to -- he's going to protect the Second Amendment. He's always going to do that.

He's going to protect the personal freedom of you to -- you know, to vape. I think those are things that he wants. He wants to make sure -- but he also cares about people's safety and children. And I think he's -- he's bothered personally by, you know, some of the young people that have been affected by this.

But overall, everything about him is about personal freedom. And we're the party of freedom. And the other party wants to take things away and control what you can and can't do, from -- even if that's a plastic straw in your -- in your drink.

They want to tell you how to live -- they want -- how much sugar you can have, everything else.

We believe that -- and I -- and I truly believe the Republican Party is the party of freedom.

KILMEADE: So you think cracking down with kids under 18, but letting people do what they want to do. Whether it's chewing tobacco, smoking, smoking cigars, you don't want to touch that. But you do -- you would -- you would like to see him maybe go into the education of the high schools and controlling these companies from advertising?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think -- I think we always as adults have to protect our children. But yes, I also don't think that -- you know, I think protecting personal freedom is very important.

And it's why -- you know when I -- when I got into this -- I was in politics before this, when I started seeing the Democrats just want to tell us how we live, what we do, everything -- they control it (ph) because they're smarter than us.

I just knew that President Trump was the right person was the right person to make sure that we're protected. And he's going to do that. He's going to protect our Second Amendment also.

KILMEADE: Brad Parscale in charge of Trump 2020 has been working extremely hard with some very unique, cutting-edge ways of doing it.

Number one is setting up a monster list of anyone who's ever gone to a rally or expressed interest. They're on his tweet list or his text list.

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: So Brad, guns is a dicey issue, and I understand there's some friction in the House -- within the White House in that the suburban moms are now for the first time in favor of some type of legislation that might make their kids at school safer and their community safer. And we also know how much the NRA and gun rights Second Amendment means to Republicans.

Is there a sweet spot?

PARSCALE: Look, I mean that's something for the White House to talk about. I don't -- I'm not going to get into legislation with you.

But, like, I think that -- I think this electorate and the people who are going to come out and vote for Donald Trump just want to make sure that they don't start down a slippery slope of trying to remove their personal freedoms.

And I think the president's going to protect that at all costs. While at the same time --

KILMEADE: When you -- right.

PARSCALE: -- he wants to protect the -- I mean, he wants to protect children. He wants to do what's -- he wants to do it (ph) right.

And doing what Beto wants to do and come take guns is the craziest thing ever. And that's not how we make our -- our world safer. That's just -- that's just psychotic talk.

KILMEADE: The emergence of Warren over Biden, does that make you happier?

PARSCALE: Look, I think -- I think Warren is -- I think Warren's continuing to rise. I think she's -- she will be the nominee, that -- I have said that for, I think, five months and people thought I was crazy.

And if you look at the trends, she continues to rise while he continues to fall. And I -- and I think this -- you know, the corruption of Hunter Biden and what happened with, you know, getting millions from China and Ukraine and everywhere else while his father is the vice president.

You know - the millions (ph) - the Biden's have made (ph) office is a corruptional -- take them down Democrat Party. I've always said he was never going to increase one point. He was only going to decrease.

Since -- since his announcement, he's never gone up one point. I think he's only gone down. And that's what Biden does every time he's ever run.

(CROSSTALK)

KILMEADE: I want you to hear what Jim Cramer said yesterday on CNBC about Elizabeth Warren, cut 41.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think Elizabeth Warren pushes banks into - they were already down 20 percent from behind (ph).

JIM CRAMER, CNBC: I don't what's going happen. Look, I've got to tell you, when you get off the desk and you talk to executives, they're more fearful of her winning.

I mean I've never heard anybody say look, she's got to be stopped, she's got to be stopped. I don't know. She's very - she keeps going up in the polls.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's raised a ton of money.

CRAMER: She's going to win Iowa I believe. She's a very compelling figure on the stump (ph).

(END AUDIO CLIP)

KILMEADE: And she (ph) -- said he went on to say that if he wins he has people that (ph) go to - they're going to vote Trump that normally would not. That's how much --

PARSCALE: I 100 percent agree. Look, I think the president beats Warren handedly (ph).

But I think the progressive left, the Democrat Party, the establishment that's there -- whether that's in the actual votes or in the convention or whatever -- they want Warren to win.

This is what they want, they want a progressive woman to win, and I think that's where they're going. And I think that's what the party wants also.

I think Biden is being - he's going to be (ph) attacked from both sides.

KILMEADE: He is, and it looks like you want Warren to win too. Brad Parscale thanks for your dog walking time. We appreciate it.

PARSCALE: Thank you buddy (ph).

KILMEADE: You got it. Brian Kilmeade Show, Brad Parscale from 2020."

Watters and his fellow co-hosts were reacting to a press conference given by Trump in New York hours after a transcript of the phone call was released by the White House.

Trump told reporters he wants ""full transparency"" regarding the ""so-called whistleblower"" allegations leveled against him, but also ""from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.""

Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry Tuesday following the whistleblower's complaint that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden. Zelensky, speaking while sitting with Trump at a bilateral meeting on the sideline of the United Nations Gereral Assembly Wednesday, told reporters he did not feel ""pushed"" at all in his conversations with the president.

Watters argued that Democrats believe Biden is ""above the law"" and are accusing Trump of the crimes actually committed by the former vice president.

""So at this point, the Democrats are accusing Trump of crimes they committed,"" Watters said.

Dana Perino later asked co-host Juan Williams if Democrats were premature in their announcement of an impeachment inquiry.

Williams said he agreed with the stance taken by the Democratic Party, before mentioning that the White House had accidentally sent talking points on the transcript to Democrats and sparking a reaction from Watters and co-host Greg Gutfeld.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Sen. Warren, D-Mass., stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with former Vice President Joe Biden commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Trump told MacCallum she didn't know that many people who could ""stand to vote for her.""

MARC THIESSEN: DEM IMPEACHMENT ACCUSATIONS AGAINST TRUMP NOT SUPPORTED BY TRANSCRIPT OF TRUMP-ZELENSKY CALL

As you consider the actions of Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Nadler, Adam Schiff and others, here are the 10 things you need to know about the Ukraine construct they are using to justify their latest actions.

1. Democrats think Joe Biden is immune. The Democrats are saying that the Trump White House and Department of Justice cannot get information from the Ukraine on Biden because he is running for president and therefore is Trump's rival. By their logic, therefore, Joe Biden is immune from a federal investigation while he runs for office against President Trump. How very convenient and absurd.

2. We now know that contrary to news reports and Democrats talking points, the Trump call transcript does NOT indicate Trump withheld aid in exchange for election help against Biden. There was no quid pro quo. The Democrats sold a false story.

The D.C. Democrats want to impeach Trump for activities that pale in comparison to what people in their party have been doing for years.

3. The Trump call transcript also indicates that the current Ukraine government is more than troubled about the Bidens' actions vis-a-vis the Ukraine and on their own is continuing to investigate that activity. In addition to that, the President of Ukraine continues to say there was no pressure from Trump to do anything related to that investigation.

4. A non-tortured reading of the Trump call transcript indicates that Trump asked for assistance with an ongoing DOJ investigation, which, Andrew McCarthy rightly said, is not a violation of the law. Indeed, there is a treaty between the U.S. and the Ukraine that was signed by President Bill Clinton that is entitled the Treaty with Ukraine on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. That treaty binds the respective countries to provide ""documents, records and other items"" to each other upon request.

5. “Ukrainian prosecutors say they have tried to get this information to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) since the summer of 2018, fearing it might be evidence of possible violations of U.S. ethics laws” related to the Bidens.

In other words, long before Trump made a call, the Ukraine wanted to provide the U.S. information on the Bidens.

6. The Obama administration pressured “Ukraine’s prosecutors to drop an investigation into the Burisma Holdings gas company that employed Hunter Biden and to look for new evidence in a then-dormant criminal case against eventual Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, a GOP lobbyist.”

7. The Obama White House and DNC directly solicited Ukrainian officialsto get involved in the 2016 campaign by asking for dirt on Manafort and by asking Ukrainian President to speak on U.S. soil negatively about Paul Manafort. That is far worse than what the Democrat allege Trump to have done.

8. Hunter Biden, who is generally incompetent and was kicked out of the Navy for drug use, made millions off contemporaneous to trips he made with his father when Biden was VP. The Democrats see no problem with that. Imagine if Donald Trump Jr. did that. Those payments absolutely were made to buy influence in the Obama Administration and are more than likely at the center of the Ukrainian prosecutor, that Joe Biden got fired after saying he would withhold aid, “was making plans to question Hunter Biden about $3 million in fees that Biden and his partner, Archer, collected from Burisma through their American firm.” According to that prosecutor: “The truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors.”

9. The so-called whistleblower was fed the information by others and his attorney worked for Hillary and Schumer. Doesn’t that sound non-biased to you?

10. Finally, anyone on TV who jumped to the conclusion that Trump broke the law was trying to make a headline not a reasoned judgment with all the facts.

In short, the D.C. Democrats want to impeach Trump for activities that pale in comparison to what people in their party has been doing for years.

That is par for the course from them these days and a disgrace to the Constitution.

Cory Booker slammed President Trump on Thursday, calling President Trump’s urging the Ukraine leader to investigate the Biden family “despicable behavior.”

The Democrat from New Jersey also termed “the revelations” from the whistleblower in the Ukraine controversy “explosive.”

BOOKER DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S UKRAINE TIES

But Booker emphasized that even though “we are in a constitutionally challenging moment” with an impeachment inquiry in Congress underway, he didn’t believe the White House race would become all about the Trump presidency.

Booker spoke with reporters following a campaign event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire soon after an unclassified version of the complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower was released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning.

The unidentified whistleblower claimed that White House officials who listened to the call in July between the president and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's requests that Zelensky investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

The president on Thursday called the whistleblower report “another fake news story” and “another witch hunt” by the Democrats.

Booker claimed that the president was using “the highest office in the land.. for his own personal political agenda” and emphasized that “we are seeing evidence of that in this whistleblower report.”

And he spotlighted that “clearly there's more work to be done. There needs to be a thorough investigation.”

An optimistic Booker predicted that the Republican-controlled Senate “will investigate as well…there’s already been shown some good bipartisan efforts to get to the truth.”

Slamming congressional Democrats, Trump on Thursday charged “they’re going to tie up our country. We can’t talk about gun regulation. We can’t talk about anything. Frankly they’re so tied up. They so screwed up. Nothing gets done.”

But Booker – while acknowledging that “there’s gonna be a lot of wind sucked off the sails” – added, “do not underestimate the ability for us to get things done in Washington when…we start to build relationships to get things done.”

Booker, emphasizing that the presidential election needed to be more than just about Trump, told Fox News “Americans are far more sophisticated… the United States is in peril, because of corruption. But we can also deal with other issues.”

Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, “I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.”

But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, “no.”

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT IN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: “I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.”

The ""details"" to which Warren was referring are from the two ethics plans she's unveiled to tackle corruption in government. Her campaign later clarified to the Washington Post that the plans wouldn't prevent any child of a vice president from serving on such a board.

Warren’s comments came hours after the White House released a transcript of Trump’s call from this past July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The readout showed that the president asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Biden family’s dealings with Ukraine. However, the transcript did not suggest Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine to obtain a “promise” of an investigation.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

TRUMP TRIES TO TURN TABLES ON DEMOCRATS IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

Trump on Wednesday emphasized that there was no quid pro quo during his call with the Ukrainian president, saying, “I didn’t do it.” Trump spoke with reporters one day after House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment inquiry. They’re investigating whether the Republican president broke the law by allegedly asking a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 election by asking for Ukraine’s assistance in investigating the Bidens.

Warren kicked off her event – in front of a crowd estimated at 900 people by her campaign – by emphasizing, “nobody’s above the law... not even the president.” And, she repeated her call that “it is time for impeachment now.”

The Massachusetts senator was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call for Trump’s impeachment. She did it this past spring, citing findings from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report.

Asked if she had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would take action if the House impeached Trump, Warren told reporters, “I don’t know what the Senate will do under (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnel’s control, but right now we have to do what is right regardless of the politics.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

She continued, “Donald Trump had established he believed that he was above the law, and that’s what the Mueller report shows, that he obstructed justice, and he was not held accountable by our Congress. So, he came back in the summer and did it again, inviting a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election.”

Warren’s stop in New Hampshire came a day after a new poll indicated that she held a slight two-point advantage over Biden in the crucial primary state.

For example, remember the latest New York Times hit piece on Brett Kavanaugh? The one where they found a brand new accusation of sexual misconduct, but then later had to admit it was all a sham? When did that happen? It feels like about a year ago, but actually, no, it was just last week.

That's the Trump-era news cycle for you. Scandals that used to go on for months now seem to end in hours. Nothing illustrates that better than this bizarre Ukraine story that we're all living through.

NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMS FEAR BLOWBACK FROM IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: REPORT

So, a week ago, no one had even heard of it. By Tuesday night, we were on the brink of impeachment because of it. And now, it seems to be over already.

Just to bring you back and remind you what just happened: the same angry news anchors who brought you Stormy Daniels and the Russia hoax now wanted you to know that Big Orange's days in the White House were finally over.

Why? Because Trump, they said, threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine. And it's essential that we send military aid to Ukraine for some reason. But Trump was going to withhold it unless they did something bad to Joe Biden and his family.

Basically, it was an extortion plot against Ukraine, and that's a crime, the news anchors shouted. A crime! Trump was finished!

Well, Wednesday morning, they turned out to be wrong. Actual evidence emerged. And it contradicted what they told us yesterday. The administration released a transcript of the president's phone call with Ukrainian head of state, and it shows none of the things that news anchors claimed it would show. Read it for yourself, don't trust us. It's right online.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Try to find the extortion in there; there isn't any. Trump never even mentions military aid. Well, yes, they're saying now, but he asked a foreign government to investigate an American citizen and that is immoral.

OK. Was it immoral when three Democratic senators wrote a letter to Ukraine just last year, demanding investigations into Trump? No answer on that question. Well, we will tell you if we hear back.

Instead, now they're telling us that the transcript of the phone call can't be real. It must be doctored. Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff spun their conspiracy theory on Tuesday night.

Chris Hayes, MSNBC host: Do you trust the White House enough to take that transcript and believe that that is an actual representation of what transpired?

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: Well, you know, I think, sadly, it is the case as you described that we cannot trust the administration with respect to anything that it produces.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.: Simply to release the transcript is not going to come close to ending the need of the American public and the Congress to see what actually happened.

So again, that was last night, before the transcript was publicly available. Now that it is publicly available for Adam Schiff's conspiracy addled brain, it has lurched in a different direction. Now he is telling us that the transcript, the one that he has already denounced as fake, is, in fact, real. But it doesn't show what it should show -- which is to say it doesn't show President Trump doing any of the things that supposedly justify impeachment. Why?

Well, Adam Schiff explains because the president, like a Navajo code talker, is speaking in secret code.

If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's alleged corruption. That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really.

""This is how a mafia boss talks,"" Schiff told reporters. ""What have you done for us? We've done so much for you. But there's not much reciprocity. I have a favor I want to ask you. And what is that favor? Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. A classic mafia-like shakedown a foreign leader.""

So, you know, we're not psychiatrists here. But honestly, Adam Schiff is a nut case. It's true. It's hard to believe he is in Congress. Poor people of Anaheim, or wherever he is from -- Southern California, the Valley somewhere. It's hard to believe he is actually in Congress.

He is actually a committee chairman, believe it or not. Too bad the 25th Amendment doesn't apply to members of Congress.

But to be fair, most Democrats are not anywhere near as crazy as Adam Schiff, not even the same ballpark. They're just very cynical -- extremely cynical -- more cynical you've ever thought of being.

For example, this is illustrated when Congressman Al Green, who is not stupid or crazy, explains what's actually driving impeachment against Trump.

Interviewer: Are you concerned that impeachment talk may actually help the president's reelection?

Rep. Al Green, D-Texas: I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected.

""I'm concerned if we don't impeach, he will get reelected."" I'm concerned that democracy could happen. We've got to stop that.

It's about power. Duh. You knew that. That's what it's always about, power.

Nobody pushing for impeachment actually cares about secret deals with foreign leaders. Oh, please. Much less justice or the truth. Again, these are the most cynical people in the United States of America.

What they care about -- and you knew this already -- was winning the 2020 presidential election. That's all they care about. Getting their mitts on the levers of power and exercising power for its own sake. That's what drives them. That's why they get up in the morning.

Democratic leaders have decided that impeaching Trump is essential if they're going to win next year. So they're staking everything on this bizarre, flimsy scandal that the rest of us can barely even understand. Will it work? Probably not.

If personal attacks on Trump are effective -- if calling him a racist or a traitor actually worked -- then Hillary Clinton would be running for reelection right about now. That is not going to work. It never works.

If you want to impeach Trump, make a case on the issues. He won on the issues. Make a counter case. The geniuses can't figure that out.

In the end, the real loser here in this impeachment nonsense is likely to be Joe Biden. Biden, you'll recall, is the frontrunner, supposedly. He is supposed to be the safe choice, the guy who is going to energize the Obama coalition and win back the White House.

And yet now Democrats have, in effect, demanded that we spend the next six months talking about Biden and his son's alleged corruption because that's at the core of this Ukraine story. If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's alleged corruption.

That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really.

They must have gamed this out. They must know. Is it sabotage? Well, honestly, we don't know. We're not in the room. Maybe it is.

Or maybe Democrats have just become so obsessed with destroying Donald Trump, that they're destroying themselves accidentally.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced Congress is launching an impeachment inquiry this week over a whistleblower complaint alleging President Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate potential wrongdoing by Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in the country."

NBC News summarized what the public learned this morning:

The whistleblower says White House officials told them the conversation on July 25 between Trump and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] was removed from the computer system that is typically used for such records of calls with foreign leaders. Instead, the whistleblower writes, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is used only for information that is of an “especially sensitive nature.” One White House official described that as an abuse of the secure system because there was nothing “remotely sensitive” on the phone call from a national security perspective, the whistleblower said. According to White House officials the whistleblower spoke with, that was “not the first time” the Trump administration placed a presidential transcript “into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive – rather than national security sensitive – information.”

The same whistleblower complaint said there was a “word-for-word transcript” of the call, which was among the records that Trump aides intervened to “lock down.”

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who routinely votes with the White House’s position, has already downplayed the significance of the broader scandal and has even suggested he wants to use his gavel to investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 race.

But even Johnson isn’t fully comfortable with this detail from the whistleblower’s complaint [Update: see below].

“I would not be happy. We’ll find out exactly what transpired here. To me, of all this stuff, that’s the part that concerns me,” Johnson told Politico this morning. He added, “I was led to believe [that summary] was all that’s available. I would be a little upset to find out there’s a completely verbatim one.”

That, of course, is a thread worth pulling on. Indeed, if there’s a “word-for-word transcript” of the call, when will that be released? How much worse might it make the president look? Why was it hidden? At whose direction?

When yesterday’s rough transcript was released, the New York Times told readers the document was “developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with experts and note takers listening.” Of course, voice recognition software is dependent on audio, which further raises the possibility of recorded tapes.

To be sure, the version of the Trump/Zelensky conversation that the world saw yesterday was deeply unflattering – and it vastly increased the odds that the Republican will be impeached in the coming months. But there were curious ellipses in key sections.

If there’s a more complete and more accurate version of the phone meeting, circumstances suggest the White House has a responsibility to disclose it, too.

Update: It looks like Johnson changed his mind after making these comments, concluding, “My concerns were satisfied.”"

TRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMOCRATS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT

The whistleblower complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, alleges that White House officials said they were “directed” by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept.

The whistleblower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower also said that, according to White House officials, it was “not the first time” a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information. The complaint alleged that the White House tried to “restrict access” to records of the call.

“In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down’ all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced—as customary—by the White House Situation Room,” the whistleblower stated.

The White House released an unclassified version of that transcript of the call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there is a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” he said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it…sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings—where his son, Hunter Biden, was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

But the whistleblower’s complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that the concerns were based on second-hand information.

The White House lawyers’ directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top Democrats as a “cover-up.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was prompted by Ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, called the move a “cover-up” and said it would be part of the impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow downplayed the importance of the record-keeping details.

“A cover-up? Think about that for a moment,"" Sekulow said on “Fox & Friends” Friday. ""The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It’s so secret and such a cover-up, here’s the documents. This is nonsense.”

So far the only inappropriate behavior that I'm seeing in this entire thing is that of Vice President Joe Biden, in order to help his son.""

Sanders likened the recent impeachment push by Democrats to the Russia investigation and accused them of using a ""fake scandal"" to dupe American voters and regain executive power.

""This is exactly out of the Democrats' playbook,"" she said. ""They used a fake scandal with Russia. Now they're trying to create a fake scandal with Ukraine. It doesn't matter who the actors are. The real bad players in this whole process are the Democrats, trying to fool American voters.

""The good thing is, the American voters are far too smart to fall for the Democrat lies,"" Sanders continued. ""I think one of the best things that's coming out of this is the contrast of who is showing up to be fit to lead our country in a very trying time.""

Sanders also said the Democratic Party has become so anti-Trump, they're willing to hurt the country if it means hurting the president.

""Time and time again the Democrats show their true colors. They don't care about the country,"" she added. ""They care about tearing the president down. They've completely lost sight of what is important and are singularly focused on making sure they destroy the president and win reelection.""

Sanders spoke shortly before the public release of a whistleblower complaint involving Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

But after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated.

READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT

Maguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint itself that was released publicly Thursday morning, and said it's up to them to decide how to proceed.

“The horse has left the barn,” Maguire said. “You have all of the information. You have the whistleblower complaint. You have the letter from the ICIG. You have the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and you have the transcript from the president.”

Maguire also stressed that the complaint was essentially ""hearsay"" and not “corroborated by other folks.”

“This is second-hand information. I am not criticizing the whistleblower,” Maguire said. “... I am in no position to tell the committee to do an investigation or not to do an investigation.”

Schiff vowed at the end ""we are gonna find out"" the backstory, including whether U.S. aid was tied in any way to Trump's investigation request, which the president denies.

The combative conclusion of the session reflected the high tensions and enormous stakes surrounding Maguire's appearance. The rare open hearing of the intelligence committee commanded Washington's political attention given the implications for the newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump, related to the whistleblower complaint.

Shortly after the hearing ended, Trump fired back on Twitter, saying: “Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!”

He told reporters that the process is a “disgrace,” defended his Ukraine call as “absolutely perfect” and accused Democrats of bringing any legislative progress to a standstill.

“They’re frozen, the Democrats,” he said.

Maguire's reputation was also on trial Thursday. He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.

Maguire insisted he is ""not partisan"" and ""not political,"" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times.

""I have served and led through turbulent times,"" he said. ""... My integrity has never been questioned until now.""

However, he maintained, ""I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times.”

At one point in the hearing, during a tense exchange with Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., about allegations in the complaint of a potential “cover-up” regarding the Ukraine call, Maguire pushed back again by reminding the committee that the complaint was not based on direct knowledge.

“This is second-hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge if that is a true and accurate statement,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim. The complaint said White House officials tried to “lock down” records of the call. In the same document, the whistleblower also acknowledged not being a “direct witness” to most of the events described, instead citing other U.S. officials who are not named.

Republican members also jumped to Maguire's defense at the hearing, while accusing Democrats of launching an ""information warfare operation"" against Trump. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said of Maguire: ""I think you're nuts if you're going to convince the American people that your cause is just by attacking this man, by impugning his character.""

Schiff, meanwhile, questioned Maguire over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee. Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues. He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such ""complicated and sensitive issues.""

""I believe that this matter is unprecedented,"" he testified. He also said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, but said he or she acted in ""good faith.""

Maguire maintained that he was ""not stonewalling"" despite the delay in the release of the complaint to the committee, but following ""the law the way it was written, not the law as people might wish it to be."" Maguire again explained that he was required to review the complaint for executive privilege.

""It took longer than I would have liked,"" he said. ""But once the transcripts were released, no longer was there an issue of executive privilege ... so then I was able to release the information to you.""

He added: ""At no time did I ever try to withhold information.""

The complaint cites “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call"" between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and accuses Trump of attempting “to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.” It also presents allegations that the White House tried to ""restrict access"" to records of the call.

The complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were ""directed"" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information.

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS

Meanwhile, Republicans on the committee, including Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused Democrats of orchestrating a public spectacle.

""I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president, and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,"" Nunes said, adding that “we’ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases, press conferences, and fake news stories.”

""The released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion, but that didn't matter,"" he continued. ""The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn't need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president.""

The White House, on Wednesday, released an unclassified version of the transcript of that controversial phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.

Maguire says that the whistleblower complaint released Thursday ""is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.""

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.

Hours after the transcript was released, Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Reporters asked Zelensky about the call with Trump, and whether he felt pressured by the U.S. president, as alleged by the whistleblower—an accusation he denied.

“I think you read everything. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,” he said. “We had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.”

He added: “I think you read it that nobody pushed me.”

Republicans have also raised concerns about the whistleblower's possible ""political bias,"" as the intelligence community inspector general found indications the whistleblower was ""in favor of a rival political candidate"" of Trump.

Whistleblower complaint on Trump-Ukraine call declassified, contains 'no surprises,' GOP lawmaker says

Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart announced on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" and on social media late Wednesday that the explosive whistleblower complaint concerning President Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader has been declassified -- and Stewart said that it doesn't contain any damning information. ""The entirety of it is focused on this one thing, and that's the transcript of one phone call,"" he said. Stewart added that he was initially ""anxious"" before viewing the complaint but concluded ""this is going to go nowhere. ... there are just no surprises there.""

Stewart was among bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate who gained access to the whistleblower complaint in a classified setting on Wednesday. House Democrats emerging from a secure room would not divulge details of the document, but described it as disturbing and urgent. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said it ""exposed serious wrongdoing."" The complaint was not immediately available to the public but was expected to be released Thursday morning. Click here for more on our top story.

Acting Director of National Intelligence to testify before Congress on whistleblower complaint

Rep. Stewart's claim came hours before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was set to testify before Congress on Thursday. On Wednesday, Maguire denied a Washington Post report that he had threatened to turn in his resignation over concerns that the White House might try to make him stonewall Congress over the whistleblower controversy. Meanwhile, Fox News is told there was serious conversation among lawmakers as to how far Maguire could go in an open session at the hearing. One source tells Fox News the administration may have declassified the document so it could be discussed publicly during the hearing.

Read the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian president

The White House on Wednesday released a declassified transcript of President Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It showed that Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. The president made the request on the call only after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike.

Multiple news outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, and the Washington Post, inaccurately reported that the ""favor"" related specifically to investigating Biden. The transcript also did not show that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in the Post had claimed. Click here to read the transcript.

Trump demands 'full transparency' over whistleblower allegations -- and from Joe Biden

A defiant President Trump said during a press conference in New York Wednesday that he wants ""full transparency"" not only over the ""so-called whistleblower"" allegations leveled against him, but also ""from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China."" Trump also demanded ""transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president ... to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.""

The president's comments signaled that the White House would seek to turn the tables against Democrats who have initiated a formal impeachment inquiry. Biden, Trump's potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election, said the allegations against the president are impeachable, but his job is to ""beat him"" in the election.

Army warns soldiers to be ready for potential violence by 'incels' at 'Joker' screenings: reports

Military commanders are warning service members about the potential for mass shootings at screenings of the upcoming film ""Joker"", according to media reports. The Army issued a Sept. 18 memo in response to social media posts from so-called ""incels"" that were uncovered by the FBI, the website said.

Incels are part of a subculture that identifies as involuntarily celibate, meaning they are unable to find romantic partners even though they desire one. The memo said incels “idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the Batman series, admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to be happy, but eventually fights back against bullies.” Click here to read more.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

Earlier this month Warren landed the endorsement of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

KARL ROVE: PELOSI WAS FORCED TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Trump's July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered a whistleblower complaint that touched off a political tempest in Washington, D.C. The complaint was released publicly Thursday, alleging Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

Some Democrats allege Trump implicitly sought a quid pro quo - by trying to trade U.S. military aid for dirt on Biden - but the White House has vigorously denied it.

Cruz said House Democrats are still angry about the 2016 election and are doing everything they can to uproot the president from office.

“Who’s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to spy,” Trump said in audio obtained by the Los Angeles Times from a private event with diplomatic officials in New York. “You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

The comments led several Democratic house committee members to accuse Trump of “witness intimidation.”

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN 'INTERFERENCE' IN ELECTION

“That kind of incitement to violence is only going to chill other witnesses when they come forward,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said, according to The Times. “And that is its very intent, to intimidate the witnesses.""

The whistleblower, in a complaint declassified Thursday, said they were not a “direct witness” to most of the events in the complaint, but wrote that they had received information from more than half a dozen White Hosue and other U.S. government officials who alleged Trump “is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

The complaint was turned over to the Inspector General who found it credible and of urgent concern but it was not initially shared with Congress.

The allegations center on a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

The president beat them at their own game by choosing to be completely transparent with the American people. In releasing the transcript of his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump showed that he had nothing to hide.

Contrary to hysterical media reports, there was no “quid pro quo.” There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever. And Joe Biden was barely given a mention over the course of 30 minutes. In fact, his name came up just once.

GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG – STILL, PELOSI AND HER COLLEAGUES WILL DO ANYTHING TO UNDO 2016

What really debunks the Democrats’ and the media’s narrative is what Trump legitimately asked for: help with the ongoing investigation by the attorney general into the corrupt origins of the Russia investigation and Ukraine’s involvement in it.

Given the Democrats’ obsession with election meddling in 2016, their sudden lack of interest in getting to the bottom of what happened is hypocritical at best. They’ve made it clear that they were never interested in investigating the integrity of our democratic process. They are only interested in baseless investigations of the president.

Two years later, nothing has changed.

As we expected, the Democrats’ baseless claims that Trump enlisted Ukraine in his reelection efforts were proven false. The president only mentioned Biden in passing during the phone call.

Contrary to hysterical media reports, there was no “quid pro quo.” There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever.

Biden, on the other hand, was caught on tape bragging about threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless it ired the prosecutor tasked with investigating Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month as a board member. Talk about “quid pro quo.” Trump merely noted on the matter in his phone call with Zelensky, “It sounds horrible to me.”

The Department of Justice also found there was no merit to an alleged campaign finance violation during the call. This is unsurprising, given the initial complaint that kicked off the latest media anti-Trump spasm came from a whistleblower with “political bias” represented by a Democratic attorney.

Enlisting foreign nationals to do your dirty work is a page right out of the Democrats’ playbook. Just as the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton paid for disinformation on Trump from Russian sources, it was the Democrats who asked Ukraine for help to “sabotage Trump” in 2016.

On the roster: Dems look to streamline impeachment probe - Team Trump leans on Mueller moves - Joe = Jeb? Biden benefactors ready to mobilize mega PAC - A little on the nose, don’t you think?



DEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”

TIME OUT: MAN, HOLES

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

A LITTLE ON THE NOSE, DON’T YOU THINK?

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”

Pelosi spoke to reporters after the release of a whistleblower complaint regarding Trump’s July call with Zelensky. The complaint said officials tried to ""lock down"" records of the call, in which Trump sought Ukraine's help investigating the Biden family.

“This is a cover up,” Pelosi said. “Here we are with another example of the disregard for the Constitution by the president.”

READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT

Pelosi added: “When you have a system for electronic storage that is specifically not used and you have something that is politically helpful for the president and you hide it someplace else, that is a cover-up.”

During a separate hearing on Capitol Hill, however, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire cautioned against jumping to conclusions on allegations of a ""cover-up"" and more, noting the complaint was not based on direct knowledge.

“This is second-hand information from a whistleblower,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim.

Pelosi’s comments come as the unnamed whistleblower’s complaints were made public, two days after she announced that the House was opening a formal impeachment inquiry over the issue.

The complaint alleges Trump abused the power of his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in next year's U.S. election.

On the call, Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE

Trump has denied doing anything wrong and says the record of the call, which was released publicly on Wednesday, vindicates him of any wrongdoing.

“The president thinks this proves his innocence, which only shows how much he doesn’t understand right from wrong,” Pelosi said.

The House speaker has for months brushed off calls from her party’s more liberal members to open impeachment proceedings against Trump, but Thursday she bristled at the assertion that she had changed her mind about going forward.

“We wanted to have a fuller understanding of the facts,” she said. “I didn’t change my mind.”

“The president of the United States and his actions with a telephone call with another head of state betrayed his oath of office,” Pelosi added. “We have to have an inquiry to further the facts.”

As of Wednesday, a majority of House members have publicly supported impeachment proceedings against Trump, with 217 Democrats and independent Rep. Justin Amash all being in favor of opening the inquiry into the president.

One House member not supporting the impeachment push is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who in his weekly press briefing said that Pelosi opened the inquiry without any evidence against Trump.

""She opened [an] impeachment inquiry without even seeing one word of evidence,"" he said. ""[E]ven her own members questioned that she moved too soon. And when the evidence was released the Democrats, and many of the media, twisted it to what they wanted to believe.""

Before the recent scandal involving the phone call with the Ukrainian president, numerous Democrats had pushed impeachment proceedings or even outright impeachment – mostly over the results of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump campaign links to Russia and whether Trump attempted to obstruct the probe.

That probe did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction issue and did not find evidence of collusion. Pelosi’s statement earlier in the week marks the first time Democratic Party leadership has gotten behind the impeachment effort."

""There was sort of an air of unreality about it because the complaint and the transcript, the partial transcript, have now been turned over,"" he said. ""So the fight didn’t really have that much juice to it. But that was really what the issue was about.""

Toobin also defended acting Director of Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who told the committee he may have been given bad advice from the Department of Justice or the White House as to how to handle the whistleblower complaint levied against the president.

""The issue that the Democrats, in particular, were focusing on is why when the law says when there is a credible and urgent inspector general’s report — when the law says it shall be turned over to the Congress, why wasn’t it turned over right away?"" Toobin asked.

SCHWEIZER: HUNTER BIDEN 'WAS SELLING ACCESS' TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, WAS INVOLVED WITH 'CROOKED' COMPANY

""The disturbing thing that the Democrats found was that the two places that [Maguire] went for advice... were the White House counsel and the Department of Justice, the office of legal counsel — when Donald Trump, head of the White House, and Mr. [Bill] Barr, the attorney general, are implicated in this story,"" Toobin continued. ""So the question was, did he get really good and fair advice?""

Democrats moved forward with an impeachment investigation after Trump spoke with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky about initiating a probe into Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Hunter was found to have ties to Barisma, a natural gas firm, that paid him $50,000 a month while it was under investigation in a corruption probe. Trump said he wanted answers.

Lawmakers claim Trump abused his authority and attempted to withhold military funding from Ukraine. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the White House of instigating a cover-up after Thursday's hearing and said the administration willfully tried to hide information.

“This is a cover-up,” Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. “Here we are with another example of the disregard for the Constitution by the president."""

""My view is that, given the latest revelation, which is such a blatant effort to use his presidential position to advance his personal and political interests, there should be an impeachment inquiry opened,"" Clinton told CBS News. ""And I think, sadly, there are a number of grounds. But this one is incredibly troubling.""

She was referring to the dust-up over a July call between Trump and his counterpart in Ukraine, in which he asked for an inquiry into onetime Vice President Joe Biden, Biden's son Hunter, and their dealings there.

""I believe that -- look there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again. And I’m hoping that both the public and press understand the way Trump plays the game,” she told CBS.

Clinton appeared to empathize with Biden, saying ""the most outrageously false things"" were said about her during the 2016 election and suggested the same thing is happening to the former vice president, seen as a potential 2020 Trump rival for the White House.

“Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty,” he tweeted.

SCHIFF SLAMMED FOR CHALKING UP 'DISTURBING' FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TO 'PARODY'

He continued, “Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

The dramatic reading happened Thursday when Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the whistleblower complaint about the call that touched off a formal impeachment inquiry this week.

The complaint and the transcript of that call, both released this week, detailed how Trump urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call, according to the transcript. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

But at the hearing, Schiff, D-Calif., offered an exaggerated version of the call.

“I have a favor I want from you,” Schiff said while appearing to read from a piece of paper. “And I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.”

Schiff later chalked up his fictional summary of the phone call to a joke as he came under fire from conservatives for making up quotes.

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody,"" Schiff said. ""The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, ‘If you don’t understand me I’m going to say it seven more times,’ my point is, that’s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.""

Trump on Friday was not buying that claim, however.

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,” he tweeted.

Schiff quickly responded to Trump’s tweet with one of his own, accusing him of trying to cover up a “shakedown.”

“But you’re right about one thing — your words need no mockery,"" Schiff said. ""Your own words and deeds mock themselves."""

""He sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader, to take action to help the president's 2020 reelection bid. There it is, that line. He did what he's been accused of doing.

""It's a moment, and Democrats, if they've got brains, and any political savvy– will grab this moment. No more hearings, no more subpoenas, no more contempt citations... they've got him.""

The rough transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released a day earlier by the White House. It confirmed that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though it did not show the president explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested in some media reports.

But the whistleblower complaint, released by the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee ahead of testimony from Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, goes further, though it is not a first-hand account of the call.

The whistleblower, who remains anonymous, says in the complaint that White House officials who heard the call were ""deeply disturbed"" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.""

""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room,"" the complaint says.

To begin with, he recited a parody of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that was so absurd, it would not have made it into a Grade-C mob movie. A telling decision by Schiff, a capable former prosecutor: If you have an extortionate conversation, you quote it. If you need to imagine it into something it isn’t, that means it is not an extortionate conversation.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: TRIANGULATING MANAFORT -- OBAMA, CLINTON AND UKRAINE

Also telling: Chairman Schiff came flying out of the starting block describing how overwhelmingly dependent Ukraine is on the United States and its president. Of course, this fact must be forced to the fore because it is not obvious from the Trump-Zelensky conversation — again, Schiff does not have evidence that Trump extorted Zelensky for the purpose of aiding Trump’s 2020 campaign.

But more to the point, the relationship of dependency intensified in 2015 due to the flight to Moscow of Ukraine’s president, Viktor Yanukovych. At that point, a new Ukrainian government more to the Obama administration’s liking, under President Petro Poroshenko, came to power.

The new government was desperate for American help, financially and security-wise, which is why Vice President Joe Biden was in a position to pressure it into firing the prosecutor who was conducting a corruption investigation of Burisma, the energy company that had appointed Hunter Biden to its board and was lavishly compensating him.

In “Ball of Collusion,” I outline some of the extensive evidence that in 2016, the Obama administration’s law enforcement agencies pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to revive a dormant corruption investigation of Paul Manafort.

The chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees initially requested a laundry list of documents on Sept. 9 and sent a follow-up letter on Monday.

""Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry,"" wrote Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.; Foreign Affairs chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.; and Oversight chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md.

The chairmen asked for State Department correspondence and documents dating from Jan. 20, 2017, to the present. The documents relate to reports that Trump pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the Bidens' business activity in Ukraine.

The Democratic lawmakers also demanded any copies of the transcript of Trump's July 25 controversial call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and a list of State Department officials who might have been involved with the conversation, according to the letter. The chairmen are additionally requesting any State Department records about Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and any records that relate to U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

They said Pompeo has until Oct. 4, to comply with the requests.

In a separate letter, the chairmen notified Pompeo that they had scheduled depositions for five State Department officials between Oct. 2 and Oct. 10. Those officials are former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

All of the officials except Kent are named in a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

""The failure of any of these department employees to appear for their scheduled depositions shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry,"" the chairmen said.

Trump has called the impeachment probe, which centers on his policy toward Ukraine, ""another witch hunt,"" and has repeatedly said his call with Zelensky was ""perfect."" He has also adamantly denied withholding military aid from the Eastern European country as a condition of a probe of the Bidens.

He pushed back against media reports questioning his call with Ukraine again on Friday, tweeting, ""If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can ever again speak to another foreign leader!""

Zelensky said this week that ""nobody pushed me"" during his July call with Trump.

A memorandum of the call was made public Wednesday. It shows that while Trump sought an investigation into the Biden family for corruption, the president did not explicitly leverage military aid as had been suggested.

During a “regularly scheduled” and “routine” phone call on Aug. 14, CIA General Counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood notified John Demers, the top official in the Justice Department’s National Security Division, of the issue, a source familiar with the sequence of events told Fox News.

TRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT

According to the source, Demers contacted Elwood the next day for more information and then went to the White House to read the transcribed notes from Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Demers then shared the information with other top Justice Department officials and discussed next steps.

According to the source, Attorney General Bill Barr was not involved in the conversations or informed on the matter at that point. It is unclear when Barr was briefed on the matter, but at least one senior Justice Department official was made aware of the call and concerns surrounding it that day.



Fox News has learned that during the weekly call between Demers and Elwood on Aug.14th, there were also other officials on the call, including at least one White House official. At the end of the call Elwood brought up a potential issue she had heard about a White House phone call. The White House official on the call mentioned that there was a transcript of the call and that is how Demers ultimately ended up at the White House the next day to review the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call.



The following week, beginning on Aug.19th, there was confusion among Demers and other officials at the Department of Justice because the CIA had made them aware of the phone call and a potential complaint, but the CIA had not made an actual referral to the DOJ, leaving the Department without a clear path, according to a person familiar with the sequence of events.



The situation was ultimately resolved on Aug. 26th when the DOJ received the complaint from the Director of National Intelligence and the intelligence community inspector general.

The official whistleblower complaint regarding that call had already been transmitted to the intelligence community inspector general at that point. The IG has reported receiving that information on Aug. 12.

But the DOJ apparently learned of the concerns days before the complaint was formally turned over by the IG. The inspector general relayed the complaint to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26, who then referred the matter to the Justice Department for review of executive privilege in the contents of the phone call.

Maguire testified on his handling of the matter on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee, defending his actions and citing the “unprecedented” nature of the matter.

The timeline of when the Justice Department first learned of the call was first reported by CNN on Thursday. The names of the officials involved in those initial discussions were not known until now.

The phone call is now at the heart of Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry into the president, announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week.

INTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING

The White House released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on notes and recollections of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a “favor” and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that [Joe] Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokrin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

The whistleblower’s complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, alleged that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, and claimed that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to intervene in the 2020 presidential election. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that this was based on second-hand information.

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, Trump allies note that it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid—which had been frozen days earlier. Biden is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.

On the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Wednesday, Trump met with Zelensky, who was asked by reporters about whether he felt pressured by Trump on the phone call this summer.

“I think you read everything. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the U.S.A.,” Zelensky said. “We had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.”

He added: “Nobody pushed me.”"

Republicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower's sources in the White House didn't file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower procedures did not protect second-hand complaints until shortly before the whistleblower filed the complaint against Trump. (The New York Times reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed The Times' report.)

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News' ""Shepard Smith Reporting"" on Thursday that the administration had an apparent ""leak problem,"" adding, ""if they're leaking something that's supposed to be classified, then ... that probably is criminal in nature.""

""Let's find out,"" Biggs said when Smith asked if he wanted to see the whistleblower's sources.

The whistleblower's complaint, released earlier in the day, contained no firsthand accounts of wrongdoing. It cited information from White House officials who alleged there'd been efforts to hide Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository after leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.

FLASHBACK: LEAK OF TRUMP CALL WITH AUSTRALIA LEADER PROMPTS WH TO INCREASE SECURITY MEASURES

The complaint stated that Trump made a “specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike"" -- a request that does not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration on Tuesday. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server.

And according to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to ""contain the damage"" from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's outreach to Ukraine.

But a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News on Thursday, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine -- even sending Giuliani a message reading, ""connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.""

Additionally, the complaint said Trump ""suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep"" his current prosecutor general, a claim not supported by the transcript.

CBS News reported late Thursday that the whistleblower complaint further inaccurately claimed that a State Department official was on the call with Zelensky.

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ACCUSES BIDENS OF CORRUPTION, DEMS OF HYPOCRISY

The memo was not a ""verbatim transcript"" but was based on ""notes and recollections"" of those memorializing the call.

As questions arose concerning the whistleblower's identity and credibility, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., echoed Biggs' skepticism and called for more information.

""It is imperative we find out which White House official talked to the whistleblower and why. Why didn’t they lodge the complaint?"" he asked on Twitter.

""When I think of whistleblower complaints I generally think of someone with first-hand knowledge of the events in question,"" Graham added.

Trump, for his part, reportedly threw his support behind an inquiry into the whistleblower's sources.

""I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,"" Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by The Los Angeles Times. ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.""

TRUMP ADMIN DECLASSIFIES, RELEASES WHISTLEBLOWER TRANSCRIPT

Among the whistleblower's most explosive accusations was that ""White House officials who heard"" Trump's July call with Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed"" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.""

The complaint cited ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.""

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES

The complaint went on to raise the specter of a cover-up. It said, ""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room.""

Trump administration officials allegedly said White House attorneys ""directed"" them to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they normally were kept, according to the complaint. Instead, the transcript allegedly was kept on a system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower said that, according to White House officials, it was ""not the first time"" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, defended his handling of the whistleblower complaint, while calling the matter ""unprecedented.""

But after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter needed to be investigated.

READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT

READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL

Maguire stressed that the committee had all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint, released publicly Thursday morning, and said it's up to its members to decide how to proceed.

Maguire also stressed that the complaint essentially was ""hearsay,"" not ""corroborated by other folks.""

On Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. Zelensky, speaking with Trump later in the day, said he did not feel pressured at all during the call to investigate Biden.

Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Biden's son Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board.

Biden supporters say Shokin was widely accused of corruption. On the flipside, critics charged that Hunter Biden essentially might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.

Trump made the request on the call for Ukraine to look into the Bidens after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving CrowdStrike.

The call came not long after Trump had frozen millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. However, the aid was later released to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians were unaware the money was frozen in the first place until more than a month after Trump's call with Zelensky, according to The New York Times.

‘DESERVE’S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT’

Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into President Trump’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between.



We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs.



This note, for example, would be a poor source for Major League Baseball forecasting since it is our position that the St. Louis Cardinals not only will win it all but deserve to win it all.



As William Munny told Little Bill Daggett right before he blew his head off with a Spencer repeating rifle on a saloon floor: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”



There are plenty of people who think that Bill Clinton unfairly beat the rap, and even some who still think Richard Nixon got a raw deal. If you flipped through the back pages of enough bibliographies, you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.



Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke in his second term, with his wife acting as a kind of regent for his last 17 months in office but Congress took no action. Warren Harding’s administration – in particular his Interior and Justice departments – was a quagmire of corruption, but he was dead and buried before any of it came to light. Lyndon Johnson grievously abused the powers of office for political advantage but he never faced any repercussions.



The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence.

Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen.



Studies suggest that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.



We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening.



But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here.



And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.



For the sake of everybody who is going to be out there fighting passionately for their side, whatever it is, we’ll do our best to not pick one.

TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME…

NatGeo: “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. Children’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausmärchen), later titled Grimm’s Fairy Tales, are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands, Jacob and Wilhelm were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation. Storytelling expressed the essence of German culture and recalled the spirit and basic values of its people. By excavating Germany’s oral traditions, the brothers urgently sought to ‘preserve them from vanishing . . . to be forever silent in the tumult of our times.’”

WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, ‘no.’ When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: ‘I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.’”



More family woes for Biden - Politico: “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau. Biden’s brother, James, made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.”



Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “As a Democratic candidate for president, [Bernie] Sanders frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.”



Biden leads the pack in Maryland - Goucher College: “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for Kamala Harris, and 5 percent for Pete Buttigieg. All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. …Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’”



ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER

NYT: “Darrell Issa, the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative Duncan Hunter, who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.”

*AHEM* THEY GOT TRASHED

News24: “A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception. Officials trucked in litter and waste that had already been collected from rubbish-strewn coasts, and scattered it all over the pristine sand of southwest Jindo. The following day hundreds of volunteers scoured the shores and bagged up the garbage as part of an event to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day, a global event aimed at countering the scourge of sea-borne waste. ‘We brought in waste styrofoam and other coastal trash gathered from nearby areas so the 600 participants could carry out clean-up activities,’ said Lee Dong-jin, Jindo county mayor, in a statement. His office apologised for causing trouble and said the event was meant to ‘raise awareness about the seriousness of coastal waste.’”

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS

Trump’s request that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky “do us a favor” in looking into alleged corruption of a political opponent – former Vice President Joe Biden – is clear cut in the summary notes of the July 25 call between the two presidents that was released Wednesday by the White House.

And we are now learning that Trump reportedly made a discussion of Biden a precondition of the phone call with Zelensky – an obvious abuse of power.

ABC News reported Wednesday that “Ukrainian officials came to recognize a precondition to any executive correspondence” between Zelensky and Trump was a commitment to discuss the involvement of Biden (Trump’s potential 2020 election opponent) and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine.

TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT

ABC reported: ‘""It was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,""’ said Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine's Parliament, who now acts as an adviser to Zelensky. ‘This issue was raised many times. I know that Ukrainian officials understood.""’

As a legal standard, we don’t even need a quid pro quo to impeach, though it is present in the notes of the call. Against the backdrop of nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine that was frozen by Trump before the call – and that Ukraine urgently needed to defend itself against Russian aggression – the two presidents had this exchange, according to the White House’s rough summary:

Zelensky’s quid: “Thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.” (Javelins are anti-tank missiles).

Trump’s Quo: “I would like you to do us a favor though….”

There’s more, of course. Trump’s mention of reciprocity; his request that Ukraine investigate Biden; and his mention that his people (Attorney General William Barr and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) will be in touch with Ukraine all read like a classic mob shakedown.

As journalist Ryan Lizza put it: “Anyone who has ever listened to the Gotti tapes will recognize the subtlety here.” I’ve heard the tapes of the late Mafia boss and Lizza is spot on.

And by the way, why was Trump using his personal attorney rather than U.S. government officials to deal with a foreign country? This was not only highly inappropriate, but ironic, given that Giuliani made his reputation as a crusading U.S. attorney in New York City by prosecuting Mafia figures.

What’s more, we know what lengths the Trump administration at first went to avoid allowing the whistleblower complaint against Trump regarding his call with Zelensky becoming public. The Washington Post reports that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire threated to resign over concerns that the White House may force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday morning.

Maguire has denied the resignation threat publicly, but released a letter emphasizing his commitment to protecting whistleblowers and has pushed the White House to make explicit whether it would assert executive privilege. He is no doubt caught in a fight between Congress and the White House.

Buckling to pressure from Democrats, the Trump administration turned over the whistleblower complaint about the Trump-Zelensky phone call to select members of congressional intelligence committees Wednesday afternoon, along with related documents. And Wednesday night Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said on “The Ingraham Angle” on Fox News Channel that the whistleblower complaint has been declassified, though it was not immediately publicly available.

In announcing the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was clear that the Trump-Zelensky call isn’t the only instance by Trump of impeachable conduct, but is the most easily digestible. She’s absolutely right.

I have been against the idea of a formal impeachment inquiry since we saw the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. That isn’t because I don’t believe that President Trump obstructed justice. I think it’s quite obvious that he did, and I wish that Justice Department guidelines allowed for Mueller to make a decision one way or the other on charging Trump with obstruction.

The Mueller report was enough for dozens of Democrats to get on board with impeachment, but not Pelosi and certainly not a majority of moderate House Democrats who either found the argument for impeachment not compelling or felt the politics were too dangerous for Democrats.

Things are different today and there is little ambiguity. Impeachment remained unpopular before now, with the latest Quinnipiac poll showing that only 37 percent of Americans supported impeachment, with 57 percent against. And while 73 percent of Democrats were supportive, we know that the country is made up of more than just Democrats and that the politics of impeachment remain perilous.

But it remains to be seen what impact the rapidly unfolding revelations on Trump’s efforts to use Ukraine to hurt Biden’s candidacy will have on public sentiments about the need for impeachment. We’ll get a better reading on this when new polls come out in the next few weeks.

It’s important to remember that these are perilous times and things change, as they did during impeachment hearings for President Richard Nixon in 1974, when public support for impeachment grew dramatically.

Today we have a president who is abusing the power of his office for his personal and political gain, putting his own interests ahead of America’s. He clearly should not be entrusted with the highest office in the land. The mental gymnastics to avoid coming to that conclusion are too much to ask, even of the biggest partisans.

I know that the prospect of a Democratic president feels like an intolerable nightmare to millions of Americans, but the prospect of supporting a man with so little regard for the office of the presidency and the American people is an intolerable nightmare we are all living through today.

Chris Stewart announced on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" and on social media late Wednesday that the explosive whistleblower complaint concerning President Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader has been declassified -- and Stewart said that it doesn't contain any damning information.

""I encourage you all to read it,"" Stewart tweeted. The complaint was not immediately available to the public, but was expected to be released Thursday morning.

""It's been declassified and it's been released,"" Stewart separately told anchor Laura Ingraham. ""So it should be available for everyone to go and look at.""

Stewart added that he has personally viewed the complaint, and was initially ""anxious"" before he took a look -- but now is ""much more confident than I was this morning that this is going to go nowhere. ... there are just no surprises there.""

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES

He continued, ""The entirety of it is focused on this one thing, and that's the transcript of one phone call, the transcript that was released this morning.""

The major development came hours before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was set to testify before Congress on Thursday. Fox News is told there was serious conversation among lawmakers as to how far Maguire could go in an open session at the hearing. One source tells Fox News the administration may have declassified the document so it could be discussed publicly during the hearing.

On Wednesday, Maguire flatly contradicted a report in The Washington Post, and asserted that he never considered resigning over the whistleblower matter or for any other reason.

A bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate, who have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint, were granted access to the document in a secure and classified setting earlier Wednesday ahead of Maguire's testimony.

Earlier in the day, the White House released a declassified transcript of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired.

Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while critics charged that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.

Trump made the request on the call for Ukraine to look into the Bidens after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike.

Multiple news outlets -- including The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, and The Washington Post -- inaccurately reported that the ""favor"" related specifically to investigating Biden.

READ THE FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRUMP PHONE CALL

""I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly,"" Zelensky said in the transcript. That prompted Trump to remark, ""Good, because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good. ... he was shut down and that's really unfair. ... The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

The transcript did not demonstrate that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in The Washington Post had claimed.

Meanwhile, lawyers for the whistleblower – a member of the intelligence community – confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that the whistleblower wanted to testify before Congress and was waiting on possible guidance from Maguire.

The lawyers also confirmed to Fox News they had worked with a nonprofit to establish a GoFundMe page seeking to raise an initial $100,000 for the whistleblower's legal defense.

The whirlwind turn of events came as President Trump has continued his efforts to turn the tables on Democrats.

WHISTLEBLOWER SETS UP GOFUNDME, WANTS $100G

At a press conference in New York on Wednesday, Trump specifically called attention to a little-discussed CNN report from May, which described how Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy pushed Ukraine’s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and, by Democrats' current logic, seemingly implied that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake.

""The Democrats have done what they're accusing me of doing,"" Trump said.

The Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Ukraine's leader at the time: ""In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building [democratic] institutions despite ongoing military, economic, and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump.""

The senators called for the top prosecutor to “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

The Post's Marc Thiessen initially flagged the letter on Tuesday, calling it evidence of a ""double standard"" among Democrats.

""Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the president of Ukraine that if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress,"" Trump added.

That was a reference to the Connecticut Democrat's comments at a bipartisan meeting in Kiev earlier this month when Murphy called U.S. aid the “most important asset” of Ukraine -- then issued a warning.

""I told Zelensky that he should not insert himself or his government into American politics,"" Murphy said, according to The Hill. ""I cautioned him that complying with the demands of the President's campaign representatives to investigate a political rival of the President would gravely damage the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. There are few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in Washington these days, and support for Ukraine is one of them.""

Responding to Trump's statements, Murphy said that ""in the meeting Republican Senator Ron Johnson and I had with President Zelensky three weeks ago, I made it clear to him that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election and that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign. I still believe this to be true.""

Trump's comments came shortly after he wrapped up a joint media appearance with Zelensky -- who flatly told reporters that he did not feel ""pushed"" to investigate Joe Biden.

“We had a great phone call,” Zelensky said earlier, as he sat across from Trump. “It was normal.”

In colorful language, Trump told reporters that the evidence clearly showed Democrats were disingenuously attacking him for political gain.

""We have the greatest economy we've ever had,"" the president said. ""When you see little [House Intelligence Committee Chair] Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic, smart guy by the way. ... Then he goes into a room with [House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry] Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off.""

Not all Democrats in the House have been on board with the impeachment inquiry announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Wednesday that the Ukraine transcript did not present a ""compelling"" reason to impeach the president.

Taking the fight to the Democrats over the scores of Democrats who do support an impeachment inquiry could pay dividends for Republicans ahead of next year's elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Wednesday that its fundraising was up 608 percent after Democrats' impeachment push.

""They must laugh their asses off."" — President Trump, referring to Democrats Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff

And the Trump reelection campaign and GOP announced they had raised a combined $5 million in just 24 hours.

Trump on Wednesday also called for transparency ""from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.""

After Trump spoke, political scientist Ian Bremmer said the real scandal wasn't Biden's pressure to get rid of Ukraine's prosecutor, but Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine.

Hunter Biden took a key position at Burisma shortly after Joe Biden visited Ukraine in 2014 and pushed officials there to greatly increase natural gas production. Hunter made tens of thousands of dollars a month but had no relevant credentials.

""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" Bremmer wrote.

""That’s a problem for the Vice President, but completely unrelated to Biden urging Ukraine President to fire his Special Prosecutor,"" Bremmer continued. ""[The prosecutor] was corrupt, refused to investigate anyone, and who Dems and GOP agreed needed to go.""

Also during the day, the Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News –pushed back on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress.

The letter also said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call.

Sources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation.

But by any fair analysis, the transcript released yesterday of President Trump’s call with the Ukraine leader did not help his cause.

This is not a partisan observation, as I’ve repeatedly said and written that the media coverage of Trump is relentlessly negative and often unfair. And as I noted yesterday, the press has so badly overhyped so many Trump controversies, large and small, that there is a collective numbness to the latest cries of scandal.

MEDIA’S UKRAINE REPORTING PRESSURES PELOSI INTO FINALLY BACKING IMPEACHMENT

But now that we have the transcript of the July call, it’s clear that the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post reports were largely accurate. It was not, as the president said yesterday, a “nothing call.”

That doesn’t mean it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. It doesn’t mean there aren’t legitimate questions about Joe Biden’s intervention in Ukraine while his son was making big bucks from a gas giant.

But if you flipped the script—if Barack Obama had asked Ukraine in 2011 to help investigate one of Mitt Romney’s sons—Republicans would have gone nuclear.

One thing we learned from the transcript is that Trump brought up a company with Ukrainian ties that is said to have been involved in the hacking of Democratic emails during the last campaign.

This came right after Volodymyr Zelensky was talking about military aid, saying “we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.”

“I would like you to do us a favor, though…I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”

Crowdstrike is the company supposedly tied to the 2016 hacking.

Zelensky is friendly throughout, promising cooperation, and was the first to bring up Rudy Giuliani.

Then Trump played the Biden card and referenced the former vice president pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had what was apparently an inactive case against the Ukrainian gas giant that was paying Hunter Biden big bucks.

“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair…Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great…

“There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.”

So in just one week, we have confirmation that Trump did ask Zelensky to investigate his political rival, which would obviously help the president’s reelection prospects.

But was there pressure? A quid pro quo? Trump did not specifically bring up military aid, but then, he didn’t have to. Zelensky was acutely aware that the White House—the president did it personally—had held up $391 million in appropriated payments to his country.

“All they’re talking about is nonsense,” Trump said at the U.N. yesterday, adding: “It’s all fake stuff the media makes up with the Democrats, their partners, they’re one and the same, they’re partners.”

And Zelensky, at a televised meeting, said he never felt pressured by Trump.

As the pundits parse the call, this is ultimately not a legal question. High crimes and misdemeanors is whatever a majority of the House says it is.

Pelosi may come to regret unleashing these forces, since polls show that impeachment remains unpopular with a majority of the country."

Furthermore, he said that the computer system cannot be used for “political reasons” or to protect anyone, only for the ""most sensitive secrets”

“That system is not to be used in that way. It’s not designed to protect the president from any dealings or extorting behavior or acts he takes.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

The House of Representatives moved forward on an impeachment inquiry this week, though they have not held a formal vote on the matter. Democrats accuse President Trump of abusing his office by requesting that Ukraine investigate his potential 2020 election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Trump's July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered a whistleblower complaint that touched off a political tempest in Washington, D.C. The complaint was released publicly on Thursday, alleging Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

Earlier on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that Attorney General William Barr has ""gone rogue,"" alleging there was an attempted ""cover-up"" of the whistleblower complaint.

""He’s gone rogue,"" Pelosi said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" after host Joe Scarborough asked if she was concerned that the country's institutions could fail due to Barr's behavior.

""I think where they are going is the cover-up of the cover-up, and that's very really sad for them. To have a Justice Department go so rogue, they have been for a while, and now it just makes matters worse,"" said Pelosi, faulting Barr for instructing the director of national intelligence to bring the whistleblower complaint to the White House."

Republicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower's sources in the White House didn't file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower procedures did not protect second-hand complaints until shortly before the whistleblower filed the complaint against Trump. (The New York Times reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed The Times' report.)

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News' ""Shepard Smith Reporting"" on Thursday that the administration had an apparent ""leak problem,"" adding, ""if they're leaking something that's supposed to be classified, then ... that probably is criminal in nature.""

""Let's find out,"" Biggs said when Smith asked if he wanted to see the whistleblower's sources.

The whistleblower's complaint, released earlier in the day, contained no firsthand accounts of wrongdoing. It cited information from White House officials who alleged there'd been efforts to hide Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository after leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.

FLASHBACK: LEAK OF TRUMP CALL WITH AUSTRALIA LEADER PROMPTS WH TO INCREASE SECURITY MEASURES

The complaint stated that Trump made a “specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike"" -- a request that does not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration on Tuesday. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server.

And according to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to ""contain the damage"" from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's outreach to Ukraine.

But a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News on Thursday, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine -- even sending Giuliani a message reading, ""connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.""

Additionally, the complaint said Trump ""suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep"" his current prosecutor general, a claim not supported by the transcript.

CBS News reported late Thursday that the whistleblower complaint further inaccurately claimed that a State Department official was on the call with Zelensky.

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ACCUSES BIDENS OF CORRUPTION, DEMS OF HYPOCRISY

The memo was not a ""verbatim transcript"" but was based on ""notes and recollections"" of those memorializing the call.

As questions arose concerning the whistleblower's identity and credibility, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., echoed Biggs' skepticism and called for more information.

""It is imperative we find out which White House official talked to the whistleblower and why. Why didn’t they lodge the complaint?"" he asked on Twitter.

""When I think of whistleblower complaints I generally think of someone with first-hand knowledge of the events in question,"" Graham added.

Trump, for his part, reportedly threw his support behind an inquiry into the whistleblower's sources.

""I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,"" Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by The Los Angeles Times. ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.""

TRUMP ADMIN DECLASSIFIES, RELEASES WHISTLEBLOWER TRANSCRIPT

Among the whistleblower's most explosive accusations was that ""White House officials who heard"" Trump's July call with Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed"" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.""

The complaint cited ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.""

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES

The complaint went on to raise the specter of a cover-up. It said, ""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room.""

Trump administration officials allegedly said White House attorneys ""directed"" them to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they normally were kept, according to the complaint. Instead, the transcript allegedly was kept on a system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower said that, according to White House officials, it was ""not the first time"" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, defended his handling of the whistleblower complaint, while calling the matter ""unprecedented.""

But after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter needed to be investigated.

Maguire stressed that the committee had all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint, released publicly Thursday morning, and said it's up to its members to decide how to proceed.

Maguire also stressed that the complaint essentially was ""hearsay,"" not ""corroborated by other folks.""

On Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. Zelensky, speaking with Trump later in the day, said he did not feel pressured at all during the call to investigate Biden.

The call came not long after Trump had frozen millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. However, the aid was later released to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians were unaware the money was frozen in the first place until more than a month after Trump's call with Zelensky, according to The New York Times.

She described it as ""nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings—all of which shows nothing improper,"" adding Trump ""has nothing to hide.""

The complaint cites “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call"" and accuses Trump of attempting “to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.” Going beyond the details revealed in the transcript, the complaint then presents allegations that the White House tried to ""restrict access"" to records of the call.

""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced--as is customary--by the White House Situation Room,"" the complaint says.

The complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were ""directed"" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower says that, according to White House officials, it was ""not the first time"" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information.

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES

The White House released a record of the call Wednesday, confirming a request from Trump for Ukraine to assist Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in investigating Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. It also shows, as the complaint alleges, that Trump intended for Attorney General Bill Barr to be involved in this investigation as well.

Republicans maintain that the questions about Biden's intervention are legitimate.

Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, though. Still, critics charged that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.

The complaint cites articles from The Hill, in which Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko alleged that Biden pushed for Shokin's termination to put an end to the Burisma investigation, that other Ukrainian officials had ""interfered"" in the 2016 presidential election by working with the Democratic National Committee, and that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev kept Ukrainian prosecutors from going to the U.S with evidence related to the election. The complaint notes that Lutsenko had expressed a desire to discuss these allegations with Barr.

Trump made the request on the July call for Ukraine to look into the Bidens after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike.

WHISTLEBLOWER LAWYERS WORK WITH NONPROFIT TO LAUNCH GOFUNDME PAGE SEEKING $100G AHEAD OF POSSIBLE TESTIMONY

The complaint goes on to say that the day after the call, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker went to Kiev and met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian figures. The whistleblower says that ""[b]ased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials,"" Volker and U.S. European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland gave Zelensky advice ""about how to 'navigate' the demands that the President had made of [Zelensky].""

The complaint drew criticism from Republicans after it was reported that that whistleblower did not have first-hand knowledge of the call. The Intelligence Community Inspector General’s office also found that the whistleblower showed “some indicia of an arguable political bias” favoring “a rival political candidate.” The IG’s office did, however, determine that the allegation in the complaint “appears credible.”

Another incident described in the complaint is an Aug. 2 meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and a Zelensky adviser, which U.S. officials said was a ""direct follow-up"" to Trump's phone call.

The Justice Department has since examined the call and determined that Trump's requests from Ukraine did not rise to the level of an in-kind contribution to his presidential campaign that warranted further investigation.

Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif, said on Fox Business Network Thursday that the trip mostly concerns the European Reassurance Initiative, which invests billions supporting European allies -- mostly in Eastern Europe -- in response to the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Garamendi is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on readiness.

INTEL CHIEF MAGUIRE DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, CALLS ISSUE ‘UNPRECEDENTED’

“In the intervening time we have the president pulling $770 million out of that program, and these are critical infrastructure so that our troops can actually engage if ever necessary in Eastern Europe, and of course we were going to do the Ukraine thing looking at the military support that we're giving,” he said on ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast.""

He said that trip was planned four months ago, but noted that it has now become “all tied up in this impeachment issue.”

He was referring to the controversy surrounding the newly revealed phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. The transcript of the call was released this week after a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

The allegation has escalated Democratic calls for Trump’s impeachment, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announcing a formal inquiry this week. Democrats allege that the call indicates a quid pro quo, with Trump holding military spending in return for an investigation into a political opponent. The transcript, though, does not show Trump explicitly linking the two. The money was eventually delivered.

READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT

On CNN Friday morning, Garamendi said the delegation is hoping to meet with political leaders in Kiev, including the defense minister, but said that “given all of the disruption it remains to be seen exactly how that goes.”

“The question there is Ukraine is a critical ally. Ukraine has been invaded by Russia. What does all of this mean to Ukraine, how can we make sure that they get the assistance that they need to continue to push back against Russia and ultimately be successful and push Russia out of Ukraine?” he said.

However, Garamendi also said that he believed a quid pro quo was relayed, and didn’t rule out speaking to officials about the Biden matter. He has previously said he intends to “hold discussions on this matter and inquire about the conversations [Trump attorney] Rudy Giuliani and President Trump have had with Ukrainian leadership."" However, he said the delegation has to be ""very very careful"" about the subject on the trip to the country.

“Once again things are rapidly evolving here [and] what the Ukrainian government will do and how it will respond to what has got to be a major political issue for them back in Kiev remains to be seen,” he said on CNN. “And so we're going to be treading very carefully on the political side of this.”"

Wenstrup, a member of the committee, spoke on ""Outnumbered Overtime"" after the hearing with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who was called to testify about his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint alleging Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family.

Schiff was called out during the hearing for at one point reading a fictionalized version of the phone call, later defending the statements as ""parody"" intended for dramatic effect.

""He made this up to fit his narrative. We have the transcript. ... He puts it out there and most of the media will run with that, they'll run with his narrative,"" said Wenstrup, arguing Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky both ran on cleaning up corruption in their respective countries and were discussing that during the call.

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS

The hearing began shortly after the public release of a whistleblower complaint involving Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The complaint alleged that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

Maguire's reputation was also on trial Thursday. He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.

Maguire insisted he is ""not partisan"" and ""not political,"" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times.

Wenstrup said Democrats tried to ""demean"" Maguire in the hearing and ""tear down"" a person of integrity. He said he believes the whistleblower will soon be called to testify behind closed doors so Democrats can say ""whatever they want"" about his testimony.

INTEL CHIEF MAGUIRE DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, CALLS ISSUE ‘UNPRECEDENTED’

The complaint contains allegations related to Trump’s call with Zelensky in July, when he urged him to investigate alleged corruption involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

The White House on Wednesday released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.

However, Schiff’s improvised version of the call was exaggerated, apparently for dramatic effect.

READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT

“I have a favor I want from you,” Schiff said while appearing to read from a paper. “And I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.”

Schiff later chalked his fictional summary of the controversial phone call to a joke.

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody. The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, ‘If you don’t understand me I’m going to say it seven more times,’ my point is, that’s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words,” Schiff said.

“In opening statement, Rep. Schiff makes up dialogue to represent what Trump said to Zelensky. A rough transcript of the president's words exists, and is available, but Schiff's version is more dramatic,” Fox News contributor Byron York tweeted.

MEDIA 'MOVE THE GOALPOSTS' AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT

Conservative commentator Matt Walsh wrote that Schiff “knows that a lot of people watching will think that's actually what the transcript said” when it was pure fiction.

“In fact, the WHOLE POINT is that the transcript DOESN'T say what Schiff just said it said,” Walsh said.

Elise Stefanik, R-NY., later mocked the situation when it was her turn to grill Maguire

“I’m not going to improvise for parody purposes like the chairman of this committee did,” Stefanik said when reading the complaint. “I’m going to quote it directly.”

Stefanik also took to Twitter, calling the situation ""disturbing and outrageous.""

The impeachment inquiry House Democrats are undertaking regarding President Trump is a drastic but necessary measure of last resort to deal with a historic crisis that has put our union in peril.

The central question before Congress is whether Trump and future presidents should be considered above the law and free to take any action they deem justified, or whether they must be held accountable for their actions by Congress.

Disgraced President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 to avoid impeachment following the Watergate scandal, famously said to David Frost in a 1977 interview that his actions were justified because “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

KARL ROVE: PELOSI WAS FORCED TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

That was not the standard when Nixon was in office and it surely isn't the standard today!

In the coming House impeachment investigation of President Trump, both Democrats and Republicans have a solemn responsibility to set partisanship aside, uphold the rule of law and hold him accountable.

This critical task requires a level of patriotism that puts country over party and political wins. House members in both parties should judge Trump based on his actions, not on the fact that he is a Republican or whether they agree or disagree with his policies.

Based on evidence from a White House-released rough transcript of a July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, it seems clear that Trump conditioned nearly $400 million in congressionally allocated military aid to Ukraine on that country's willingness to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden’s son, Hunter

Disgraced President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 to avoid impeachment following the Watergate scandal, famously said to David Frost in a 1977 interview that his actions were justified because “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

Because Joe Biden is currently the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination to run against Trump in 2020 – and because Trump frequently attacks him in comments to reporters and on Twitter – there is no question that Trump is going after the former vice president to weaken him as a potential opponent.

Despite numerous allegations of misconduct against Trump going back to his days as a presidential candidate, for far too long an impeachment inquiry against him has seemed far-fetched. Conventional thinking supported a prolonged wait for the 2020 election as the first possible time he could be removed from office.

However, the breaking news of this week demonstrates that Trump must be held accountable for his potential high crimes and misdemeanors.

The inquiry into Trump’s behavior is far from a witch hunt, despite the president giving it that label. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has launched a legitimate and necessary investigation of what appears to be our president’s abuse of power for personal political gain.

With so much at stake for our nation, Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry have to get this right. Here are the five principles they should keep in mind:

Keep it simple

Impeachment, and the investigation leading up to it, is a legislative maneuver prescribed by the Constitution. It's also a court case in which the American people are the jury. Thus, House Democrats must have one clearly synced message about the nature of the inquiry and the underlying crime.

President Trump continues to state that impeachment is dead, but he is wrong. This inquiry isn't about the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or any other act by this president. It is about the Trump-Zelensky phone call and what that call reveals about Trump’s conduct.

Democrats shouldn’t use the impeachment inquiry to rack up points with their base by throwing everything they can think of against the wall, or by simply attempting to make Trump look bad. This is a serious investigation into whether or not the president broke federal laws and should be removed from office.

Don’t engage the weak White Houses political team

Over the timeline of this whistleblower's complaint, we have seen this White House flop around like a fish out of water. Officials have changed their stories so many times that it is unbelievable.

White House officials rejected both Senate and House subpoenas for the whistleblower’s complaint before flip-flopping and making it public Thursday.

And most importantly, Trump and his team seem to be losing support among some Senate Republicans. Not only did they lose a vote for emergency border wall funding because of GOP defections, but Senate Republicans joined a unanimous resolution demanding the release of the whistleblower complaint to House and Senate committees.

With the White House political shop taking on water, Democrats should focus solely on the letter of the law and avoid the political mudslinging that will likely come their way.

If this president is guilty of soliciting foreign assistance to help him win a national election, Democrats shouldn't play political games. They should let the truth come out and allow the American people to hear it without the dense cloud of the same old Washington politics.

Talk to the American people directly

Since this Ukraine scandal came to light, Trump has managed to harshly and personally attack Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Reps Adam Schiff of California, Maxine Waters of California and Al Green of Texas – all among his sharpest critics in Congress.

And the president has been attacking Joe and Hunter Biden and the integrity of the intelligence whistleblower almost nonstop.

Can you see the pattern? Trump's marquee strategy is an unholy trinity: attack the messenger, lie about the message, and distract as much as possible.

Let's not forget to mention Trump's personal lawyer and co-conspirator, Rudy Giuliani, who pillories opponents on cable TV news shows and regularly contradicts himself, changing his story.

This wildfire that the president has started isn't a 429-page Mueller report with an intricate fact pattern. This political and criminal disaster is based on one phone call, in which Trump linked foreign aid to an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden.

Democrats must stay above the fray, resist the president's distractions, and lay out an impartial case to the American people about presidential corruption and wrongdoing.

This case can't only exist in the Washington Beltway. It has to be laid out in town halls, civic centers, PTA meetings and living rooms across America. There is something here, and it will be the job of Democrats to convince the American people to take a step back, exercise patience and open their ears to the facts.

Keep working on behalf of the American people

In 2018 the American people voted for action from Washington on many of the kitchen table issues that keep them up at night: the rising cost of health care and the exploitative price of prescription drugs, blatant voter suppression, and congressional inaction to reduce deadly shootings.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

House Democrats shouldn’t let the impeachment inquiry stop them from doing their jobs. They should pass bills and work with the White House to try to reach agreement on needed legislation.

Don't rush this

With the Iowa caucuses and the 2020 election around the corner, there will be an urge to rush this impeachment inquiry. Democrats should resist that urge, and take their time.

Laying out all the facts will require time and consistency. With the potential of White House stonewalling and name-calling, any attempt to rush this inquiry will give Trump grounds for his baseless and absurd ""presidential harassment"" argument.

The impartial House impeachment investigation of President Nixon turned public opinion around dramatically to favor his impeachment, leading him to resign when he saw he would be removed from office in a Senate impeachment trial.

With the transcript of that call and the related whistleblower complaint now public -- and the acting director of national intelligence giving his account to a House committee Thursday -- the battle between these two branches of government is truly joined. And neither side is giving an inch.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

Trump and his allies are now ramping up their attacks on Democrats, the media, the whistleblower and the various sources who fed information on the president that made its way into the complaint. House Democrats, meanwhile, are moving full speed ahead with the formal impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers plan to move quickly with their investigation -- raising the possibility of articles of impeachment before year's end.

""The presidential oath of office requires the President of the United States to do two things: Faithfully execute his or her office, and protect and defend the Constitution. The whistleblower complaint and call record provide the most graphic evidence yet Trump has done neither,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff tweeted.

All this has played out in a matter of days, with the Ukraine controversy spurring Democratic leadership into impeachment action in a way the Russia controversy did not. The White House, for its part, spent most of the week trying to clear the air. It released a transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy showing Trump urging his Kiev counterpart to ""look into"" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son—a move Democrats claim was Trump seeking assistance from a foreign power in the 2020 presidential election. The now-released whistleblower complaint on the same call included additional allegations, including claims that officials tried to hide records of the call.

But the president and his legal team are fighting back by likening the whistleblower and his or her sources to spies -- and questioning whether this is all the work of partisans.

""Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?"" Trump tweeted Friday.

He also blasted media coverage, including the New York Times' Peter Baker for his latest reporting on the call.

And he demanded the resignation of Schiff, D-Calif., for ""fraudulently"" reading out a hyperbolic account of his phone call with the Ukrainian president during a hearing on Thursday.

Trump began raising questions about the whistleblower on Thursday.

“I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information?” Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by the Los Angeles Times. “Because that’s close to a spy.”

He added: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow suggested Friday the whistleblower had assistance in writing the complaint that rocked Washington.

“Do you think the whistleblower drafted the complaint? I mean realistically?” Sekulow said on “Fox & Friends.” “Look at the phraseology, the endnotes, and the footnotes—this wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm. The American people see it as it is. Nobody has an appetite for this anymore.”

Sekulow blasted the fallout surrounding the controversy as “political theater.”

“There is no there, there,” he said. “There was no violation of law, rule or regulation.”

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

On Thursday, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Despite being pressed for hours by Democrats, Maguire maintained that the whistleblower complaint was “hearsay” and “second-hand” information—a sentiment Sekulow echoed Friday.

Sekulow also responded to allegations the White House moved call records from a computer system where they are normally kept to a system normally used for classified information.

“A cover-up? Think about that for a moment. The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It’s so secret, and such a cover-up, here’s the documents,” Sekulow said. “This is nonsense.”

The transcript itself showed Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Biden's son Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board. Biden supporters say Shokin was widely accused of corruption.

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.

Trump allies, like Sekulow, and others in the White House, have used that distinction to maintain the claim that “there was no quid pro quo.”

Meanwhile, the whistleblower also alleged that Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whom the president mentioned on the call could help Zelensky in any anti-corruption probes, was improperly involved in soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.

Giuliani, though, defended his involvement, telling Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, “I think I should get some kind of an award.”

“What they charged as Russian collusion was really Ukrainian collusion,” Giuliani said on “The Ingraham Angle” Thursday night. “I am doing an effective job of showing what phonies they are and I am uncovering what you will find to be an enormous pay for play scheme.”

Giuliani also told the Atlantic on Thursday that he thinks he deserves praise for his involvement with Ukraine.

“It is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I’m not,” he told the Atlantic. “And I will be the hero! These morons—when this is over, I will be the hero.”

But Democrats are using all of the developments as fodder as they hit the gas pedal in their impeachment proceedings. Pelosi said Friday that she did not have an exact timetable for impeachment, though noted that it could “take time.”

Pelosi also noted that the House committees involved in the process are going to probe the “cover-up” allegations while saying that Trump’s comments about the whistleblower have been “dangerous.”

“For the president to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government,” Pelosi said Friday. “But the president does that almost every day.”

The House and Senate are on recess for the next two weeks, but members plan to use this period to speak to constituents and garner support for the process.

“Congress ought to be talking to their constituents and gaining their perspective on that and why they think this is such an important facet of this ongoing investigation,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said. “I think consideration of the public’s viewpoint is critically important.”

And freshman pro-impeachment Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said members need to “go home and educate them.”

John Tye, a onetime whistleblower who founded the nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, told Fox News he was working with the whistleblower's lawyers at the Compass Rose Legal Group as a matter of principle. Their fundraising page, which can be found at helpthewhistleblower.org, went live Wednesday evening.

“We hope that Americans will stand up to and stand with this whistleblower and show the government and the president are not above the law,” Tye said. “We are very proud to be supporting this whistleblower. It is a very stressful thing to be a whistleblower.”

In new comments to Fox News, the whistleblower's lawyers said they were focused on communicating all relevant information to Congress.

“Our objective is to ensure that full disclosure of the information is obtained by the relevant oversight authorities,” one of the whistleblower's lawyers, Mark Zaid, told Fox News. “In compliance with the law and to maintain the right of the whistleblower to remain anonymous.”

Another member of the whistleblower's legal team, Charles McCullough III – a former intelligence community inspector general himself who was drawn into the Hillary Clinton email investigation – said early communications with lawmakers have been promising.

“The focus is on the process,"" he said. “There is a law, and we are content that the process appears to be working – the focus is on the process.”

“I have been acting as counsel since the very beginning before the disclosure was made to ensure the law was followed by the client, the disclosure was lawfully made,” Andrew Bakaj, also an attorney for the whistleblower, told Fox News. “We have complied with the law through this entire process.”

The whistleblower – a member of the intelligence community – wanted to testify before Congress and was waiting on possible guidance from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, the lawyers said. Maguire is set to testify himself on Thursday.

""It is a very stressful thing to be a whistleblower.” — John Tye, CEO of Whistleblower Aid

A bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate, who have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint, gained access to the document in a classified setting late Wednesday ahead of Maguire's testimony.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the beginning of an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, citing the whistleblower complaint as possible evidence of Trump's “betrayal of his oath of office.”

WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED

Trump quickly pushed back forcefully. At a news conference in New York on Wednesday, the president dismissed the complaint from what he called the “so-called whistleblower,” and sought to turn the tables -- accusing Biden of possible corruption and Democrats of overt hypocrisy.

The White House also released a transcript of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country. The transcript did not suggest that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a “promise” on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in The Washington Post had claimed.

Zelensky, speaking across from Trump in New York on Wednesday, told reporters he did not feel “pushed” at all in his conversations with the president.

And, the Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News – pushed back Wednesday on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress.

The letter said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump's call with Zelensky.

Sources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation.

Kunis was born in Ukraine and lived there when she was a child.

During questioning from lawmakers on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Maguire said both the ""complicated and sensitive"" nature of a whistleblower complaint on the call, and the release of the transcript itself, were ""unprecedented."" He cautioned that the release, which came amid House Democrats' impeachment inquiry against Trump over his alleged attempt to get Ukraine to investigate the Biden family, could have a chilling effect on what international leaders say in communications with American presidents.

“I think the president when he conducts diplomacy and deals with foreign heads of state, he has every right to be able to have that information be held within the White House and the executive branch,"" Maguire said under questioning from Rep.

""I think that other future leaders when they interact with our head of state may be more cautious in what they say and reduce the interaction that they have with the president because of that release.”

TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT

Congressional Democrats had been clamoring for the text of the call between Trump and Zelensky after information about the whistleblower complaint first made its way to Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the chamber would begin a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday as reports surfaced that Trump --soon after putting a hold on $400 million worth of military aid to Ukraine--asked Zelensky to investigate Biden's son for alleged corruption while on the board of a Ukranian gas company.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" she said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.""

The Trump administration denied that there was a quid-pro-quo and released the transcript of the call on Wednesday, which confirms that Trump mentioned Joe Biden's son to Zelensky, but does not show an explicit offer of military aid in exchange for what would likely have been a politically advantageous investigation for Trump.

Democrats said the pressure was implicit while Trump tweeted after the transcript's release that his conversation with the Ukranian president was, ""a perfect call."""

INTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING

On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee posted the whistleblower report alerting officials to allegedly problematic statements President Trump made during a July 25 call with Ukraine's president. On Thursday, the committee interrogated Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, whom Democrats suggested participated in a cover-up by withholding the complaint from Congress.

Shapiro said it was absurd to claim that the Trump administration of a cover-up since a memorandum of Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released Wednesday.

""So just to be clear, the big bombshell from the whistleblower report is that Trump covered up a transcript that he just released to the public yesterday?"" Shapiro tweeted on Thursday.

During ""The Ben Shapiro Show"" on Friday, Shapiro added that Democrats held a ""miasmatic theory of impeachment"" that claimed Trump was generally corrupt and shouldn't have used his power as president to request an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential opponent in the 2020 election.

House Democrats are moving full speed ahead with the impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers could file articles of impeachment before year's end.

The impeachment push comes after the public release of both the whistleblower's complaint and a transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump requested that Ukraine investigate the Biden family.

The whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. Democrats have accused Trump of an implied quid pro quo, using U.S. military aid as leverage. The White House has vigorously denied that the aid was linked to Trump's request for the investigation.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE

Maguire was grilled by Democrats in a tense hearing Thursday, facing repeated questions from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on why he initially withheld a copy of the complaint from lawmakers.

That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified and released to the public in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.

Maguire insisted he is ""not partisan"" and ""not political,"" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times.

Democrats hammered Maguire for bringing the whistleblower complaint to the Justice Department and the White House, since the president was the subject of the complaint and Barr was mentioned by Trump during the controversial phone call.

Maguire said he believed his response was ""prudent.""

""I believe everything in this matter is totally unprecedented,"" he said.

Whistle-blower says Trump aides disturbed by Ukraine call,https://www.foxnews.com/media/plot-twist-whistle-blower-says-trump-aides-disturbed-by-ukraine-call,"The plot thickens, as it always does.

Now we all get to argue about the mystery whistleblower.

The disclosure that the man who set this in motion does not support Donald Trump’s reelection—a shocker, I know—will fuel counterattacks by the president and his allies. That information comes from the New York Times describing the view of intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson. The source wants to remain anonymous, but the chances that the name doesn’t leak seem to me to be nil.

IMPEACHMENT IS RISKY, BUT TRANSCRIPT SUPPORTS MEDIA’S UKRAINE REPORTING

In fact, the Times yesterday reported yesterday that the person who filed the complaint “is a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity.”

Editor Dean Baquet, responding preemptively to possible criticism, justified the disclosure: “The role of the whistleblower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the United States abused power and whether the White House covered it up.”

Trump pounced on the secret source at a private New York breakfast, according to the Los Angeles Times. (He also called reporters “scum.” I feel this episode has strained our close relations.)

“I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information?” Trump asked. “Because that’s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

In fairness, the CIA officer did go through official channels, and the acting intelligence chief spent hours yesterday deflecting a House committee’s questions of why he didn’t move more quickly on the complaint.

I’m inclined not to care that much about the whistleblower, who had no first-hand knowledge of these matters. We already know more than he did because we’ve got the rough transcript.

But there was a key revelation in the complaint, made public yesterday. And it wasn’t that CIA man felt the president was pressuring Ukraine on Joe Biden “for personal gain.” Everyone is familiar with that charge by now.

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

No, it was that several White House officials were “deeply disturbed” by what they heard on the call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the complaint said. Which means more officials are going to be called to testify on the Hill.

What’s more, the unknown complainant claims to have information that “senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down’ all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House Situation Room.”

Needless to say, it’s harder for the president and his team to argue that this was a routine diplomatic call if some people who worked for him treated it as a hair-on-fire moment.

In fact, the scenario here is that the whistleblower wouldn’t even have known about the call had some White House officials not been upset. Instead, the source concluded that Trump “sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president’s 2020 reelection bid.”

Still, Trump tweeted yesterday that this is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” He also called it “a disgrace to our country.”

In a typical probe, the actual words spoken between the president and a foreign leader would be the last revelation of a long, bottom-up investigation, rather than something coughed up within a week of the first newspaper stories. But that means the media and Congress are having to work backwards, to reconstruct what led up to the fateful call.

And the complaint, as well as the rough transcript of the call, makes clear that Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr were key players in the Ukraine drama.

ABC quotes a former Zelensky adviser as saying after the onetime comedian was elected in April, they wanted to speak to Trump. But, said Serhiy Leshchenko, a former member of parliament, “It was clear that Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case.”

This was presumably after the first congratulatory call that Trump placed to Zelensky in April, which he’s said he is willing to release. The New York Times, quoting unnamed sources, said the president urged Zelensky to work with Giuliani in pursuing “corruption.”

So this is becoming quite the detective story. But it still can’t be separated from the politics of impeachment, and most Republicans are backing the president’s stance that the call was no big deal.

Cliff Sims, a former White House aide who in litigation with the president over a somewhat critical book, told Politico: ""Democrats overreaching has been such a political gift to Trump, over and over again. They've been screaming 'treason!' and 'impeachment!' after nearly everything that happens. Middle America is mostly numb to it.”

That is the challenge facing the House Democrats, 220 of whom now support the impeachment probe, beyond the magic number of 218. And sooner or later, the intelligence officer who preferred to remain nameless will be under a very harsh spotlight."

Republicans want to know whistleblower's White House sources, as inconsistencies in complaint emerge

Top Republicans on Thursday pushed to identify the White House officials who told a whistleblower of alleged misconduct by the Trump administration, as Democrats ramped up their impeachment inquiry -- and several apparent inconsistencies emerged in the whistleblower's complaint. Republicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower's sources in the White House didn't file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower procedures do not protect second-hand complaints.

(The New York Times reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed the Times' report.)

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News' ""Shepard Smith Reporting"" on Thursday that the administration had an apparent ""leak problem,"" adding, ""if they're leaking something that's supposed to be classified, then ... that probably is criminal in nature.""

Meanwhile, an unnamed Ukrainian official told the New York Times that Kiev was not made aware that the U.S. suspended security funds until a month after President Trump's call with his counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, which calls into question the whistleblower's account and Democrats' arguments that there was a quid pro quo for the aid.

Whistleblower complaint on Ukraine call declassified and released, alleges Trump solicited foreign 'interference' in election

The whistleblower complaint that touched off a political firestorm in Washington was released to the public Thursday, alleging President Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. The rough transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky was already released a day earlier by the White House. (Click here to read the transcript.) It confirmed that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though it did not show the president explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested in some media reports.

The complaint is not a first-hand account of the call but goes a step further than the transcript. In the complaint, the whistleblower says that White House officials who heard the call were ""deeply disturbed"" by it and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.""

His frustration showed at the end when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated. Maguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information, and it's up to them to decide how to proceed.

Republican governor throws weight behind Trump impeachment inquiry, ex-lawmaker says 35 GOP senators would privately vote to impeach

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott on Thursday became the first Republican governor to back House Democrats' call for an impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Scott said at a news conference that he wasn’t surprised by the allegations that Trump repeatedly urged Ukraine’s president to “look into” Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden because he’s “watched him over the years.” Scott added, however, that he wanted to see more information before taking further action. Other moderate Republican governors have yet to weigh in on an impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake made a bold claim on Thursday at the 2019 Texas Tribune Festival when he said ""at least 35"" GOP senators would privately vote for Trump's impeachment.

The IC encompasses all civilian and military employees and contractors who work for the federal government gathering domestic and foreign intelligence.

The inspector general -- a position appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate -- exists in all parts of the executive branch of the government, except for the White House, to examine and determine if officials are following the law.

A whistleblower refers to a person who works for the government and who believes that her or his colleagues and bosses are engaged in unconstitutional or unlawful or dangerous behavior. A federal statute expressly provides procedures for federal employees to follow in order to make known to an inspector general the potentially unlawful or dangerous behavior.

INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES REVIEWING UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT IN CLOSED SESSION

In the case of the IC, since the subject of a whistleblower complaint can be so serious -- often involving classified materials that affect national security -- the rules provide for an immediate review of the complaint.

The complaint against Trump alleged that he offered a ""promise"" to a foreign head of state that was unlawful or threatening to national security. The IC inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- evaluated the complaint, interviewed the whistleblower, examined documents that the whistleblower provided and concluded that the complaint was ""urgent and credible.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The complaint related that Trump held up the sale of $250 million worth of military equipment and the delivery of $140 million in congressionally mandated foreign aid until the government of Ukraine opened a criminal investigation against the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic contender to oppose Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

Can the president of the United States legally ask a foreign government to provide assistance to his reelection? In a word: No.

Here is the backstory.

After special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his report of the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russian agents to the Department of Justice, and then testified about what he discovered, Trump claimed exoneration. Mueller's report found some evidence of a conspiracy -- 127 telephone calls and numerous meetings -- between Trump's campaign and Russian agents, but not enough to charge the crime of conspiracy to solicit foreign assistance in a domestic political campaign.

Mueller also found 10 instances in which Trump had committed the criminal offense of obstruction of justice by his personal efforts to derail the Mueller investigation. Mueller did not seek an indictment of Trump for behavior that would have gotten any other person in America indicted because Mueller knew that his boss, Attorney General William Barr, who needed to sign off on such an indictment, would not do so.

Trump felt exonerated and emboldened. At the same time that the country was debating publicly what the Mueller report revealed about his behavior, the president instructed the Treasury Department to hold off on the licenses it had provisionally granted to American arms manufacturers to sell a quarter of a billion dollars in arms to Ukraine. He also instructed the State Department to hold off on the delivery of $140 million in direct aid to Ukraine that Congress told him to deliver.

Also at the same time, he began his conversations with his Ukrainian counterpart, during which he urged a criminal investigation of the younger Biden, even though Biden's commercial activities in Ukraine while his father was vice president have produced no credible evidence of criminal behavior.

Yet, as if to flaunt the Mueller findings, Trump apparently personally and directly committed the crime for which he claimed Mueller exonerated him.

What was that crime? It was the attempt to solicit foreign assistance for his campaign. It was the manipulation of American foreign and military policy for a corrupt purpose. A corrupt purpose puts the president personally above the needs of the nation.

In short, the whistleblower alleges that Trump offered a bribe to his Ukrainian counterpart: Go after my likely opponent's son and you will get the $390 million in goods and cash that we are holding up.

If demonstrable, this behavior is far worse than anything alleged or uncovered by Mueller. The acts of obstruction that Mueller found arguably constitute impeachable offenses. That's because the constitutional language of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" as one of the three bases for impeachment has been found by the House of Representatives, in three different generations, to include obstruction. Yet there is still wiggle room as to how much personal presidential obstruction and underlying criminality is needed to constitute an impeachable offense.

There is no such wiggle room for bribery. The Constitution is quite clear that ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" shall constitute a basis for impeachment.

Was Trump offering to bribe the Ukrainian president? The circumstantial evidence is: Yes. The transcript of Trump's critical conversation with the Ukrainian president shows he asked his counterpart to coordinate with American authorities to prosecute the son of his likely political opponent in 2020. That is the solicitation of something of value from a foreign government -- a felony.

Within a week of that conversation, Trump put his hold on the $390 million in aid. That's when the Ukrainian president got the message.

Where does this leave us? We are at the precipice of a constitutional crisis. We have a president whose apparent corruption is palpable. We have a Constitution that prescribes a remedy. We have an attorney general who acts as if he were the president's personal lawyer. We have Republicans in Congress who see and hear no evil from this president. And we have congressional Democrats hesitant to do their constitutional duty.

We have a mess.

Rudy Giuliani, one of the key figures at the center of the latest White House scandal, joined the Fox News Rundown this week to talk about it. And he had a lot to say.

On Thursday's podcast, Giuliani sat down with host Dave Anthony to defend the President against allegations he had inappropriately pressured the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Those allegations made in a whistleblower's complaint released earlier this week led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launching an official impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Something the Democrat leader had put off for months despite pressure from many members of her party.

The President's personal attorney vehemently disputed claims the President's phone call with Zelensky included an offer of a 'quid pro quo' or violated any laws. However, he defended Trump's effort to have the Ukrainians look in to the Biden's family and rejected the arguments made some legal experts that this request alone is a federal crime.

Giuliani has made it his mission for months to expose what he calls the 'dishonesty' and 'corruption' of the Biden family. On the Rundown, He laid out a long detailed case against the former Vice President and his son, accusing them of money laundering and using their political influence to get rich. The former federal prosecutor's list of allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden was so long and complex, we couldn't fit it all in to a single segment.

On the Fox News Rundown Extra this week, you will learn more about Giuliani's role in the events that led to this week's controversy. You will also hear his plans to uncover a conspiracy that includes the Democrats, liberal billionaire George Soros and the 2016 election.

The New York City mayor also explains why he thinks the Democrats' effort to impeach the President will backfire and actually help the Republican party in 2020.

There was a lot to unravel. Here is your chance to hear everything Rudy Giuliani had to say."

Except for the part where Trump talked about former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter. That was inappropriate.

But what’s even more inappropriate is the hysterical, hyperbolic, hypocritical, fabricated (I’m talking to you, Katy Tur) impeachment-seeking reaction to the call.

In football terms, President Trump deserved a five-yard penalty flag. What he did was the equivalent of a false start.

HOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Trump was wrong to request that Zelensky work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to find out what happened when then-Vice President Biden successfully pressured an earlier Ukrainian president to fire a prosecutor who was looking into misconduct by a company called Burisma Holdings. Joe Biden’s son Hunter joined the Ukrainian company’s board in 2014, when his father was serving as vice president.

Presidents and candidates should not call on foreign governments to investigate matters that involve their political opponents. Even if the accusation has merit, presidents and candidates inherently make the issue political when they call on other nations to intervene.

Republicans need to wise up. The overreacting Democrats and their media backers are the real threat to civility, norms and fairness.

Justice should be blind. No one’s fingers should be on the scales of justice, especially when the fingers belongs to the president or other powerful elected officials.

But to Trump’s critics – meaning elected Democrats and much of the media – Trump was headhunting, and they want to throw him out of the game via impeachment. They always have.

This is grossly disproportionate and highly hypocritical.

Trump’s critics don’t want to face the fact that Joe Biden – currently a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the Ukrainian president fired a prosecutor Biden didn’t like.

How many times has the video of Biden’s threat been played on CNN or MSNBC?

The former vice president has a Hunter Biden-sized conflict of interest in this matter and his threat of withholding U.S. loan guarantees makes things worse. But Trump’s critics and much of the media don’t care.

To them, it’s OK when Biden does it. It’s not OK if Trump does.

In addition, three Democratic U.S. senators used their positions of power to pressure Ukrainian officials to do their bidding regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of President Trump.

Sens. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Patrick Leahy of Vermont wrote a letter pressuring Ukrainian officials to work with Mueller to investigate Trump.

So here again we have a double standard. Democrats want us to believe it’s OK when Democratic senators call on Ukrainians to investigate their rival, but it’s not OK if Trump does.

When it comes to working with foreign nations to influence an election, former President Barack Obama’s request to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev takes the cake.

Obama, not wanting his national security positions to become a reelection issue, was caught on camera in 2012 asking Medvedev to tell then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that Obama needed “space” on missile defense negotiations until after U.S. presidential election was over.

In other words, Obama was saying: if you, Vladimir, don’t raise this matter during the election, I’ll have more “flexibility” after the election to reach an accommodation.

Too bad Obama said it on camera. If a whistleblower heard him say it, the case against Obama might have been packaged better.

Even by Washington’s typical standards, the Democratic-media hypocrisy toward Trump is over the top. So too is impeachment.

Many Democrats and their echo chamber in the media have wanted to impeach the Trump even before he took office.

At first, several liberal groups sought to change the outcome of the 2016 election in the Electoral College, but the margin of Trump’s victory was too big for them to succeed. More than 60 elected Democrats boycotted his Inauguration.

As offensive and norm-breaking as Trump can be, it is more norm-breaking and offensive to refuse to accept an election result and instead seek to turn all forms of political disagreement into a constitutional crisis in which the Congress tries repeatedly to remove the president from office, negating the results of an election.

Republicans need to wise up. The overreacting Democrats and their media backers are the real threat to civility, norms and fairness.

Impeachment is not a game. It’s the Constitution’s safety valve and it should only be applied in the gravest of threats to our nation and system of government.

Asking a foreign nation to get involved in an American campaign matter is wrong. It was wrong when Trump did it. It was wrong when Obama did it. It was wrong when Biden did it. It was wrong when Hillary Clinton, through the Steele dossier, did it.

But Republicans of all stripes need to recognize the threat to national unity and cohesion does not come from Trump’s request to Zelensky – it comes from the refusal of Democrats to let the American people decide who our president should be.

Schweizer claimed in an interview airing Sunday on ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" that Donald Trump Jr. would be treated much differently if he was engaged in similar business activity to that of Hunter Biden -- the former Delaware senator's 49-year-old son -- while his father held elected office.

Hunter Biden was paid $50,000 a month by Ukranian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings while it was under investigation for corruption. Media scrutiny of the connection intensified after President Trump was accused of committing an impeachable offense by asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden's dealings.

On ""Life, Liberty & Levin,"" Schweizer said there would be outrage in Congress and the media -- as well as from himself -- if Trump Jr. were involved in a similar situation while his father was in the White House.

PETER SCHWEIZER: HUNTER BIDEN 'WAS SELLING ACCESS' TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, WAS INVOLVED WITH 'CROOKED' COMPANY

""Imagine if Don Junior flew over on Air Force One with his dad and inked a $1.5 billion deal, let's say in an area he has no background in like telecommunications,"" he said. ""Washington would be going ballistic, I would be going ballistic and rightfully so.

""It's a completely different circumstance in the way that response is -- and that's what I think so infuriates people. There are certain people that are supposed to be protected. Biden seems to be one of those.""

During the interview, host Mark Levin alluded to Schweizer's 2018 book ""Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,"" which chronicles his own investigation into the Bidens and other top Washington figures.

""And you write about Republicans in your book [too],"" Levin said.

FOX NEWS OPINION: PETER SCHWEIZER: BIDEN UKRAINE DEALINGS -- 7 ESSENTIAL FACTS

""Absolutely, they don't want to hear any of it,"" Schweizer said of the same figures in Washington who are outraged over the contents of President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

Schweizer added Trump appears to be held to a different standard because he is not beholden to what he called the District of Columbia's standard ""business model.""

""One of the reasons that there was so much animosity towards Trump... is he represents a massive disruption to the business model of Washington, D.C.,"" he said, characterizing practices inside the Beltway as a cycle of enriching oneself and one's friends while serving in office and ""cash[ing] in even further"" when they leave public service.

""If it's not possible to investigate Joe Biden now, then it's never possible to investigate him,"" he told Levin. ""His son flew with him on Air Force Two -- he [the former vice president] was the point person on critically important national security issues with foreign governments.""

Schweizer also criticized the press for giving scant attention to Hunter Biden's business overseas while his father was vice president.

""The media doesn't seem to think this is a big deal,"" he said.

With evidence suggesting that Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine posed a conflict of interest for his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, some Biden defenders are deploying talking points meant to deflect from the troubling facts. But some of these talking points – regularly repeated in the news media – do not hold up to a fact check.

TRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT

Here are three talking points being used to defend the Bidens:

Point 1: There was an “absolute wall” between Hunter Biden’s business and Vice President Biden.

At a campaign stop last month, Joe Biden claimed to have an “absolute wall” between himself and his family’s business. He said: “There will be an absolute wall between personal and private [business interests] and the government.... That’s why I never talked with my son or my brother or anyone else – even distant family – about their business interests. Period.”

Biden’s “absolute wall” clearly has holes. In an interview with The New Yorker earlier this year, Hunter recalled discussing his work at Burisma, a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company, with his father on at least one occasion.

On a separate occasion, Devon Archer – Hunter’s longtime business partner and fellow Burisma director – met privately with Vice President Biden at the White House hours after first receiving payment from Burisma.

While in office, Vice President Biden was certainly aware of Hunter’s role at Burisma, because his office was specifically asked in 2014 about the potential conflict of interest. A spokesperson for vice president’s office defended Hunter’s right to do business in Ukraine as “a private citizen and a lawyer.""

Apparently, the potential conflict with U.S. foreign policy wasn’t sufficient reason to reign Hunter in. In fact, the younger Biden didn’t step down from Burisma until earlier this year – when it became an issue for his father’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

While in office, Vice President Biden was certainly aware of Hunter’s role at Burisma, because his office was specifically asked in 2014 about the potential conflict of interest

Point 2: The Burisma investigation doesn’t represent a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.

Burisma began paying Hunter Biden as a legal advisor after British authorities opened a corruption investigation into the company’s owner. Shortly afterward, Ukrainian authorities launched an investigation of their own.

Some in the media, such as the Washington Post’s fact-checker, have repeated the claim that the Burisma investigation had been “shelved” by late 2015, when Joe Biden called for the prosecutor in charge to be fired.

But according to Burisma’s own attorneys, the case was not formally closed until September 2016, months after the prosecutor was fired. Others, such as Transparency International, say the matter remained open until November 2016.

The truth is that the investigation continued for years after Hunter was hired, all while Vice President Biden played an active role in U.S. relations with Ukraine.

Point 3: This is all a phony scandal being stirred up by Trump’s allies.

Some news outlets have gone so far as to dismiss the entire Burisma story as baseless spin drummed up by the Trump campaign. In reality, the Burisma issue predates the Trump administration.

Long before Burisma emerged as a campaign issue, I published “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,” which detailed the extent of Biden corruption in Ukraine.

Prior to that, many of the same outlets now dismissing the allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine had been critical of Hunter’s work. Reporters from The New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal all wrote critically of Hunter’s new job.

Now, some of those same writers are accusing those currently examining and discussing Burisma of conducting a partisan smear.

Have the basic facts of the story changed since it was first reported? No – only the politics surrounding it.

The party has worked tirelessly to create an issue worthy of impeaching the president—Russia collusion, obstruction of justice, Stormy Daniels, tax returns. This week Democrats jettisoned all that in favor of the only issue that implicates their own front-runner for the nomination. Genius.

The one person who has been as much in the news this week as Donald Trump is former Vice President Joe Biden. It’s a dubious accomplishment. The only way to discuss Mr. Trump’s nonsmoking-gun phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is to acknowledge the subject of the ruckus: Mr. Biden’s glaring conflicts of interest during his vice presidency vis-à-vis his son Hunter’s business interests. Since Democrats insist on making this all about Ukraine, get ready for daily new revelations about the young Mr. Biden’s questionable activities and “Quid Pro Joe’s” involvement.

This is why the former vice president’s promises that this scandal will fade are nonsense. True, the media is doing double-duty on his behalf. Its general line is that Mr. Biden’s conflicts are fine; asking about them is corrupt. We are seeing a lot of stories about how Democrats are determined not to let Republicans “Hillary” Mr. Biden—a historical rewrite that places the blame for Mrs. Clinton’s notorious ethical travails on her rivals. The “fact checkers” are out in force with soothing assurances that there’s no evidence any Biden broke the law.

The problem for Joe Biden is that outright criminality is not necessary for these stories to stink. The appearance of conflict of interest is bad enough, and there is plenty of it. Mr. Biden knew his son worked for Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, and knew the company faced scrutiny. He nonetheless in 2016 had the Ukrainian prosecutor who oversaw that investigation fired. In 2013 the vice president took Hunter on a government plane to China, where Hunter met with business associates, a moment that even a former senior Obama White House aide admitted in a July New Yorker profile “invited questions about whether [Hunter] ‘was leveraging access.’ ”

Asked Thursday night at a campaign event in New Hampshire whether the son or daughter of a vice president should have business dealings abroad, businessman Andrew Yang said, “It certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term. And that's really the way it would be under my administration,” he added.

But Yang said Friday in an interview with Fox News that his comments the previous night were not an implicit criticism of Biden.

“If you look at when he was vice president, were there any rules against your family members being on the boards of foreign companies? I believe there were not. So nothing was amiss,” he said.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet – in a interview published Thursday by Politico – said, ""I think it’d be better not to have that kind of arrangement.”

But Bennet said the issue of Biden and his son Hunter paled in comparison to what Trump did in a July phone call with Ukraine’s president.

“I think it is distracting us from where we should be focused, which is on Donald Trump's calling up a foreign leader and tell him to investigate one of his political opponents. No matter what Hunter Biden did, it is hard for me to imagine that it's not 1 million times more benign than that,” Bennet emphasized.

WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T LET THE CHILD OF HER VP SIT ON A FOREIGN COMPANY'S BOARD

On Wednesday, one of Biden's top rivals, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, quickly answered “no” when asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on a foreign firm's board.

Still, to date, none of the Democratic presidential candidates have played into the president’s playbook of trying to turn the tables on Biden over his son's work.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Questions have been raised by Republicans over how Biden pushed as vice president in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – as a matter of record, he had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office by other nations – was later dismissed.

Trump’s reelection campaign on Friday launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his actions.

GABBARD REVERSES COURSE, BACKS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Meanwhile, the entire field of Democratic presidential candidates is now fully supporting the House Democrats' move this week launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the Ukrainian scandal.

The final holdout in the record-setting roster of White House hopefuls – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – came on board on Friday."

Well, we now have the rough transcript for Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and it's clear that, once again, Democrats got ahead of the evidence.

Keep in mind, when this story broke, The Washington Post reported ""two former U.S. officials"" said ""Trump's interaction with the foreign leader included a 'promise' that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint.""

JESSICA TARLOV: TRUMP IS ABUSING HIS POWER FOR PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAIN

Well, it turns out Trump makes no ""promise"" anywhere in the transcript. He makes no threats, either. Indeed, it was Zelensky who raised the issue of investigating corruption, not Trump. ""We wanted to drain the swamp here in our country ... You are a great teacher for us and in that,"" he told the president.

NBC's Katy Tur claimed that the transcript showed Trump said, ""Will you do me a favor and investigate Vice President [Joe] Biden's son?"" No, he didn't. When Trump asked Zelensky to ""do us a favor,"" it had nothing to do with Biden.

According to the transcript, Trump was asking Zelensky to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe that is being led by U.S. Attorney John Durham, a career prosecutor.

A Justice Department spokesman says Durham is ""exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.""

In his complaint, the whistleblower (who admits ""I was not a direct witness to most of the events described"") describes Trump asking Zelensky to cooperate with this investigation as an effort ""to advance his personal interests."" That is ridiculous. Since when is it inappropriate for the president of the United States to ask a foreign leader to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation?

The transcript also backs up Trump's claim that he put a temporary hold on some U.S. military aid to Ukraine because he was concerned that the European allies were not doing enough. During the call, Trump tells Zelensky the United States is doing ""much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

Zelensky responds: ""Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100 percent, but actually 1,000 percent."" He tells Trump that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron ""are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine,"" and says that ""the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union.""

The whistleblower offers no evidence that Trump had any other motivation.

What about Biden? Multiple news reports suggested Trump ""repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden's son."" Turns out Trump only mentions Biden by name toward the end of the call.

Trump tells Zelensky: ""The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me.""

Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. But the reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used U.S. aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was ""normal"" and ""nobody pushed me.""

In the complaint, the whistleblower alleges that efforts by White House officials to ""lock down"" the transcript are evidence of presidential wrongdoing. Or maybe they are evidence officials did not want yet another presidential conversation to leak.

No president in modern times has seen more of his conversations with foreign leaders leak than Trump, including calls with Australian then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, British then-Prime Minister Theresa May, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Little wonder the administration takes measures to restrict access to transcripts of those conversations.

The irony is, thanks to Democrats' impeachment push, the president is going to get his investigation of Biden's son – except it won't be carried out by Ukraine, but by the U.S. Congress.

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And that is the president of the United States talking about the push for impeachment, there's inquiry on it (ph) right now. The story's raging on all these channels. And Brad Parscale, the man in charge of taking this information, the current state of the economy and the country, and getting the president four more years.

He is in charge of the Trump 2020 reelection campaign and he's walking his dog. So we're going to hear a slice of Brad Parscale's life as well as his profession.

Brad, thanks so much for doing this.

BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: Hey, Brian. How are you, bud?

KILMEADE: Good, good. So everyone's talking about the Democrats, they're energized because of this impeachment inquiry and what happened yesterday.

What has it done for Trump 2020?

PARSCALE: Well, I mean, I think one of the most amazing things is just the fundraising we've had in the last 48 hours. I mean, as soon as they -- they started this attack, I think Americans, and -- and Republicans, and supporters of the president all over the country, they started voting with their wallet.

And you know, this is the one thing they can do right now. They can donate. And we've had just thousands and thousands and nearly millions of dollars in donations come in (ph). Sometimes -- many first-time donors. To just see the hypocrisy and the things they're doing right now, and they're upset that their vote is being stolen.

KILMEADE: You know, there was a sense that the more you pushed on the -- if you pushed for impeachment after the Mueller probe, it was good for the president.

But this is something brand new, it's -- everything's happening quicker, maybe it's more understandable.

Does that worry you?

PARSCALE: No, I'm not worried at all. I'm actually -- if you -- if you saw my statements, I'm pretty confident.

Look, the president was sent there from the people to actually deal with this kind of, you know, corruption and to -- and to fight the swamp, and that's what he's doing.

He's doing exactly what the people sent him there to do. And I think -- I don't think one American is going punish him for that.

And the Democrats just know they can't beat him in 2020, so they want to try to use anything they can and lie and cheat to defeat it.

KILMEADE: And that is proof that you did tell the truth. You are walking your dog and he seemed to be startled by something.

PARSCALE: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

KILMEADE: We'll cover that story, get a correspondent on it.

A couple other things, how close -- have you been in touch with the president?

I will tell you my observation. He had an unbelievably productive United Nations series of meetings.

I know international relations don't usually mean poll numbers, but I think he was really disheartened in his final press conference. He was as subdued as I've (ph) seen him.

I know you could easily say I'm wrong, but you know him as well as anybody. Could you give insight (ph) --

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: Can you give me his mindset?

PARSCALE: So I think, first of all -- I mean, like -- you know, I think, like, Merkel and some of these people only did like two or three bilaterals.

I mean, this is how hard the president is working. He's, like, doing 10 -- 11, I think in one day. I mean, he -- he wants to do three times as much as anybody else, plus one.

And that's -- that's just his mindset. I've known him for so long. He always wants to do a little more. There's always more I can do today.

I talked about this from the last rallies, the last days of the 2016 election to U.N. meetings, he's a fighter and he wants to do more.

Look, I don't think he's -- I don't think he's stepped (ph) one step back from this.

He's -- as you saw yesterday in his -- in his -- in his press conference -- hey, sorry -- in his press conference that he's ready to fight.

And he wants to -- he wants to -- he wants to support the American people. Sorry. We're walking by a dog.

KILMEADE: No, I understand. What kind of dog do you have?

PARSCALE: I have -- I have two Labradoodles. My wife picked them out. They're like -- but (ph) they're labs and they just -- they're funny dogs.

KILMEADE: Right. I mean, did you hear the creator of the Labradoodle feels as though they created Frankenstein and they regret doing it?

(LAUGHTER)

PARSCALE: No, they're good dogs. One of them is 9-months-old though, so he gets a little frisky when he walks by dogs.

KILMEADE: The president's got an agenda left.

Number one, the USMCA, he's looking at some type of gun legislation. He -- the White House reached out to Senator Murphy.

He also -- there's talk about doing something on the vaping with the new revelations, and the -- and the 12 deaths and the 400 who've been sickened.

What -- what do you want him -- just from a pure pollster perspective, what do you want to see him tackle?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think one thing everybody needs to understand with this president, he's about personal freedom. You know, like he's going to -- he's going to protect the Second Amendment. He's always going to do that.

He's going to protect the personal freedom of you to -- you know, to vape. I think those are things that he wants. He wants to make sure -- but he also cares about people's safety and children. And I think he's -- he's bothered personally by, you know, some of the young people that have been affected by this.

But overall, everything about him is about personal freedom. And we're the party of freedom. And the other party wants to take things away and control what you can and can't do, from -- even if that's a plastic straw in your -- in your drink.

They want to tell you how to live -- they want -- how much sugar you can have, everything else.

We believe that -- and I -- and I truly believe the Republican Party is the party of freedom.

KILMEADE: So you think cracking down with kids under 18, but letting people do what they want to do. Whether it's chewing tobacco, smoking, smoking cigars, you don't want to touch that. But you do -- you would -- you would like to see him maybe go into the education of the high schools and controlling these companies from advertising?

PARSCALE: Yes, look, I think -- I think we always as adults have to protect our children. But yes, I also don't think that -- you know, I think protecting personal freedom is very important.

And it's why -- you know when I -- when I got into this -- I was in politics before this, when I started seeing the Democrats just want to tell us how we live, what we do, everything -- they control it (ph) because they're smarter than us.

I just knew that President Trump was the right person was the right person to make sure that we're protected. And he's going to do that. He's going to protect our Second Amendment also.

KILMEADE: Brad Parscale in charge of Trump 2020 has been working extremely hard with some very unique, cutting-edge ways of doing it.

Number one is setting up a monster list of anyone who's ever gone to a rally or expressed interest. They're on his tweet list or his text list.

PARSCALE: Yes.

KILMEADE: So Brad, guns is a dicey issue, and I understand there's some friction in the House -- within the White House in that the suburban moms are now for the first time in favor of some type of legislation that might make their kids at school safer and their community safer. And we also know how much the NRA and gun rights Second Amendment means to Republicans.

Is there a sweet spot?

PARSCALE: Look, I mean that's something for the White House to talk about. I don't -- I'm not going to get into legislation with you.

But, like, I think that -- I think this electorate and the people who are going to come out and vote for Donald Trump just want to make sure that they don't start down a slippery slope of trying to remove their personal freedoms.

And I think the president's going to protect that at all costs. While at the same time --

KILMEADE: When you -- right.

PARSCALE: -- he wants to protect the -- I mean, he wants to protect children. He wants to do what's -- he wants to do it (ph) right.

And doing what Beto wants to do and come take guns is the craziest thing ever. And that's not how we make our -- our world safer. That's just -- that's just psychotic talk.

KILMEADE: The emergence of Warren over Biden, does that make you happier?

PARSCALE: Look, I think -- I think Warren is -- I think Warren's continuing to rise. I think she's -- she will be the nominee, that -- I have said that for, I think, five months and people thought I was crazy.

And if you look at the trends, she continues to rise while he continues to fall. And I -- and I think this -- you know, the corruption of Hunter Biden and what happened with, you know, getting millions from China and Ukraine and everywhere else while his father is the vice president.

You know - the millions (ph) - the Biden's have made (ph) office is a corruptional -- take them down Democrat Party. I've always said he was never going to increase one point. He was only going to decrease.

Since -- since his announcement, he's never gone up one point. I think he's only gone down. And that's what Biden does every time he's ever run.

""The more I read about this- no, I don't think he was doing something terrible in Ukraine, but it's just- why can't politicians tell their f-----' kids, 'Get a job, get a godd--n job!''""

That is why I predicted impeachment would be their ultimate resistance expression.

MARC THIESSEN: DEM IMPEACHMENT ACCUSATIONS AGAINST TRUMP NOT SUPPORTED BY TRANSCRIPT OF TRUMP-ZELENSKY CALL

As you consider the actions of Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Nadler, Adam Schiff and others, here are the 10 things you need to know about the Ukraine construct they are using to justify their latest actions.

1. Democrats think Joe Biden is immune. The Democrats are saying that the Trump White House and Department of Justice cannot get information from the Ukraine on Biden because he is running for president and therefore is Trump's rival. By their logic, therefore, Joe Biden is immune from a federal investigation while he runs for office against President Trump. How very convenient and absurd.

2. We now know that contrary to news reports and Democrats talking points, the Trump call transcript does NOT indicate Trump withheld aid in exchange for election help against Biden. There was no quid pro quo. The Democrats sold a false story.

The D.C. Democrats want to impeach Trump for activities that pale in comparison to what people in their party have been doing for years.

3. The Trump call transcript also indicates that the current Ukraine government is more than troubled about the Bidens' actions vis-a-vis the Ukraine and on their own is continuing to investigate that activity. In addition to that, the President of Ukraine continues to say there was no pressure from Trump to do anything related to that investigation.

4. A non-tortured reading of the Trump call transcript indicates that Trump asked for assistance with an ongoing DOJ investigation, which, Andrew McCarthy rightly said, is not a violation of the law. Indeed, there is a treaty between the U.S. and the Ukraine that was signed by President Bill Clinton that is entitled the Treaty with Ukraine on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. That treaty binds the respective countries to provide ""documents, records and other items"" to each other upon request.

5. “Ukrainian prosecutors say they have tried to get this information to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) since the summer of 2018, fearing it might be evidence of possible violations of U.S. ethics laws” related to the Bidens.

In other words, long before Trump made a call, the Ukraine wanted to provide the U.S. information on the Bidens.

6. The Obama administration pressured “Ukraine’s prosecutors to drop an investigation into the Burisma Holdings gas company that employed Hunter Biden and to look for new evidence in a then-dormant criminal case against eventual Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, a GOP lobbyist.”

7. The Obama White House and DNC directly solicited Ukrainian officialsto get involved in the 2016 campaign by asking for dirt on Manafort and by asking Ukrainian President to speak on U.S. soil negatively about Paul Manafort. That is far worse than what the Democrat allege Trump to have done.

8. Hunter Biden, who is generally incompetent and was kicked out of the Navy for drug use, made millions off contemporaneous to trips he made with his father when Biden was VP. The Democrats see no problem with that. Imagine if Donald Trump Jr. did that. Those payments absolutely were made to buy influence in the Obama Administration and are more than likely at the center of the Ukrainian prosecutor, that Joe Biden got fired after saying he would withhold aid, “was making plans to question Hunter Biden about $3 million in fees that Biden and his partner, Archer, collected from Burisma through their American firm.” According to that prosecutor: “The truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors.”

9. The so-called whistleblower was fed the information by others and his attorney worked for Hillary and Schumer. Doesn’t that sound non-biased to you?

10. Finally, anyone on TV who jumped to the conclusion that Trump broke the law was trying to make a headline not a reasoned judgment with all the facts.

In short, the D.C. Democrats want to impeach Trump for activities that pale in comparison to what people in their party has been doing for years.

That is par for the course from them these days and a disgrace to the Constitution.

Weld was talking about the president’s conversations with his Ukrainian counterpart. Trump has admitted that he urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden for corruption. Former Vice President Biden, of course, is a favorite to emerge as the Democrats’ 2020 nominee opposing Trump.

For most of us, the potential removal of a president of the United States over misconduct allegations may seem extraordinarily grave, having never happened and rarely been tried lo these 230 years of constitutional governance. For former governor Weld, though, grounds for Trump’s impeachment are so matter-of-factly to be assumed that he’s moved beyond them.

Way beyond them.

Trump, he asserts (and I’m not kidding, though I wish I were), may need to be put to death.

Other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known, beyond the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint about that call.

TRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMOCRATS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT

The whistleblower complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, alleges that White House officials said they were “directed” by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept.

The whistleblower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower also said that, according to White House officials, it was “not the first time” a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information. The complaint alleged that the White House tried to “restrict access” to records of the call.

“In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down’ all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced—as customary—by the White House Situation Room,” the whistleblower stated.

The White House released an unclassified version of that transcript of the call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the Bidens.

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings—where his son, Hunter Biden, was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

But the whistleblower’s complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that the concerns were based on second-hand information.

The White House lawyers’ directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top Democrats as a “cover-up.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was prompted by Ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, called the move a “cover-up” and said it would be part of the impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow downplayed the importance of the record-keeping details.

KARL ROVE: PELOSI WAS FORCED TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Trump's July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered a whistleblower complaint that touched off a political tempest in Washington, D.C. The complaint was released publicly Thursday, alleging Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

Some Democrats allege Trump implicitly sought a quid pro quo - by trying to trade U.S. military aid for dirt on Biden - but the White House has vigorously denied it.

Cruz said House Democrats are still angry about the 2016 election and are doing everything they can to uproot the president from office.

“Who’s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to spy,” Trump said in audio obtained by the Los Angeles Times from a private event with diplomatic officials in New York. “You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

The comments led several Democratic house committee members to accuse Trump of “witness intimidation.”

WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN 'INTERFERENCE' IN ELECTION

“That kind of incitement to violence is only going to chill other witnesses when they come forward,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said, according to The Times. “And that is its very intent, to intimidate the witnesses.""

The whistleblower, in a complaint declassified Thursday, said they were not a “direct witness” to most of the events in the complaint, but wrote that they had received information from more than half a dozen White Hosue and other U.S. government officials who alleged Trump “is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

The complaint was turned over to the Inspector General who found it credible and of urgent concern but it was not initially shared with Congress.

The allegations center on a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

DEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”

TIME OUT: MAN, HOLES

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

A LITTLE ON THE NOSE, DON’T YOU THINK?

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”

Clinton, who ran against Trump in 2016, added that she supports the House of Representatives' newly launched impeachment inquiry.

""My view is that, given the latest revelation, which is such a blatant effort to use his presidential position to advance his personal and political interests, there should be an impeachment inquiry opened,"" Clinton told CBS News. ""And I think, sadly, there are a number of grounds. But this one is incredibly troubling.""

She was referring to the dust-up over a July call between Trump and his counterpart in Ukraine, in which he asked for an inquiry into onetime Vice President Joe Biden, Biden's son Hunter, and their dealings there.

""I believe that -- look there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again. And I’m hoping that both the public and press understand the way Trump plays the game,” she told CBS.

Clinton appeared to empathize with Biden, saying ""the most outrageously false things"" were said about her during the 2016 election and suggested the same thing is happening to the former vice president, seen as a potential 2020 Trump rival for the White House.

“Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty,” he tweeted.

SCHIFF SLAMMED FOR CHALKING UP 'DISTURBING' FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TO 'PARODY'

He continued, “Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

The dramatic reading happened Thursday when Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the whistleblower complaint about the call that touched off a formal impeachment inquiry this week.

The complaint and the transcript of that call, both released this week, detailed how Trump urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call, according to the transcript. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

But at the hearing, Schiff, D-Calif., offered an exaggerated version of the call.

“I have a favor I want from you,” Schiff said while appearing to read from a piece of paper. “And I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.”

Schiff later chalked up his fictional summary of the phone call to a joke as he came under fire from conservatives for making up quotes.

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody,"" Schiff said. ""The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, ‘If you don’t understand me I’m going to say it seven more times,’ my point is, that’s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.""

Trump on Friday was not buying that claim, however.

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,” he tweeted.

Schiff quickly responded to Trump’s tweet with one of his own, accusing him of trying to cover up a “shakedown.”

A telling decision by Schiff, a capable former prosecutor: If you have an extortionate conversation, you quote it. If you need to imagine it into something it isn’t, that means it is not an extortionate conversation.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: TRIANGULATING MANAFORT -- OBAMA, CLINTON AND UKRAINE

Also telling: Chairman Schiff came flying out of the starting block describing how overwhelmingly dependent Ukraine is on the United States and its president. Of course, this fact must be forced to the fore because it is not obvious from the Trump-Zelensky conversation — again, Schiff does not have evidence that Trump extorted Zelensky for the purpose of aiding Trump’s 2020 campaign.

But more to the point, the relationship of dependency intensified in 2015 due to the flight to Moscow of Ukraine’s president, Viktor Yanukovych. At that point, a new Ukrainian government more to the Obama administration’s liking, under President Petro Poroshenko, came to power.

The new government was desperate for American help, financially and security-wise, which is why Vice President Joe Biden was in a position to pressure it into firing the prosecutor who was conducting a corruption investigation of Burisma, the energy company that had appointed Hunter Biden to its board and was lavishly compensating him.

In “Ball of Collusion,” I outline some of the extensive evidence that in 2016, the Obama administration’s law enforcement agencies pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to revive a dormant corruption investigation of Paul Manafort. I summarized the matter in an excerpt for Fox News a few days back.

The chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees initially requested a laundry list of documents on Sept. 9 and sent a follow-up letter on Monday.

""Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry,"" wrote Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.; Foreign Affairs chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.; and Oversight chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md.

The chairmen asked for State Department correspondence and documents dating from Jan. 20, 2017, to the present. The documents relate to reports that Trump pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the Bidens' business activity in Ukraine.

The Democratic lawmakers also demanded any copies of the transcript of Trump's July 25 controversial call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and a list of State Department officials who might have been involved with the conversation, according to the letter. The chairmen are additionally requesting any State Department records about Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and any records that relate to U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

They said Pompeo has until Oct. 4, to comply with the requests.

In a separate letter, the chairmen notified Pompeo that they had scheduled depositions for five State Department officials between Oct. 2 and Oct. 10. Those officials are former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

All of the officials except Kent are named in a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

""The failure of any of these department employees to appear for their scheduled depositions shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry,"" the chairmen said.

Trump has called the impeachment probe, which centers on his policy toward Ukraine, ""another witch hunt,"" and has repeatedly said his call with Zelensky was ""perfect."" He has also adamantly denied withholding military aid from the Eastern European country as a condition of a probe of the Bidens.

He pushed back against media reports questioning his call with Ukraine again on Friday, tweeting, ""If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can ever again speak to another foreign leader!""

Zelensky said this week that ""nobody pushed me"" during his July call with Trump.

A memorandum of the call was made public Wednesday. It shows that while Trump sought an investigation into the Biden family for corruption, the president did not explicitly leverage military aid as had been suggested.

The initial whistleblower complaint was forwarded to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26.

The House intelligence committee released a redacted version of the complaint Thursday ahead of testimony from Maguire, who acknowledged that the complaint alleged serious wrongdoing by the president but said it was not his role to judge whether the allegations were credible or not.

Maguire said he was unfamiliar with any other whistleblower complaint in American history that ""touched on such complicated and sensitive issues."" He praised the whistleblower as having acted honorably, said he recognized the complaint as immediately sensitive and important and insisted the White House did not direct him to withhold it from Congress.

""I believe that everything in this matter here is totally unprecedented,"" he said.

During a “regularly scheduled” and “routine” phone call on Aug. 14, CIA General Counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood notified John Demers, the top official in the Justice Department’s National Security Division, of the issue, a source familiar with the sequence of events told Fox News.

TRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT

According to the source, Demers contacted Elwood the next day for more information and then went to the White House to read the transcribed notes from Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Demers then shared the information with other top Justice Department officials and discussed next steps.

According to the source, Attorney General Bill Barr was not involved in the conversations or informed on the matter at that point. It is unclear when Barr was briefed on the matter, but at least one senior Justice Department official was made aware of the call and concerns surrounding it that day.



Fox News has learned that during the weekly call between Demers and Elwood on Aug.14th, there were also other officials on the call, including at least one White House official. At the end of the call Elwood brought up a potential issue she had heard about a White House phone call. The White House official on the call mentioned that there was a transcript of the call and that is how Demers ultimately ended up at the White House the next day to review the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call.



The following week, beginning on Aug.19th, there was confusion among Demers and other officials at the Department of Justice because the CIA had made them aware of the phone call and a potential complaint, but the CIA had not made an actual referral to the DOJ, leaving the Department without a clear path, according to a person familiar with the sequence of events.



The situation was ultimately resolved on Aug. 26th when the DOJ received the complaint from the Director of National Intelligence and the intelligence community inspector general.

The official whistleblower complaint regarding that call had already been transmitted to the intelligence community inspector general at that point. The IG has reported receiving that information on Aug. 12.

But the DOJ apparently learned of the concerns days before the complaint was formally turned over by the IG. The inspector general relayed the complaint to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26, who then referred the matter to the Justice Department for review of executive privilege in the contents of the phone call.

Maguire testified on his handling of the matter on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee, defending his actions and citing the “unprecedented” nature of the matter.

The timeline of when the Justice Department first learned of the call was first reported by CNN on Thursday. The names of the officials involved in those initial discussions were not known until now.

The phone call is now at the heart of Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry into the president, announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week.

INTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING

The White House released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on notes and recollections of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.

Trump first asked Zelensky to do a “favor” and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that [Joe] Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokrin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

The whistleblower’s complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, alleged that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, and claimed that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to intervene in the 2020 presidential election. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that this was based on second-hand information.

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, Trump allies note that it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid—which had been frozen days earlier. Biden is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.

On the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Wednesday, Trump met with Zelensky, who was asked by reporters about whether he felt pressured by Trump on the phone call this summer.

“I think you read everything. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the U.S.A.,” Zelensky said. “We had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.”

He added: “Nobody pushed me.”"

The media have been clamoring to remove Trump from office since he was elected. Here’s a great compilation of just a few examples across 35 months.

When the anti-Trump media weren’t promoting impeachment, CNN was pushing what anchor Wolf Blitzer called “questions about the president's mental fitness” and 25th Amendment solutions as another way to oust Trump.

CNN SHAMES GOP SENATORS WHO 'NEED MORE INFO' ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

Now they will do anything they need to support any effort to send Trump into political retirement. That includes either skipping stories that undermine the impeachment effort or censoring massive chunks of text to manipulate the result.

Remember when we had the missing 18-minute gap in the Watergate tapes? Now we have the missing 540 words of the Ukraine transcript. The big difference is the media complained about the first gap and created the second gap all their own, to establish a phony narrative about President Trump asking the Ukrainian president for a favor.

I credit the word tally to The Federalist, which analyzed the transcript against the narrative manufactured by the press. The site pointed out how journalists jumped from the Trump’s initial request in the call “to do us a favor” all the way down to a completely separate section where he wanted to “talk about Biden's son.”

What Trump was actually asking about in the “favor” section was computer hacking and a company named Crowdstrike. The Biden stuff came later.

The press didn’t care. Journalist after journalist flat-out lied about what Trump said. MSNBC, CNN, NPR. It didn’t matter the outlet, they pushed the same narrative.

MSNBC anchor Katy Tur was one of the worst. (Shocker, I know.) She just made up what Trump said and viewers who didn’t check the transcript would have easily been deceived. She claimed Trump asked: “Will you do me a favor and investigate Vice President Biden’s son? Will you do me a favor and get involved in the 2020 election? Vice President Biden is my chief political opponent.”

In fact, Trump said nothing about the election or Biden being his opponent. He commented how “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution,” which is true. (Here’s the video.)

That didn’t stop Blitzer, who explained the situation this way: “In the ... this summary that was released by the White House, the president specifically quoted as saying to the Ukrainian president, ‘I would like you to do us a favor’ and then goes into an investigation into the Bidens and the Democrats.” Blitzer skipped over the same words as the others.

Broadcast news was no different. “CBS Evening News” Chief Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes used a nearly identical synopsis of the call: “Mr. Trump asked the president of Ukraine for a favor, to look into campaign rival Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter.”

And when journalists weren’t making up their own fictional accounts, they were largely ignoring the made-up accounts of Hill Democrats. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., fictionalized the call during the hearing and few in the press even noted it.

Schiff said: “I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it.” Fact-check obsessed reporters didn’t care.

That’s because the media are thrilled. MSNBC host Chris Matthews told “Morning Joe,” ""they've got him!"" That’s their mindset. Not news.

Live by the tweet …

You’ve probably never heard of Cancel Culture, but you’ve seen it happening all around you. Essentially, it’s when the Internet mob and some media outlets gang up on people to try and destroy their lives.

Newer lefty outlets like BuzzFeed have popularized it, but major media outlets do it, too. Which brings us to the Des Moines Register’s attempt to destroy the life of 24-year-old Carson King. The Iowa State football fan and beer drinker held up a sign saying “Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished” during ESPN’s “College GameDay.” He included a link to send him money and, remarkably, people did just that.

He was given so much money that he decided to donate it to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital. Corporate support soon followed — including Anheuser-Busch — and the total topped $1 million.

AXED DES MOINES REGISTER REPORTER BLAMES 'RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGUES' FOR FIRING, SUGGESTS HE'S OPPRESSED

The Register decided to profile King. Reporter Aaron Calvin dug into King’s tweets to find inappropriate comments he made when he was 16. King was remorseful, but that wasn’t good enough for the Register, which included the old tweets in its profile.

King beat them to the punch and held a press conference apologizing. The story came out and many on Twitter were unhappy, to say the least. The Register went into damage control mode. It released a statement explaining the story process and saying “editors decided we would include the information.”

Twitter users soon uncovered that Calvin – the reporter who wrote the story – had his own offensive tweets, including a version of the N-word. The Washington Post described those comments as “troubling posts that mocked same-sex marriage, made light of abuse against women and used a racial slur.”

Readers were furious. Register Executive Editor Carol Hunter wrote another piece headlined: “We hear you. You’re angry. Here’s what we are doing about it.” She told readers: “We took appropriate action.” Only they didn’t. They blamed the reporter and didn’t apologize for what they did.

According to Calvin, they told him he could quit or be fired and he chose to be fired. Hunter and others at the paper suffered no consequences for their decision to attack King over a few high school comments.

Now Calvin is whining to BuzzFeed, one of the worst advocates of Cancel Culture. According to BuzzFeed: “‘Now that gay marriage is legal,’ he wrote in one 2012 tweet, ‘I’m totally going to marry a horse.’” He also wrote “f---- all cops,” without my polite editing.

But Calvin said he feels “abandoned” by the newspaper, since “the editor knew, the editorial board knew, and the executive editor knew” how he handled the tweets. Naturally, he blamed conservatives for costing him his job, saying “this whole campaign was taken up by right-wing ideologues and largely driven by that force.”

Look for more outlets to lionize Calvin, if only to justify their own similar attempts to destroy conservatives over ancient comments.

King gets to have the last laugh. Much of the world sided with him and his charity efforts have now topped $2 million. And the only person canceled was the one who tried to cancel him.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

The House of Representatives moved forward on an impeachment inquiry this week, though they have not held a formal vote on the matter. Democrats accuse President Trump of abusing his office by requesting that Ukraine investigate his potential 2020 election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Trump's July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered a whistleblower complaint that touched off a political tempest in Washington, D.C. The complaint was released publicly on Thursday, alleging Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

Earlier on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that Attorney General William Barr has ""gone rogue,"" alleging there was an attempted ""cover-up"" of the whistleblower complaint.

""He’s gone rogue,"" Pelosi said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" after host Joe Scarborough asked if she was concerned that the country's institutions could fail due to Barr's behavior.

""I think where they are going is the cover-up of the cover-up, and that's very really sad for them.

""I thought it was an interesting point and I think there might be something to it,"" she added while speaking on ""MSNBC Live.""

Her comments came as new polls showed Warren beating both Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the Democratic primary calendar. Sanders and Warren have been portrayed as the standard-bearers for the Democrats' far-left wing.

The debate is being hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – which had lower criteria to qualify – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. Ten candidates faced off on one night in this month’s third round debate, for which the thresholds were raised."

The president's comments came as House Democrats continued investigating the Trump administration and pursued an official impeachment inquiry surrounding his July phone call with Ukraine's president. Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into corruption suspicions surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic party's frontrunner for challenging Trump in 2020.

On Thursday, Schiff pressed Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on his decision to not to relay a whistleblower complaint about that call. Instead of sending the complaint to the inspector general, Maguire notified the White House.

Both Schiff and ""Squad"" members have painted the transcript of that call as damning evidence that Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.

Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif, said on Fox Business Network Thursday that the trip mostly concerns the European Reassurance Initiative, which invests billions supporting European allies -- mostly in Eastern Europe -- in response to the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Garamendi is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on readiness.

INTEL CHIEF MAGUIRE DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, CALLS ISSUE ‘UNPRECEDENTED’

“In the intervening time we have the president pulling $770 million out of that program, and these are critical infrastructure so that our troops can actually engage if ever necessary in Eastern Europe, and of course we were going to do the Ukraine thing looking at the military support that we're giving,” he said on ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast.""

He said that trip was planned four months ago, but noted that it has now become “all tied up in this impeachment issue.”

He was referring to the controversy surrounding the newly revealed phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. The transcript of the call was released this week after a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

The allegation has escalated Democratic calls for Trump’s impeachment, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announcing a formal inquiry this week. Democrats allege that the call indicates a quid pro quo, with Trump holding military spending in return for an investigation into a political opponent. The transcript, though, does not show Trump explicitly linking the two. The money was eventually delivered.

On CNN Friday morning, Garamendi said the delegation is hoping to meet with political leaders in Kiev, including the defense minister, but said that “given all of the disruption it remains to be seen exactly how that goes.”

“The question there is Ukraine is a critical ally. Ukraine has been invaded by Russia. What does all of this mean to Ukraine, how can we make sure that they get the assistance that they need to continue to push back against Russia and ultimately be successful and push Russia out of Ukraine?” he said.

However, Garamendi also said that he believed a quid pro quo was relayed, and didn’t rule out speaking to officials about the Biden matter. He has previously said he intends to “hold discussions on this matter and inquire about the conversations [Trump attorney] Rudy Giuliani and President Trump have had with Ukrainian leadership."" However, he said the delegation has to be ""very very careful"" about the subject on the trip to the country.

“Once again things are rapidly evolving here [and] what the Ukrainian government will do and how it will respond to what has got to be a major political issue for them back in Kiev remains to be seen,” he said on CNN. “And so we're going to be treading very carefully on the political side of this.”"

The impeachment inquiry House Democrats are undertaking regarding President Trump is a drastic but necessary measure of last resort to deal with a historic crisis that has put our union in peril.

The central question before Congress is whether Trump and future presidents should be considered above the law and free to take any action they deem justified, or whether they must be held accountable for their actions by Congress.

Disgraced President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 to avoid impeachment following the Watergate scandal, famously said to David Frost in a 1977 interview that his actions were justified because “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

KARL ROVE: PELOSI WAS FORCED TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

That was not the standard when Nixon was in office and it surely isn't the standard today!

In the coming House impeachment investigation of President Trump, both Democrats and Republicans have a solemn responsibility to set partisanship aside, uphold the rule of law and hold him accountable.

This critical task requires a level of patriotism that puts country over party and political wins. House members in both parties should judge Trump based on his actions, not on the fact that he is a Republican or whether they agree or disagree with his policies.

Based on evidence from a White House-released rough transcript of a July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, it seems clear that Trump conditioned nearly $400 million in congressionally allocated military aid to Ukraine on that country's willingness to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden’s son, Hunter

Disgraced President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 to avoid impeachment following the Watergate scandal, famously said to David Frost in a 1977 interview that his actions were justified because “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

Because Joe Biden is currently the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination to run against Trump in 2020 – and because Trump frequently attacks him in comments to reporters and on Twitter – there is no question that Trump is going after the former vice president to weaken him as a potential opponent.

Despite numerous allegations of misconduct against Trump going back to his days as a presidential candidate, for far too long an impeachment inquiry against him has seemed far-fetched. Conventional thinking supported a prolonged wait for the 2020 election as the first possible time he could be removed from office.

However, the breaking news of this week demonstrates that Trump must be held accountable for his potential high crimes and misdemeanors.

The inquiry into Trump’s behavior is far from a witch hunt, despite the president giving it that label. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has launched a legitimate and necessary investigation of what appears to be our president’s abuse of power for personal political gain.

With so much at stake for our nation, Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry have to get this right. Here are the five principles they should keep in mind:

Keep it simple

Impeachment, and the investigation leading up to it, is a legislative maneuver prescribed by the Constitution. It's also a court case in which the American people are the jury. Thus, House Democrats must have one clearly synced message about the nature of the inquiry and the underlying crime.

President Trump continues to state that impeachment is dead, but he is wrong. This inquiry isn't about the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or any other act by this president. It is about the Trump-Zelensky phone call and what that call reveals about Trump’s conduct.

Democrats shouldn’t use the impeachment inquiry to rack up points with their base by throwing everything they can think of against the wall, or by simply attempting to make Trump look bad. This is a serious investigation into whether or not the president broke federal laws and should be removed from office.

Don’t engage the weak White Houses political team

Over the timeline of this whistleblower's complaint, we have seen this White House flop around like a fish out of water. Officials have changed their stories so many times that it is unbelievable.

White House officials rejected both Senate and House subpoenas for the whistleblower’s complaint before flip-flopping and making it public Thursday.

And most importantly, Trump and his team seem to be losing support among some Senate Republicans. Not only did they lose a vote for emergency border wall funding because of GOP defections, but Senate Republicans joined a unanimous resolution demanding the release of the whistleblower complaint to House and Senate committees.

With the White House political shop taking on water, Democrats should focus solely on the letter of the law and avoid the political mudslinging that will likely come their way.

If this president is guilty of soliciting foreign assistance to help him win a national election, Democrats shouldn't play political games. They should let the truth come out and allow the American people to hear it without the dense cloud of the same old Washington politics.

Talk to the American people directly

Since this Ukraine scandal came to light, Trump has managed to harshly and personally attack Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Reps Adam Schiff of California, Maxine Waters of California and Al Green of Texas – all among his sharpest critics in Congress.

And the president has been attacking Joe and Hunter Biden and the integrity of the intelligence whistleblower almost nonstop.

Can you see the pattern? Trump's marquee strategy is an unholy trinity: attack the messenger, lie about the message, and distract as much as possible.

Let's not forget to mention Trump's personal lawyer and co-conspirator, Rudy Giuliani, who pillories opponents on cable TV news shows and regularly contradicts himself, changing his story.

This wildfire that the president has started isn't a 429-page Mueller report with an intricate fact pattern. This political and criminal disaster is based on one phone call, in which Trump linked foreign aid to an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden.

Democrats must stay above the fray, resist the president's distractions, and lay out an impartial case to the American people about presidential corruption and wrongdoing.

This case can't only exist in the Washington Beltway. It has to be laid out in town halls, civic centers, PTA meetings and living rooms across America. There is something here, and it will be the job of Democrats to convince the American people to take a step back, exercise patience and open their ears to the facts.

Keep working on behalf of the American people

In 2018 the American people voted for action from Washington on many of the kitchen table issues that keep them up at night: the rising cost of health care and the exploitative price of prescription drugs, blatant voter suppression, and congressional inaction to reduce deadly shootings.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

House Democrats shouldn’t let the impeachment inquiry stop them from doing their jobs. They should pass bills and work with the White House to try to reach agreement on needed legislation.

Don't rush this

With the Iowa caucuses and the 2020 election around the corner, there will be an urge to rush this impeachment inquiry. Democrats should resist that urge, and take their time.

Laying out all the facts will require time and consistency. With the potential of White House stonewalling and name-calling, any attempt to rush this inquiry will give Trump grounds for his baseless and absurd ""presidential harassment"" argument.

Democrats should let the facts marinate in the minds of American voters. They should give folks at home time to ponder the concept of presidential corruption and the blatant abuse of power by Donald Trump.

The impartial House impeachment investigation of President Nixon turned public opinion around dramatically to favor his impeachment, leading him to resign when he saw he would be removed from office in a Senate impeachment trial.

We don’t know what will happen with President Trump, but a fair and impartial impeachment inquiry of his conduct could bring us some major surprises and bad news for Trump’s prospects of keeping his job either before or more likely after the 2020 election."

With the transcript of that call and the related whistleblower complaint now public -- and the acting director of national intelligence giving his account to a House committee Thursday -- the battle between these two branches of government is truly joined. And neither side is giving an inch.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

Trump and his allies are now ramping up their attacks on Democrats, the media, the whistleblower and the various sources who fed information on the president that made its way into the complaint. House Democrats, meanwhile, are moving full speed ahead with the formal impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers plan to move quickly with their investigation -- raising the possibility of articles of impeachment before year's end.

""The presidential oath of office requires the President of the United States to do two things: Faithfully execute his or her office, and protect and defend the Constitution. The whistleblower complaint and call record provide the most graphic evidence yet Trump has done neither,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff tweeted.

All this has played out in a matter of days, with the Ukraine controversy spurring Democratic leadership into impeachment action in a way the Russia controversy did not. The White House, for its part, spent most of the week trying to clear the air. It released a transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy showing Trump urging his Kiev counterpart to ""look into"" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son—a move Democrats claim was Trump seeking assistance from a foreign power in the 2020 presidential election. The now-released whistleblower complaint on the same call included additional allegations, including claims that officials tried to hide records of the call.

But the president and his legal team are fighting back by likening the whistleblower and his or her sources to spies -- and questioning whether this is all the work of partisans.

""Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?"" Trump tweeted Friday.

He also blasted media coverage, including the New York Times' Peter Baker for his latest reporting on the call.

And he demanded the resignation of Schiff, D-Calif., for ""fraudulently"" reading out a hyperbolic account of his phone call with the Ukrainian president during a hearing on Thursday.

Trump began raising questions about the whistleblower on Thursday.

“I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information?” Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by the Los Angeles Times. “Because that’s close to a spy.”

He added: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow suggested Friday the whistleblower had assistance in writing the complaint that rocked Washington.

“Do you think the whistleblower drafted the complaint? I mean realistically?” Sekulow said on “Fox & Friends.” “Look at the phraseology, the endnotes, and the footnotes—this wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm. The American people see it as it is. Nobody has an appetite for this anymore.”

Sekulow blasted the fallout surrounding the controversy as “political theater.”

“There is no there, there,” he said. “There was no violation of law, rule or regulation.”

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

On Thursday, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Despite being pressed for hours by Democrats, Maguire maintained that the whistleblower complaint was “hearsay” and “second-hand” information—a sentiment Sekulow echoed Friday.

Sekulow also responded to allegations the White House moved call records from a computer system where they are normally kept to a system normally used for classified information.

“A cover-up? Think about that for a moment. The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It’s so secret, and such a cover-up, here’s the documents,” Sekulow said. “This is nonsense.”

The transcript itself showed Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Biden's son Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board. Biden supporters say Shokin was widely accused of corruption.

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.

Trump allies, like Sekulow, and others in the White House, have used that distinction to maintain the claim that “there was no quid pro quo.”

Meanwhile, the whistleblower also alleged that Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whom the president mentioned on the call could help Zelensky in any anti-corruption probes, was improperly involved in soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.

Giuliani, though, defended his involvement, telling Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, “I think I should get some kind of an award.”

“What they charged as Russian collusion was really Ukrainian collusion,” Giuliani said on “The Ingraham Angle” Thursday night. “I am doing an effective job of showing what phonies they are and I am uncovering what you will find to be an enormous pay for play scheme.”

Giuliani also told the Atlantic on Thursday that he thinks he deserves praise for his involvement with Ukraine.

“It is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I’m not,” he told the Atlantic. “And I will be the hero! These morons—when this is over, I will be the hero.”

But Democrats are using all of the developments as fodder as they hit the gas pedal in their impeachment proceedings. Pelosi said Friday that she did not have an exact timetable for impeachment, though noted that it could “take time.”

Pelosi also noted that the House committees involved in the process are going to probe the “cover-up” allegations while saying that Trump’s comments about the whistleblower have been “dangerous.”

“For the president to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government,” Pelosi said Friday. “But the president does that almost every day.”

The House and Senate are on recess for the next two weeks, but members plan to use this period to speak to constituents and garner support for the process.

“Congress ought to be talking to their constituents and gaining their perspective on that and why they think this is such an important facet of this ongoing investigation,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said. “I think consideration of the public’s viewpoint is critically important.”

And freshman pro-impeachment Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said members need to “go home and educate them.”

On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee posted the whistleblower report alerting officials to allegedly problematic statements President Trump made during a July 25 call with Ukraine's president. On Thursday, the committee interrogated Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, whom Democrats suggested participated in a cover-up by withholding the complaint from Congress.

Shapiro said it was absurd to claim that the Trump administration of a cover-up since a memorandum of Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released Wednesday.

During ""The Ben Shapiro Show"" on Friday, Shapiro added that Democrats held a ""miasmatic theory of impeachment"" that claimed Trump was generally corrupt and shouldn't have used his power as president to request an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential opponent in the 2020 election.

""That theory really does not hold water,"" Shapiro said, ""because the presidents are constantly talking in both their capacity as presidents and as candidates. Barack Obama did this famously in 2012 when he said to Dmitry Medvedev, then the president of Russia, that he would give the Russians flexibility after the election if they would back off for now.""

""Was that an abuse of his power? Yeah, kind of, but did that mean it was impeachable? Probably not,"" Shapiro added."

""He’s gone rogue,"" Pelosi said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" after host Joe Scarborough asked if she was concerned that the country's institutions could fail due to Barr's behavior.

""I think where they are going is the cover-up of the cover-up, and that's very really sad for them. To have a Justice Department go so rogue, they have been for a while, and now it just makes matters worse,"" said Pelosi, faulting Barr for instructing the director of national intelligence to bring the whistleblower complaint to the White House.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

Pelosi said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire ""broke the law"" by not immediately turning over the whistleblower complaint to Congress. She called Maguire a man of ""great reputation"" and said she ""felt sorry for him"" because he was placed in an ""unprecedented situation.""

House Democrats are moving full speed ahead with the impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers could file articles of impeachment before year's end.

The impeachment push comes after the public release of both the whistleblower's complaint and a transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump requested that Ukraine investigate the Biden family.

The whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. Democrats have accused Trump of an implied quid pro quo, using U.S. military aid as leverage. The White House has vigorously denied that the aid was linked to Trump's request for the investigation.

DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE

Maguire was grilled by Democrats in a tense hearing Thursday, facing repeated questions from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on why he initially withheld a copy of the complaint from lawmakers.

That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified and released to the public in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.

Maguire insisted he is ""not partisan"" and ""not political,"" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times.

Democrats hammered Maguire for bringing the whistleblower complaint to the Justice Department and the White House, since the president was the subject of the complaint and Barr was mentioned by Trump during the controversial phone call.

Maguire said he believed his response was ""prudent.""

""I believe everything in this matter is totally unprecedented,"" he said.

The president specifically attacked the complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower, who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."" Democrats, following the whistleblower's lead, have accused Trump of threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine in a July 25 call unless the Eastern European country's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, agreed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings there.

""The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called 'Whistleblower' knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong,"" said Trump.

A memorandum of the Trump-Zelensky call was made public Wednesday. It shows that while Trump sought an investigation into the Biden family for corruption, the president did not explicitly leverage military aid.

Trump again defended his call on Saturday, saying: ""The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President, who told the Fake News, at the United Nations, that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!""

While meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, Zelensky told reporters that ""nobody pushed me"" during the call with Trump.

SCHIFF SLAMMED FOR CHLAKING UP 'DISTURBING' FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TO 'PARODY'

Trump also attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., accusing him of ""fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up & twisted words into my call with the Ukrainian President to make it look like I did something very wrong. He then boldly read those words to Congress and millions of people, defaming & libeling me.""

The president then repeated his claim that Schiff ""must resign from Congress!""

In a video message earlier Saturday evening, Trump said that Democrats were ""trying to stop me because I am fighting for you!""

""The Democrats want to take away your guns, they want to take away your health care, they want to take away your vote, they want to take away your freedom, they want to take away your judges, they want to take away everything,"" Trump said.

""We can never let this happen. We’re fighting to drain the swamp and that’s exactly what I’m doing, and you see why we have to do it, because our country is at stake like never before,"" he continued.

""It’s all very simple. They’re trying to stop me because I’m fighting for you, and I’ll never let that happen,"" the president concluded.

On Saturday morning, Trump sent a series of tweets using all capital letters, saying: ""Presidential Harassment!"", ""Make America Great Again!"" and ""Keep America Great!""

He also called out several Democrats by name and said they were the ""Do Nothing Democrat Savages.""

""Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like [Jerry] Nadler, [Adam] Schiff, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me,"" Trump said. ""Oh well, maybe next time!""

TRUMP CALLS AOC, SCHIFF AND NADLER 'DEMOCRAT SAVAGES' AS IMPEACHMENT CALLS INTENSIFY

The initial whistleblower complaint was forwarded to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Maguire said the complaint alleged serious wrongdoing by the president but that it was not his role to judge whether the allegations were credible or not.

Whistle-blower says Trump aides disturbed by Ukraine call,https://www.foxnews.com/media/plot-twist-whistle-blower-says-trump-aides-disturbed-by-ukraine-call,"The plot thickens, as it always does.

Now we all get to argue about the mystery whistleblower.

The disclosure that the man who set this in motion does not support Donald Trump’s reelection—a shocker, I know—will fuel counterattacks by the president and his allies. That information comes from the New York Times describing the view of intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson. The source wants to remain anonymous, but the chances that the name doesn’t leak seem to me to be nil.

IMPEACHMENT IS RISKY, BUT TRANSCRIPT SUPPORTS MEDIA’S UKRAINE REPORTING

In fact, the Times yesterday reported yesterday that the person who filed the complaint “is a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity.”

Editor Dean Baquet, responding preemptively to possible criticism, justified the disclosure: “The role of the whistleblower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the United States abused power and whether the White House covered it up.”

Trump pounced on the secret source at a private New York breakfast, according to the Los Angeles Times. (He also called reporters “scum.” I feel this episode has strained our close relations.)

“I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information?” Trump asked. “Because that’s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

In fairness, the CIA officer did go through official channels, and the acting intelligence chief spent hours yesterday deflecting a House committee’s questions of why he didn’t move more quickly on the complaint.

I’m inclined not to care that much about the whistleblower, who had no first-hand knowledge of these matters. We already know more than he did because we’ve got the rough transcript.

But there was a key revelation in the complaint, made public yesterday. And it wasn’t that CIA man felt the president was pressuring Ukraine on Joe Biden “for personal gain.” Everyone is familiar with that charge by now.

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

No, it was that several White House officials were “deeply disturbed” by what they heard on the call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the complaint said. Which means more officials are going to be called to testify on the Hill.

What’s more, the unknown complainant claims to have information that “senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down’ all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House Situation Room.”

Needless to say, it’s harder for the president and his team to argue that this was a routine diplomatic call if some people who worked for him treated it as a hair-on-fire moment.

In fact, the scenario here is that the whistleblower wouldn’t even have known about the call had some White House officials not been upset. Instead, the source concluded that Trump “sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president’s 2020 reelection bid.”

Still, Trump tweeted yesterday that this is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” He also called it “a disgrace to our country.”

In a typical probe, the actual words spoken between the president and a foreign leader would be the last revelation of a long, bottom-up investigation, rather than something coughed up within a week of the first newspaper stories. But that means the media and Congress are having to work backwards, to reconstruct what led up to the fateful call.

And the complaint, as well as the rough transcript of the call, makes clear that Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr were key players in the Ukraine drama.

ABC quotes a former Zelensky adviser as saying after the onetime comedian was elected in April, they wanted to speak to Trump. But, said Serhiy Leshchenko, a former member of parliament, “It was clear that Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case.”

This was presumably after the first congratulatory call that Trump placed to Zelensky in April, which he’s said he is willing to release. The New York Times, quoting unnamed sources, said the president urged Zelensky to work with Giuliani in pursuing “corruption.”

So this is becoming quite the detective story. But it still can’t be separated from the politics of impeachment, and most Republicans are backing the president’s stance that the call was no big deal.

Cliff Sims, a former White House aide who in litigation with the president over a somewhat critical book, told Politico: ""Democrats overreaching has been such a political gift to Trump, over and over again. They've been screaming 'treason!' and 'impeachment!' after nearly everything that happens. Middle America is mostly numb to it.”

That is the challenge facing the House Democrats, 220 of whom now support the impeachment probe, beyond the magic number of 218. And sooner or later, the intelligence officer who preferred to remain nameless will be under a very harsh spotlight."

Republicans want to know whistleblower's White House sources, as inconsistencies in complaint emerge

Top Republicans on Thursday pushed to identify the White House officials who told a whistleblower of alleged misconduct by the Trump administration, as Democrats ramped up their impeachment inquiry -- and several apparent inconsistencies emerged in the whistleblower's complaint. Republicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower's sources in the White House didn't file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower procedures do not protect second-hand complaints.

(The New York Times reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed the Times' report.)

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News' ""Shepard Smith Reporting"" on Thursday that the administration had an apparent ""leak problem,"" adding, ""if they're leaking something that's supposed to be classified, then ... that probably is criminal in nature.""

Meanwhile, an unnamed Ukrainian official told the New York Times that Kiev was not made aware that the U.S. suspended security funds until a month after President Trump's call with his counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, which calls into question the whistleblower's account and Democrats' arguments that there was a quid pro quo for the aid.

Whistleblower complaint on Ukraine call declassified and released, alleges Trump solicited foreign 'interference' in election

The whistleblower complaint that touched off a political firestorm in Washington was released to the public Thursday, alleging President Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. The rough transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky was already released a day earlier by the White House. (Click here to read the transcript.) It confirmed that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though it did not show the president explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested in some media reports.

The complaint is not a first-hand account of the call but goes a step further than the transcript. In the complaint, the whistleblower says that White House officials who heard the call were ""deeply disturbed"" by it and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.""

His frustration showed at the end when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated. Maguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information, and it's up to them to decide how to proceed.

Republican governor throws weight behind Trump impeachment inquiry, ex-lawmaker says 35 GOP senators would privately vote to impeach

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott on Thursday became the first Republican governor to back House Democrats' call for an impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Scott said at a news conference that he wasn’t surprised by the allegations that Trump repeatedly urged Ukraine’s president to “look into” Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden because he’s “watched him over the years.” Scott added, however, that he wanted to see more information before taking further action. Other moderate Republican governors have yet to weigh in on an impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake made a bold claim on Thursday at the 2019 Texas Tribune Festival when he said ""at least 35"" GOP senators would privately vote for Trump's impeachment.

""You have another one, Chris Murphy from Connecticut, who insisted the Ukrainian government not investigate Biden,"" he added.

At a press conference in New York on Wednesday, Trump specifically called attention to a little-discussed CNN report from May, which described how Menendez, Durbin and Leahy pushed Ukraine’s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and, by Democrats' current logic, seemingly implied that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake.

TRUMP CALLS AOC, SCHIFF AND NADLER 'DEMOCRAT SAVAGES' AS IMPEACHMENT CALLS INTENSIFY

Democrats in the House and on the 2020 campaign trail largely have backed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s formal launch of an impeachment inquiry this week after details of President Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were made public.

The transcript of that call, which was released after the surfacing of a whistleblower complaint, shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Specifically, Trump asked Zelensky about Biden’s role in securing the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating an energy firm to which Hunter had ties.

But an impeachment push faces a tough climb, particularly in the Republican-dominated Senate, where a two-thirds majority vote is needed to convict the president.

O’Rourke, however, said that he believed that Senate would convict Trump, and said it would be better if the president stepped down instead. He repeatedly mentioned Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 before being impeached due to the Watergate scandal.

“Those closest to Donald Trump, many of whom are alarmed by his behavior and his lawlessness and the crimes that he's committed, need to sit down...and help him to make that same decision,"" O'Rourke said. ""Republican senators today in 2019, much as they did with Richard Nixon need to sit down with the president and make clear to him that there is no way out of this without a trial in the Senate, a trial which I believe will convict the president of these crimes.""

O’Rouke’s calls are unlikely to be heeded by the White House. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Sky News Friday that he would like to testify to Congress and has said that everything he did was “perfectly legal.”

Trump, meanwhile, has defended himself vigorously and has gone on the attack against his Democratic opponents. On Saturday, he accused prominent members of the opposition party of acting like “savages.”"

Democrats--citing a newly released whistleblower complaint-- claim that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid from Kiev unless it agreed to investigate his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealing in the country.

Both Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied that there was an unspoken quid pro quo. Trump insisted that the call was ""perfect"" and he was just doing his due diligence to make sure the country was working to weed out corruption.

Conway addressed reporters outside the White House on Friday and accused Pelosi of taking the inquiry plunge-- not because of new evidence-- but because she was taking orders from men around her. Conway said a move like that is the worst thing a ""woman in power can do.""

According to a Washington Examiner timeline, Pelosi attended an Atlantic festival on Tuesday and was asked about impeachment and she reportedly remained noncommittal. She had a scheduled meeting with Democrats later that day and announced the formal impeachment inquiry, citing Trump's admission that he mentioned the Bidens to Zelensky.

“The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of his national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” she said on Tuesday while announcing the inquiry.

The Associated Press reported that the new drive was led by a group of moderate Democratic lawmakers from political swing districts, many of them with national security backgrounds and serving in Congress for the first time.

It is no secret that Pelosi has been the source of frustration to her party’s liberal wing that has called for Trump’s impeachment for months. Political observers argued that the speaker was deliberate in her actions in order to protect Democrats in moderate districts and hedge against the possibility that the allegations fizzled.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday told an audience at Seton Hall's law school that he believed ""leftists"" were behind the impeachment push, according to Politico. He said the county is going to go down a ""very long and unproductive"" road.

""Speaker Pelosi was dealing with pressure from her caucus and, when you talk about pressure from the left, there is a highly leftist component to the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure for,” Cuomo said. He said Pelosi is ""a deliberate, responsible person. She’s not a knee-jerk person. And I think she resisted the pressure in her caucus admirably for a long period of time.""

The whistleblower complaint was released on Thursday and Democrats appeared to double down on their push. Pelosi tweeted a portion of the complaint that claims Trump was seeking interference and said ""it doesn't get more serious than this.""

Pelosi told the New Jersey Democratic State Committee‘s convention in Atlantic City Friday night, according to Politico, that ""this is not a cause for any joy that we have to go down this path. It’s a difficult decision to make. But we have that obligation because the actions that were taken undermine the constitution and the oath we take to protect and defend, including the oath that the president takes.”

TRUMP OFFICIAL SAYS LAWYERS HAD UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT MOVED TO SECURE SYSTEM

“Speaker Pelosi was dealing with pressure from her caucus and...there is a heightened leftist component to the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure for,” Cuomo said. “She is a deliberate, responsible person. She is not a knee-jerk person and I think she even resisted the pressure in her caucus admirably for a long period of time.”

Pelosi announced the inquiry this week in the wake of revelations about President Trump’s July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump sought assistance in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. In particular, Trump asked about Biden’s bragging that he secured the firing of the Eastern European country’s top prosecutor who had been investigating a firm to which Hunter had ties.

A whistleblower’s complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting help in the 2020 election, while Democrats have claimed the call is evidence of a quid pro quo, in which Trump requests foreign assistance against a political rival in exchange for the unlocking of withheld military aid. They have also alleged a ""cover-up.""

""They're doing their quote unquote inquiry. I think the Ukraine issue raises a lot of questions and I think it is for an investigative committee, it is fodder they can spend months, one witness after another, one witness after another, on all sort of different tracks,” Cuomo said. “Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere, because even if they vote for impeachment, it goes to the Senate and it wouldn't happen in the Senate.”

""So my guess is that this continues and blends into the presidential campaign. The problem with that is that nothing else is going to get done between now and then,"" he said.

Cuomo’s comments underscore the wariness with which the impeachment push is being seen by some more centrist parts of the Democratic Party -- who fear that the country is not yet with them on the inquiry and that it could backfire in an election year as it eclipses other parts of the Democratic agenda.

The Daily News reported that it was a shift for Cuomo after he said Wednesday that “you’re darn right there should be an inquiry.”

But a spokeswoman for Cuomo told the Daily News that the governor on Thursday was describing the divide before Trump’s Ukraine call was revealed.

“Early calls for impeachment from the far left flank members of the caucus were more aggressive, and Nancy Pelosi was taking a deliberative path which the governor agreed with,” the spokeswoman said. “However, that all changed once the Ukraine revelations came to light.”"

In an article published earlier Thursday, the Times revealed that the whistleblower at the center of a political showdown in Washington is a male CIA officer who had previously been detailed to the White House.

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

The “exclusive details” were revealed in a report based on corroborated accounts of three unnamed sources, not the whistleblower himself. The Times also reported that lawyers for the whistleblower refused to confirm that he worked for the CIA and said that publishing information about him was ""dangerous."" (Fox News has not confirmed The Times' report.)

The whistleblower filed a formal nine-page complaint accusing the White House of covering up a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked the foreign leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

The Times’ identification claims to be the most publicly known information about the whistleblower. The paper’s decision was largely rebuked online, even becoming the number one trending topic with the hashtag #CancelNYT.

TRUMP SLAMS MAINSTREAM MEDIA AS 'SCUM' AND 'ANIMALS' DURING PRIVATE EVENT, CRITICIZES WHISTLEBLOWER: REPORT

Trump reportedly pondered who gave the whistleblower the information and said the person is “close to a spy,” according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by The Los Angeles Times. Some critics of the Gray Lady’s decision feel that the whistleblower's safety could be at risk.

The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Y’all really doxxed the whistleblower? If anything happens to him/her, it’s on you, #CancelNYT,” tweeted one person.

“Our country’s heroes are worth far more than clicks and views. Doxxing the whistleblower endangers the individual’s life, which is especially heinous considering the whistleblower went through proper government channels. The NYT protects Trump sources better than this. #CancelNYT,” wrote Dr. Eugene Gu.

MEDIA 'MOVE THE GOALPOSTS' AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT

A source inside the Times who wasn’t involved in the story defended the paper, telling Fox News that the White House and Justice Department reportedly knew the whistleblower was a CIA officer before the report was published.

“It isn’t as if the Times was providing a road map for the White House to hunt him down,” the insider said.

In addition to canceling subscriptions, others even called for the firing of Times’ executive editor Dean Baquet, who had issued a statement explaining why the Gray Lady chose to publish the information

""Dean Baquet should absolutely lose his job over this. Quickly. The damage to the whistleblower's safety is already done, but @nytimes must condemn this decision to protect future sources & whistleblowers. This cannot be left as an acceptable precedent. #CancelNYT,"" Twitter user @KristinMinkDC wrote.

Baquet responded to the criticism in an article published Thursday night saying the Times decided to publish “limited information” about the whistleblower to give him credibility against Trump’s claims that the unidentified person was a “political hack job.”

“The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding,” Baquet said. “We wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.”

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

Critics online appeared unfazed by those who defended the paper, such as Times contributing writer Wajahat Ali, who called on the public to “reconsider” their decision to cancel their subscriptions.

“It employs fantastic journalists & breaks important stories. It's also under direct assault from Trump & his supporters,” he tweeted. “I write for them but I also publicly disagree w/ some decisions, like today's. Yet, the good far outweighs the bad.”

""Fox & Friends"" co-host Brian Kilmeade said that the call ""is certainly a news story"" and asked Gidley whether he was one of the White House officials described by the whistleblower as ""deeply disturbed"" by the conversation. In a New York Times report late Thursday, the newspaper's chief White House correspondent Peter Baker wrote that aides were ""alarmed"" and that ""led to an extraordinary effort to keep too many more people from learning about it.""

""The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,"" the whistleblower wrote, adding that the White House tried to ""lock down"" the records of the call on a secure, classified system.

""Are you one of the people that is deeply disturbed? Have you talked to others that were disturbed by the tone or content of that conversation?"" Kilmeade asked.

Gidley responded that he has not talked to a single person in the White House that was concerned about the call.

""There is nothing there. ... No one in the White House is concerned about this because the president has done nothing wrong,"" said Gidley, claiming ""so many entities have now ruled [the conversation] was just commonplace.""

TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ACCUSES BIDENS OF CORRUPTION, DEMS OF HYPOCRISY

Gidley said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was the one who brought up corruption on the call, leading the president to ask about Joe Biden's son's business dealings in the country.

Zelensky said earlier this week that he never felt pressured by Trump to investigate the Bidens. Trump insisted that he wanted to make sure the country was weeding out corruption before providing the funds.

Democrats insist that Trump was wrong to bring up a political opponent to a foreign leader, and argue that even if he didn't explicitly make a demand, the innuendo was there. Democrats also took issue with the complaint's claim that Trump employed his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the matter.

An unnamed Ukrainian official, however, has said that Kiev was not made aware that the U.S. had suspended nearly $400 million in aid until a month after Trump's call with Zelensky, calling into question the whistleblower's account and Democrats' arguments that there was a quid pro quo involving the aid and an investigation of Biden.

“Up to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already badly divided country,"" the Hawaii congresswoman said in a press release.

Gabbard said she changed her mind this week.

“However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent,"" she said. ""Future presidents, as well as anyone in positions of power in the government, will conclude that they can abuse their position for personal gain, without fear of accountability or consequences.""

Pelosi, D-Calif., announced an official impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Gabbard's Friday statement aligned her with hundreds of other House Democrats in calling for impeachment but on the day of Pelosi's announcement, she told Fox News that it would be too divisive for the country.

TULSI GABBARD WON'T JOIN FELLOW DEMOCRATS' CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT: IT WOULD BE 'TERRIBLY DIVISIVE'

""I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided. The hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart,"" she said during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends.""

She continued opposing impeachment on Wednesday after Trump released a rough transcript of his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Although the transcript showed no explicit quid pro quo, House Democrats accused Trump of leveraging foreign aid as pressure for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

Gabbard responded by saying: ""I think most people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president that won an election in 2016.""

Her Friday reversal came after Thursday testimony from acting Director of National Intelligence Joeseph Maguire, who defended the administration's decision not to report the whistleblower complaint to the inspector general. And according to Maguire, the report was ""hearsay.""

It's unclear which of Thursday's revelations prompted Gabbard's decision but she warned that the United States could become a ""banana republic"" without impeachment. “If we allow the president to abuse his or her power, then our society will rot from top to bottom. We will turn into a banana republic, where people in positions of power – from the president all the way down to the traffic cop – will feel it's OK to abuse their power with no consequences,"" she said.

She added that Pelosi's inquiry must be ""swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused. It cannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus that will further divide our country and undermine our democracy.”

People assume that the way things are now is the way they've always been. But that's not true.

The CIA, for example, was not always like the CIA you're watching now. When President Harry Truman founded the agency right after the Second World War, he envisioned it as a kind of daily newspaper with a readership of one, the president. And the idea was really simple: the CIA would collect intelligence from a variety of sources, and then they would collate that intelligence and give it to the president. He would use it to make wise and informed foreign policy decisions.

It was a good idea. There are a lot of good ideas. Many of them in D.C. meet the same fate. The bureaucracy quickly metastasizes and overwhelms good intentions. That certainly happened with the CIA. Within a few years, Harry Truman himself regretted creating it. In an op-ed he wrote in 1963, Truman complained that ""the CIA has diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policymaking arm of the government.""

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

Truman was disturbed by that development, understandably. He called for scaling back the CIA's power dramatically. But of course, that never happened. The opposite happened, in fact, over time. The CIA got more powerful.

Today, the agency and other intel agencies like it aren't simply policymaking arms of government. At times, they clearly want to be the government itself. They want to run everything, and they do, for moments.

That's the main lesson, by the way, of Donald Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president. We learned today that the official who filed the so-called whistleblower complaint against the president was a career CIA officer detailed to the White House.

The official did not agree with the president's foreign policy views, so he felt entitled to veto those views and bring the U.S. government to a standstill, which he did. That's really the meat of the story.

We know this because the complaint was released Thursday to the public. You can read it if you want. It tells us nothing we didn't already know from the transcript of the phone call that's been released. Trump talked about a variety of issues with the president of Ukraine, including possible corruption involving Joe Biden and his son.

Trump never mentioned military aid or any kind of quid pro quo. They may not like what Trump said, but it's hard to see how it's a crime. Certainly, it's hard to see it as an impeachable offense. And then all of a sudden, everybody in D.C. nodding sagely in unison thinks it is.

Now, the same people who spent two years writing Russia collusion fanfiction are outraged once again. Or did they ever stop being outraged? Probably not.

In any case, they are telling us that the Trump presidency is really ""The Godfather Part 4.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif: Like any mafia boss, the president didn't need to say, that's a nice country you have, it would be a shame if something happened to it.

Anderson Cooper, CNN host: People see this kind of stuff in movies. You see mob bosses doing it. Is this something that presidents do?

Unidentified female: You're right, we see this from mob bosses. We do not see this from presidents.

Unidentified male: If you gave this to me, I'd say it's a typical transcript of what I'd get that I would have put into evidence in the course of a mob boss trial. I mean, it is right out of Don Corleone.

Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent: People have analogized this kind of conversation to when, you know, a godfather would say, you know, I want you to do something. Everyone knows what is involved here.

Nicolle Wallace, MSNBC host: Donald Trump sought to run U.S. foreign policy the way Tony Soprano ran his crime family, except less elegantly.

You know, part of this is our fault in the media. We set up these just terrible incentives where you don't get on television unless you say extreme and mindless things. What is surprising, though, is how so many of these extreme and mindless statements come from people with long and apparently distinguished careers, debasing themselves in order to be on television.

Really, the prime example is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He recently went into a kind of trance during the hearing with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and delivered his own prophetic version of what he believed must have happened between President Trump and the president of Ukraine.

Schiff: This is the essence of what the president communicates: We've been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though. And I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it.

Keep in mind, that isn't some guy babbling in the men's room at Starbucks. That's the man who chairs the mighty House Intelligence Committee. We trust him with our most sensitive information. And yet he is clearly -- he is demonstrably mentally ill, Adam Schiff is.

His position is that the president should be impeached for asking why Joe Biden's son was paid $600,000.00 a year by a foreign company, and why the prosecutor who investigated that foreign company was fired after a threat from Joe Biden. Asking about that gets you impeached.

Remarkably, for the moment anyway, until they wake up, the rest of Schiff's party appears to agree with him on that. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of course, are thrilled by all of this.

""We are talking about the president using the full power of the United States government in order to pursue and manufacture a politically-motivated investigation against a political opponent,"" AOC said in an interview on CNN. ""I think it's an allegation that, frankly, has united more members of the party on impeachment than any other, and so for that, I think it's an understandable decision that we make.""

If these people whose names you don't know, who were never elected to anything, succeed in taking over the government and running things in real life, we're done. Our democracy won't recover.

Rep. Omar, D-Minn., told supporters: ""The fact is that this president is corrupt -- a corrupt president who violates his oath in office must and will be impeached.

So hope you're following that. They are telling us -- the ""Squad"" is telling us and the rest of the party is obeying them, of course -- they're saying that issues are now irrelevant. Impeachment is all that matters. You may be wondering whatever happened to the Democratic Party? The party you remember, the party of working people? The fabled Big Tent Party? That's gone.

Increasingly, the Democratic Party looks like an alliance between the Women's Studies Department in Oberlin and a group of unscrupulous retired intel officials. The party is both flaky and authoritarian. That's a rotten combination. It's rotten for the Democratic Party itself. It's also bad for the country.

For 230 years, this has been a republic with an elected president -- elected. Over time, it's worked pretty well. But now, without a single vote being held, no referendum on this at all, bureaucrats in Washington have decided to change the system.

They'd like a new form of government where America's real rulers are the unelected bureaucrats in the intel agencies in Washington. They're not kind of hiding this. They've been fighting for it pretty much openly since before Trump's presidency began.

In the summer of 2016, the FBI justified opening the Russia investigation, the one that hamstrung the first half of the Trump administration and sucked all of the oxygen out of the city. They justified that based on, remember, Trump's campaign positions. They didn't like his publicly stated views on Russia, the views that voters, by the way, ratified when they elected Trump.

But the Intel community disagreed with his foreign policy views, so they tried to destroy him. That happened. That's not some defense of Trump. That's an observation of what happened. And then two weeks after he took office, somebody decided to leak the president's phone calls with foreign leaders, the leaders of Australia and Mexico. Imagine that.

Imagine how you have to run the country when you can't even speak confidentially with your counterparts in other countries? How does that help America? It doesn't help America. You may hate Trump, but you should still be against that. That kind of thing has been happening ever since.

Well, that's an administrative coup d'etat. I mean, it's not an overstatement to say that's what it is. A lot is at stake here. If these people whose names you don't know, who were never elected to anything, succeed in taking over the government and running things in real life, we're done. Our democracy won't recover.

President Trump and future presidents will be mere figureheads. They will be beholden to a Praetorian Guard of Intelligence officials in Washington. If they defy the consensus in Washington in any way and on any issue, they'll be sabotaged and hurt. That's what they're trying to do now.

So Washington clearly wants to pretend that the 2016 election never happened. Okay, that's amnesia. But now they want to make sure that no future election will matter. And that's terrifying.

""He has to say to himself I'm killing myself to make this country safe and every time I turn around I get incoming. You know what, shame on the Democrats.""

Pirro, author of ""Radicals, Resistance and Revenge,"" took issue with the whistleblower complaint being based on secondhand information about the president's phone conversation with the Ukrainian president.

""This was a setup, this is hearsay, it is absolutely inadmissible in court,"" she said. ""Who are these other people in the White House who are looking to sink our president?

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

House Democrats are moving full speed ahead with the impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers plan to move quickly with their investigation and could file articles of impeachment before year's end.

It comes after the public release of both the whistleblower's complaint and a transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Trump requested that Ukraine investigate the Biden family.

The whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. Democrats have accused Trump of an implied quid pro quo, using U.S. military aid. The White House has vigorously denied the two matters were linked.

Speaking to Tucker Carlson Thursday, Pirro was asked whether Democrats will be happy with the precedent they are setting for impeachment, which could someday be used against a member of their party.

""They're not even thinking that far in advance because they're so blinded by their hatred of Donald Trump that they can't even see what real criminality is,"" she argued."

Wright, a Democrat, noted that the inspector general for the intelligence community found that the whistleblower showed indications of ""political bias"" and was ""in favor of a rival political candidate."" He said the whistleblower relied on secondhand information about Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine and relied on other sources who also may have political biases.

""Now the American people are being told we're going to impeach the president ... but guess what America, you can't ask any questions of any of these people because they have certain protections,"" Wright said.

He said if the whistleblower, as a former intelligence officer, is being used to ""take out"" the president, then he or she should have to testify in front of Congress.

Pelosi has repeatedly said she needed evidence, facts and bipartisan support. Many in her own party wondered why she was dragging her feet, when the more progressive left faction of the Democratic Party had been pushing for impeachment since Special Counsel Robert Mueller first started his investigation.

So many of us, myself included, were surprised when the speaker this week started a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, accusing him of betraying his oath of office and endangering the nation’s security by seeking to enlist a foreign power to tarnish a rival for his own political gain.

But more so, the timing of this was questioned by many. Why didn't Pelosi wait for the actual transcript of Trump’s call with the president of Ukraine to be released? Or for the whistleblower complaint to become public? Or the testimony of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, or the intelligence community's Inspector General Michael Atkinson? Why couldn't she wait a few days?

Shortly after Pelosi’s announcement, in addition to the typical Twitter attacks by the president and his usual claims of a ""witch hunt,"" there were also attacks on Pelosi. The attacks came not only from rank-and-file Republicans, but specifically from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who strongly criticized the speaker's decision to launch an impeachment inquiry.

JESSICA TARLOV: TRUMP IS ABUSING HIS POWER FOR PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAIN

""What I'm concerned [about] now is the speaker of the House changed the course of that office for the history of this country,"" McCarthy said. ""That a body that brings legislation, a body that represents the rule of law, would change the course of what it actually means. To claim that a president had violated a law with no information, based it on a whistleblower she does not know that wasn't even on a phone call, to claim that the president did a quid pro quo and mentioned Biden's name eight times, but when this transcript comes out I want — is it out?”

""So I think at the end of the day the speaker owes an apology to this nation, and I think it's even a question why she should stay in her job,"" McCarthy added.

Now that more information has come out, such as the whistleblower complaint, nearly all House Democrats favor at least an impeachment inquiry, with some going farther and saying Trump should be impeached.

A number of Republicans in the Senate are keeping themselves at more than an arm's length from Trump, and we are seeing evidence indicating that some could vote in favor of impeachment. So is Pelosi about to gain what she sought by announcing an impeachment inquiry?

The president's words and actions in recent days haven't helped his case. He keeps unleashing furious outbursts over the whistleblower revelations.

McCarthy might believe Pelosi jumped the gun, was out of line or just plain wrong, but there are many who back the speaker's decision – and not all of those supporters are Democrats.

Nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials have signed a letter backing the impeachment inquiry. In the letter, published Friday, the officials write that Trump's urging Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden constitutes a “profound national security concern” for the United States.

""To be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress’ deliberative process,"" the letter states. ""At the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings.""

""President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes,"" they write, ""That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power. It also would represent an effort to subordinate America’s national interests — and those of our closest allies and partners — to the president’s personal political interest.""

The letter was signed by many former Obama administration officials as well as some who served in the Bush administration, including Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.

So maybe Pelosi was right?

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

After all, the whispers on the Hill that Pelosi was going to act led not only to the president calling her twice in the hours before the announcement, but also to his own announcement that he would release the transcript of his call to Ukraine's president, which Maguire had previously refused to give Congress.

Could this be the smoking gun Pelosi was waiting for?

The president's words and actions in recent days haven't helped his case. He keeps unleashing furious outbursts over the whistleblower revelations. Pelosi and others have voiced concern over some of Trump's comments comparing the whistleblower to a spy, which some interpret as suggesting the person should be executed.

Now that we have heard from both the acting director of national intelligence and the intelligence community's inspector general, we know the whistleblower is credible. We know this wasn't a partisan act, as so many Republicans want us to believe. We know that a handful of individuals approached the whistleblower with their concerns over potential abuse of power from the executive branch.

In just the past few days, public support for moving forward with impeachment has increased, with some polls showing an increase of 7 percent in favor of the inquiry. This addresses another of Pelosi's concerns — the potential divisiveness the process could have on our nation.

The inquiry will deeply delve into whether the whistleblower was right to be concerned about the president's promise to a foreign leader. Time will tell if Pelosi was right to act. One sign will be if she gets bipartisan support should the matter come to a vote in the House — and another will be if voters don't punish Democrats in 2020 for her decision.

At the time of his deployment in 2014, Buttigieg said, the men and women he served with didn’t know he was mayor of South Bend, Ind.

IN CROWDED DEMOCRATIC 2020 FIELD, CANDIDATES ARE MEETING WITH GROUPS WHO HOLD CLOUT

“My roommate didn’t know that I was anything besides an active-duty lieutenant,"" the candidate recalled as his bus made its way to Boone, Iowa during a four-day tour of central and eastern Iowa.

But once his fellow service members found out, he said, ""they would start calling me the honorable lieutenant.""

Five years ago, Buttigieg was among the rank and file of the United States military. Now he’s on a bus in Iowa trying to win over voters and distinguish himself in a crowded field of Democrats running for president.

“I think of a lot of them think it’s funny that someone they know is running for president,” Buttigieg said of those he served with in Afghanistan. “They’ve been encouraging.""

He added: ""I mean a lot of them are more politically conservative than I am, but they are supportive.”

Buttigieg decided to take a page from former Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s playbook by emulating the Arizona senator's famous “Straight Talk Express” bus tours -- in which he traveled with members of the media and opened himself up to questions on any topic.

It was Buttigieg’s first cup of coffee Sunday morning when he began comparing politics to football.

“I think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. ""You’re protecting the quarterback but it’s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you’re in trouble.""

The campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen. Mitt Romney, and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used. President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff.

It wasn’t typical bus seating.

The furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye. The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi for the press to file stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee.

“I like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,” he said.

When he wasn't talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters.

“I looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,"" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas 4 Pete, said after Buttigieg’s meet-and-greet in Dubuque. “I was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.”

“I think he would make a great president, I mean he so’s smart,” Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler said after a campaign rally in Clinton. “He speaks seven languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.”

While the yellow and blue bus rolled through rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Oh, it’s a four-way race,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination.

“I’m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five people say they’ve made up their mind,” he said. “I think the important thing is that people know you, know what you’re about, do they like what they see -- and we’re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.”

As voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in New Hampshire, Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters. The bus may next head for the Granite State."

READ THE COMPLAINT

The official told The New York Times that Zelensky's government was unaware about the aid issue until a month after Trump's July 25 phone call in which he discussed Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

The whistleblower complaint – citing U.S. officials – claimed that officials in Kiev knew that the military aid could be in jeopardy in early August, but the whistleblower admitted to not knowing ""how or when they learned of it.""

Republicans may seize on the apparent timeline inconsistencies and claim that if a quid pro quo was in place for the roughly $391 million in frozen aid, Ukrainian officials would know about it.

Zelensky said earlier this week that he never felt pressured by Trump to investigate the Bidens. Trump insisted that he wanted to make sure the country was weeding out corruption before providing the funds.

Democrats insist that Trump was wrong to bring up a political opponent to a foreign leader, and that even if he didn't explicitly make a demand, the innuendo was there. Democrats also took issue with the complaint's claim that Trump employed his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the matter.

The whistleblower's complaint named Giuliani and claimed diplomats were upset about his role in pushing Kiev to open an investigation into the Bidens.

According to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to ""contain the damage"" from Giuliani's outreach to Ukraine.

But a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News on Thursday, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine — even sending Giuliani a message reading, ""Connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.""

Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, said he was not aware of Giuliani's doings. ""My only knowledge of what Mr. Giuliani does – I have to be honest with you – I get from the TV or the news media. I’m not aware of what he does for the president,"" Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, he said Thursday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has started an official inquiry into whether the House should pursue impeachment proceedings, but Democrats have refused to hold a roll call vote to authorize the effort.

""Impeaching a President means nullifying the results of a presidential election, which is the core act of American democratic legitimacy,"" The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page wrote on Friday. ""If Democrats are going to do this, they have an obligation to stand up and be counted in a way that the public can examine.""

Trump noted that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of alleged abuse.

“Who’s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,” Trump said. “You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

The Los Angeles Times obtained and released a recording of the president’s comments.

The Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository after leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.

The complaint stated that Trump made a “specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike"" -- a request that does not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration on Tuesday. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server.

Additionally, the complaint said Trump ""suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep"" his current prosecutor general, a claim not supported by the transcript.

CBS News reported late Thursday that the whistleblower complaint further inaccurately claimed that a State Department official was on the call with Zelensky.

The memo was not a ""verbatim transcript"" but was based on ""notes and recollections"" of those memorializing the call.

Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said, “Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint.” The president “has nothing to hide.""

The Biden campaign wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News and CNN to voice ""grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,"" according to The Daily Beast, which first reported the existence of the letter.

The memo, drafted by Biden aides Kate Bedingfield and Anita Dunn, continued: ""While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.""

GIULIANI WASN'T WORKING ALONE IN BIDEN UKRAINE PROBE

Should a network choose to book Giuliani, the Biden campaign called for ""an equivalent amount of time"" to be provided ""to a surrogate for the Biden campaign."" The letter noted Giuliani was not a public official, but Trump's lawyer and personal advisor.

Responding to the request, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted: ""Can we request the removal of Democrats on TV that push hoaxes? Wait, but then who would do the interviews?""

Hours earlier, Giuliani made the rounds on several Sunday shows, including ""Fox News Sunday,"" to argue that evidence of Biden's possible corruption has been hiding in plain sight for months.

Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where son Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office.

Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while critics charged that Hunter Biden essentially might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Giuliani, on Sunday, suggested Shokin was the target of an international smear campaign to discredit his work.

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER’S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

In a combative interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, Giuliani presented what he said was an affidavit signed by Shokin that confirmed Hunter Biden was being investigated when Shokin was fired.

""The Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this."" — Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani

""I have an affidavit here that's been online for six months that nobody bothered to read from the gentleman who was fired, Viktor Shokin, the so-called corrupt prosecutor,"" Giuliani said. ""The Biden people say that he wasn't investigating Hunter Biden at the time. He says under oath that he was."" The Shokin affidavit purportedly said the U.S. had pressured him into resigning because he was unwilling to drop the case.

Later, Giuliani added: ""I have another affidavit, this time from another Ukrainian prosecutor who says that the day after Biden strong-armed the president to remove Shokin, they show up in the prosecutor’s office -- lawyers for Hunter Biden show up in the prosecutor’s office and they give an apology for dissemination of false information.""

After anchor George Stephanopoulos expressed skepticism, Giuliani fired back: ""How about if I -- how about if I tell you over the next week four more of these will come out from four other prosecutors? ... No, no, no, George, they won’t be [investigated], because they’ve been online for six months, and the Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this.""

When Stephanopoulos called it ""not true"" that Hunter Biden had taken more than $1 billion from China while the U.S. was negotiating with the country, Giuliani again said the former Clinton administration official was being too dismissive.

""There's evidence that they got $1 billion directly from China, specific date, 12 days after they returned from a trip to China,"" Giuliani asserted. ""There's evidence that another $500 million went in, and there are three partners.""

Giuliani went on: ""Can I -- can I make a contrast? Can I just make a slight contrast with the so-called whistleblower? The whistleblower says I don’t have any direct knowledge, I just heard things. Up until two weeks before he did that, that wouldn't even [have] been a complaint, would have been dismissed.""

That was a reference to an explosive report in The Federalist showing that the intelligence community recently changed its form for reporting improper conduct. Earlier this year, the intelligence community's form for whistleblowers explicitly stated that complaints based on secondhand information were not actionable.

SCHIFF: AGREEMENT REACHED FOR WHISTLEBLOWER TO TESTIFY

But, that admonition was removed sometime afterward -- around the time that an unnamed whistleblower filed a complaint, based on secondhand information, alleging misconduct in the White House. Although there has been no strict legal requirement for whistleblower complaints to contain only firsthand information, the previous intelligence community form made it clear that such secondhand complaints would not be investigated as a matter of procedure.

Twitter user Stephen McIntyre originally spotted the change in the whistleblower form.

Trump and top Republicans called for answers over the weekend as to when and why the form was changed -- and whether the change was made specifically to allow the whistleblower's complaint to proceed.

Before Giuliani's interview, former Trump Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Bossert criticized Trump's communications with Ukraine, but said he did not see any evidence of an impeachable offense. Giuliani said Bossert was wrong to imply that Giuliani had ever alleged Ukraine directly participated in the hacking of Democrats' servers in 2016.

Speaking separately to Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Giuliani brought up the affidavits and called the situation Clintonesque.

“The pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,"" Giuliani said, ""which goes to the very core of, what did Obama know and when did he know it?""

Giuliani referred to a December 2015 New York Times article about Hunter Biden, Burisma and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message.

""The question is,"" Giuliani asked, ""when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say 'Joe, how could you be doing this?'""

Giuliani was not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Joe Biden from Ukrainian officials, and President Trump’s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine this summer was made in spite of several federal agencies supporting the aid, Fox News’ Chris Wallace reported on ""Fox News Sunday.""

In addition to Giuliani, Washington, D.C., lawyers Joe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working ""off the books"" -- not within the Trump administration -- and only the president knows the details of their work.

In a tweet Sunday, Toensing called the report ""false"" and embarrassing."" Wallace, in a statement, responded, ""We stand by our reporting.""

For his part, Giuliani insisted he ""didn't work with anybody to get dirt on Joe Biden,"" again saying that the information ""was handed to me by the Ukrainians.""

Giuliani stated that so far House Democrats have not subpoenaed him to testify about his work with Ukraine, but if they did he would have to run it by Trump first.

""I'm his attorney, there's something called attorney-client privilege,"" he said. ""That has to be considered even if they don't think he should have attorney-client privilege.""

Democrats have focused on the whistleblower's complaint, released last week, which cited information from White House officials who alleged there'd been efforts to secure Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository only after anonymous leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.

Trump suggested during a phone call with Zelensky that Ukraine look into Biden's boast about firing Shokin, after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving CrowdStrike.

The call came not long after Trump had frozen millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. However, the U.S. later released the aid to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians were unaware the money was frozen in the first place until more than a month after Trump's call with Zelensky, The New York Times reported.

Zelensky has said he felt no pressure from Trump during the phone call to do anything.

The whistleblower complaint contained several apparent factual inaccuracies, prompting some Republicans to call for an inquiry into the whistleblowers' sources -- and why they didn't make the complaint themselves.

Rudy Giuliani, one of the key figures at the center of the latest White House scandal, joined the Fox News Rundown this week to talk about it. And he had a lot to say.

On Thursday's podcast, Giuliani sat down with host Dave Anthony to defend the President against allegations he had inappropriately pressured the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Those allegations made in a whistleblower's complaint released earlier this week led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launching an official impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Something the Democrat leader had put off for months despite pressure from many members of her party.

The President's personal attorney vehemently disputed claims the President's phone call with Zelensky included an offer of a 'quid pro quo' or violated any laws. However, he defended Trump's effort to have the Ukrainians look in to the Biden's family and rejected the arguments made some legal experts that this request alone is a federal crime.

Giuliani has made it his mission for months to expose what he calls the 'dishonesty' and 'corruption' of the Biden family. On the Rundown, He laid out a long detailed case against the former Vice President and his son, accusing them of money laundering and using their political influence to get rich. The former federal prosecutor's list of allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden was so long and complex, we couldn't fit it all in to a single segment.

On the Fox News Rundown Extra this week, you will learn more about Giuliani's role in the events that led to this week's controversy. You will also hear his plans to uncover a conspiracy that includes the Democrats, liberal billionaire George Soros and the 2016 election.

The New York City mayor also explains why he thinks the Democrats' effort to impeach the President will backfire and actually help the Republican party in 2020.

There was a lot to unravel. Here is your chance to hear everything Rudy Giuliani had to say."

Except for the part where Trump talked about former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter. That was inappropriate.

But what’s even more inappropriate is the hysterical, hyperbolic, hypocritical, fabricated (I’m talking to you, Katy Tur) impeachment-seeking reaction to the call.

In football terms, President Trump deserved a five-yard penalty flag. What he did was the equivalent of a false start.

HOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Trump was wrong to request that Zelensky work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to find out what happened when then-Vice President Biden successfully pressured an earlier Ukrainian president to fire a prosecutor who was looking into misconduct by a company called Burisma Holdings. Joe Biden’s son Hunter joined the Ukrainian company’s board in 2014, when his father was serving as vice president.

Presidents and candidates should not call on foreign governments to investigate matters that involve their political opponents. Even if the accusation has merit, presidents and candidates inherently make the issue political when they call on other nations to intervene.

Republicans need to wise up. The overreacting Democrats and their media backers are the real threat to civility, norms and fairness.

Justice should be blind. No one’s fingers should be on the scales of justice, especially when the fingers belongs to the president or other powerful elected officials.

But to Trump’s critics – meaning elected Democrats and much of the media – Trump was headhunting, and they want to throw him out of the game via impeachment. They always have.

This is grossly disproportionate and highly hypocritical.

Trump’s critics don’t want to face the fact that Joe Biden – currently a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the Ukrainian president fired a prosecutor Biden didn’t like.

How many times has the video of Biden’s threat been played on CNN or MSNBC?

The former vice president has a Hunter Biden-sized conflict of interest in this matter and his threat of withholding U.S. loan guarantees makes things worse. But Trump’s critics and much of the media don’t care.

To them, it’s OK when Biden does it. It’s not OK if Trump does.

In addition, three Democratic U.S. senators used their positions of power to pressure Ukrainian officials to do their bidding regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of President Trump.

Sens. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Patrick Leahy of Vermont wrote a letter pressuring Ukrainian officials to work with Mueller to investigate Trump.

So here again we have a double standard. Democrats want us to believe it’s OK when Democratic senators call on Ukrainians to investigate their rival, but it’s not OK if Trump does.

When it comes to working with foreign nations to influence an election, former President Barack Obama’s request to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev takes the cake.

Obama, not wanting his national security positions to become a reelection issue, was caught on camera in 2012 asking Medvedev to tell then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that Obama needed “space” on missile defense negotiations until after U.S. presidential election was over.

In other words, Obama was saying: if you, Vladimir, don’t raise this matter during the election, I’ll have more “flexibility” after the election to reach an accommodation.

Too bad Obama said it on camera. If a whistleblower heard him say it, the case against Obama might have been packaged better.

Even by Washington’s typical standards, the Democratic-media hypocrisy toward Trump is over the top. So too is impeachment.

Many Democrats and their echo chamber in the media have wanted to impeach the Trump even before he took office.

At first, several liberal groups sought to change the outcome of the 2016 election in the Electoral College, but the margin of Trump’s victory was too big for them to succeed. More than 60 elected Democrats boycotted his Inauguration.

As offensive and norm-breaking as Trump can be, it is more norm-breaking and offensive to refuse to accept an election result and instead seek to turn all forms of political disagreement into a constitutional crisis in which the Congress tries repeatedly to remove the president from office, negating the results of an election.

Republicans need to wise up. The overreacting Democrats and their media backers are the real threat to civility, norms and fairness.

Impeachment is not a game. It’s the Constitution’s safety valve and it should only be applied in the gravest of threats to our nation and system of government.

Asking a foreign nation to get involved in an American campaign matter is wrong. It was wrong when Trump did it. It was wrong when Obama did it. It was wrong when Biden did it. It was wrong when Hillary Clinton, through the Steele dossier, did it.

But Republicans of all stripes need to recognize the threat to national unity and cohesion does not come from Trump’s request to Zelensky – it comes from the refusal of Democrats to let the American people decide who our president should be.

Schweizer claimed in an interview airing Sunday on ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" that Donald Trump Jr. would be treated much differently if he was engaged in similar business activity to that of Hunter Biden -- the former Delaware senator's 49-year-old son -- while his father held elected office.

Hunter Biden was paid $50,000 a month by Ukranian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings while it was under investigation for corruption. Media scrutiny of the connection intensified after President Trump was accused of committing an impeachable offense by asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden's dealings.

On ""Life, Liberty & Levin,"" Schweizer said there would be outrage in Congress and the media -- as well as from himself -- if Trump Jr. were involved in a similar situation while his father was in the White House.

PETER SCHWEIZER: HUNTER BIDEN 'WAS SELLING ACCESS' TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, WAS INVOLVED WITH 'CROOKED' COMPANY

""Imagine if Don Junior flew over on Air Force One with his dad and inked a $1.5 billion deal, let's say in an area he has no background in like telecommunications,"" he said. ""Washington would be going ballistic, I would be going ballistic and rightfully so.

""It's a completely different circumstance in the way that response is -- and that's what I think so infuriates people. There are certain people that are supposed to be protected. Biden seems to be one of those.""

During the interview, host Mark Levin alluded to Schweizer's 2018 book ""Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,"" which chronicles his own investigation into the Bidens and other top Washington figures.

""And you write about Republicans in your book [too],"" Levin said.

""Absolutely, they don't want to hear any of it,"" Schweizer said of the same figures in Washington who are outraged over the contents of President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

Schweizer added Trump appears to be held to a different standard because he is not beholden to what he called the District of Columbia's standard ""business model.""

""One of the reasons that there was so much animosity towards Trump... is he represents a massive disruption to the business model of Washington, D.C.,"" he said, characterizing practices inside the Beltway as a cycle of enriching oneself and one's friends while serving in office and ""cash[ing] in even further"" when they leave public service.

""If it's not possible to investigate Joe Biden now, then it's never possible to investigate him,"" he told Levin. ""His son flew with him on Air Force Two -- he [the former vice president] was the point person on critically important national security issues with foreign governments.""

Schweizer also criticized the press for giving scant attention to Hunter Biden's business overseas while his father was vice president.

""The media doesn't seem to think this is a big deal,"" he said.

Yuri Lutsenko, the Ukraine ex-prosecutor general, said he told President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani they had not broken any Ukrainian laws to his knowledge. He said he would start a probe only after U.S. officials launched an investigation.

“I said, ‘Let’s put this through prosecutors, not through presidents,’” Lutsenko told The Times. “I told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official.”

Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and son Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine. That July 25 phone call was the focus of a whistleblower complaint that triggered the House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump also has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

In the July call, Zelensky appeared to make an effort to stay in Trump’s good graces, telling him at least twice that he was “absolutely right.” But, after the White House released a rough transcript this week based on officials’ recollections of the call, Zelensky told reporters he didn’t feel pushed, emphasizing that “no one can pressure me.” He also sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son’s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of “many cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.”

Zelensky was elected in a landslide this past April on promises to uproot the country’s endemic corruption and end fighting with Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine’s east.

""If you can prove that somebody else did it, or there's some other explanation for it, then you pursue that vigorously.""

During a July 25 phone call, Trump made reference to the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, which had investigated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's computers during the 2016 campaign, but did not turn over the server to the FBI. Trump indicated that the server could presently be in Ukraine.

Giuliani also defended his role in exploring allegations that Joe Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukraine into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin by threatening to withhold $1 billion that was owed to Ukraine.

“I wasn’t trying to get dirty information on Biden. Biden was in our way,"" Giuliani said.

Giuliani brought with him an affidavit from Shokin which claimed that he was pressured into resigning because he was unwilling to drop a case against energy company Burisma Holdings, where Biden's son Hunter was a board member. The affidavit states that it was pressure from the U.S. -- specifically Biden -- in the form of withholding the billion dollars that led to Shokin leaving office.

Giuliani also raised suspicion about what Biden knew about his son's business dealings while he was vice president, and what Biden's own role was. He claimed that Biden's son received money from China in an effort to buy the favor of the vice president.

“The pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,"" Giuliani said. ""Which goes to the very core of what did Obama know, and when did he know it?""

Giuliani referred to a December 2015 New York Times article about Hunter Biden, Burisma, and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message.

""The question is,"" Giuliani asked, ""when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say ‘Joe, how could you be doing this?’”

Later on, when asked about a report from earlier Sunday morning that Giuliani was working with attorneys Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing on getting information on Biden from Ukraine, the former New York City mayor said he ""didn't work with anybody to get dirt on Joe Biden,"" again saying that the information ""was handed to me by the Ukrainians.""

Azarov, a former Prime Minister under Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, did not specify to which laws he was referring.

Burisma reportedly paid Hunter Biden up to $50,000 to sit on its board at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv, and a second private equity firm founded by the younger Biden received $3.4 million from the same company. Trump and Giuliani have alleged that when Ukrainian prosecutors tried to investigate Burisma Holdings for corruption, then-Vice President Biden pressured the government to fire the head prosecutor.

Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau said Friday it would investigate Burisma Holdings from 2010 to 2012, but Biden did not sign on until 2014. Biden was a director on Burisma’s board from 2014 until at least 2018. Burisma has faced accusations of tax dodging and improperly securing licenses for gas deposits.

On Friday, the head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office said in a radio interview that neither Joe nor Hunter Biden was the subjects of any investigation. Nazar Kholodnitskiy said in the radio interview that the earlier investigation of Burisma was closed for lack of evidence in 2017, but a court in the Ukrainian capital overruled the move the following year. Despite the court's ruling, the case has remained on hold and the investigation has stalled.

He emphasized that there was no mention of Biden or his son in the Burisma case, which was focused broadly to look into alleged abuse of power by officials in Ukraine's Ministry of Ecology.

In addition to Giuliani, Washington, D.C., lawyers Joe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working ""off the books"" -- not within the Trump administration -- and only the president knows the details of their work.

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER’S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

DiGenova and Toensing have been staunch supporters of President Trump, and were close to joining his legal team during Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. That ultimately did not happen due to conflicts, as Toensing had previously represented witnesses who had already spoken to Mueller’s team.

In a tweet on Sunday, Toensing denied that her husband and she were working with Giuliani and called the reporting ""categorically false."" Wallace later responded, ""We stand by our story.""

When asked by the Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo if he was working with other attorneys to get information about Biden, Giuliani denied it.

""No. I didn't work with anybody to try and get dirt on Joe Biden,"" Giuliani said on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" claiming that the information was handed to him rather than sought out.

A whistleblower complaint citing ""multiple U.S. government officials"" accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden in a July 25 phone call. Democrats have claimed Trump used military aid as leverage over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, although Zelensky insisted there was no pressure at all.

Trump claimed that while he did delay aid to Ukraine, it was because he was pushing for European nations such as Germany to provide additional aid to Ukraine, and that he eventually did provide the aid.

Fox News has learned that the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council were “unanimous” in supporting the aid to Ukraine, and that Trump acted alone in withholding the aid over the summer.

Giuliani has gone on record saying that his investigation began as a probe of possible Ukrainian collusion with the Democratic Party in the 2016 election, which led to him looking into Biden as well. In his call with Zelensky, Trump did reference Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm that had worked on an investigation of a hacked Democratic National Committee server. Trump also claimed that the server itself, which the FBI never acquired, may currently be in Ukraine.

The former New York City mayor asserts that Hunter Biden engaged in improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings, and claims that then-Vice President Joe Biden used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma.

Biden has acknowledged this in the past, stating that he threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if they did not fire Shokin. Biden denied wrongdoing, and has not stated that he did this to protect his son, as Shokin had been accused of corruption.

DiGenova and Toensing have called out Biden publicly, accusing him of acting on behalf of his son, and disputing claims that Shokin was corrupt.

INTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING

A memo released by the White House containing the substance of the call showed that the two leaders discussed U.S. aid to Ukraine as well as the Biden investigation. There was no overt link or reference to a quid pro quo, but Democrats claim the pressure was implied.

Speculation that Trump may have sought campaign assistance from a foreign government -- and the allegation that he used military aid as leverage – has increased demand from Democrats that Trump be impeached, where the party had been split on the issue in the past. While figures such as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., have long touted efforts to investigate Trump for the purpose of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been hesitant to support such a move, out of fear that the move would be politically divisive if the American people did not support it.

After news of the whistleblower complaint came out, however, Pelosi called for a formal impeachment inquiry.

Republicans, meanwhile are criticizing the complaint because the whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of the call. Top Republicans have been pushing for the identity the whistleblower’s government sources.

Republicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower's sources in the White House didn't file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower procedures did not protect second-hand complaints until just days before the whistleblower filed the complaint against Trump. (The New York Times reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed The Times' report.)

Graham, who has adamantly defended the president amid the whistleblower’s allegation, said that he had “zero problems” with Trump’s conversation with Zelensky as outlined in the transcript released by the White House.

The phone call – and the subsequent whistleblower complaint – is at the center of the impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday.

Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.

I’m going to steer clear of the pugnacious to-ing and fro-ing. Let’s consider the intriguing legal issue that ignited it.

Judge Napolitano argues that the July 25 conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky contains the makings of a campaign-finance crime. He highlights Trump’s request for Ukraine’s help in investigating then–vice president Joe Biden. In 2016, Biden pressured Kyiv to drop a corruption investigation of Burisma, a natural gas company that paid Biden’s son, Hunter, big bucks to sit on its board.

Biden, of course, is one of the favorites for the Democratic presidential nomination. Napolitano reasons that the information Trump sought from Ukraine would be a form of “opposition research” that could be seen as an in-kind donation to Trump’s reelection campaign, which should be deemed illegal because the law prohibits foreign contributions and attempts to acquire them. (Napolitano also raised the “arguable” possibility of a bribery offense, on the theory that Trump was withholding defense aid as a corrupt quid pro quo to get the Biden information. But he emphasized the foreign contribution issue. That is his stronger argument, and I am focusing on it, given that the Trump-Zelensky transcript does not support a quid pro quo demand; plus bribery, in any event, raises the same “thing of value” proof problems addressed below.)

DiGenova strongly disagrees. Though there wasn’t much time to elaborate, he is clearly relying on the lack of past campaign-law prosecutions on similar facts. DiGenova is also voicing the prudent conservative hostility to campaign-finance laws: Any expansion of criminal liability would necessarily restrict political speech, the core of First Amendment liberty.

“The president of the United States is the whistleblower and this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,” Miller said, during a contentious interview on “Fox News Sunday.”

Miller said that the whistleblower complaint “drips with condemnation, condescension and contempt for the president” and claimed that the intelligence community’s Inspector General had found evidence of political bias in the complaint.

Miller also bucked when host Chris Wallace countered that the IG had found the report “credible and a matter of urgent concern.""

“They’re wrong,” Miller said.

The White House adviser attempted to evade questioning by Wallace on why Trump used his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to get information on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s work in Ukraine, and why the administration delayed sending military aid to the eastern European Nation.

“The president has got the State Department, he’s got the CIA, he’s got the Pentagon he’s got a number of other agencies, why did he use three private lawyers to get information on Biden?” Wallace said. The interview was tense for the outset with Miller evading many of Wallace’s questions, leading the host to eventually call Miller’s responses an “exercise in obfuscation.”

Miller is one of numerous people connected to the Trump administration making the rounds of the Sunday morning talk shows as the White House deals with the mounting scandal surrounding the president’s controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the subsequent whistleblower report.

INTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING

The whistleblower's complaint, with its detail and clear narrative, is likely to accelerate the impeachment process and put more pressure on Trump to rebut its core contentions and on his fellow Republicans to defend him or not. It also provides a road map for Democrats to seek corroborating witnesses and evidence , which will complicate the president’s efforts to characterize the findings as those of a lone partisan out to undermine him.

In response, Trump threatened “the person” who he said gave information to the whistleblower as he spoke at a private event in New York with staff from the U.S. mission to the United Nations.

“Who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,” Trump said in audio posted by The Los Angeles Times. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

Speaking on Sunday also on NBC News’ “Meet The Press,” Schiff said that the president’s behavior was so “egregious” that House lawmakers were forced to open an impeachment inquiry relating to his call with the Ukrainian leader.

“The gravamen of the offense here is the president using the power of his office to coerce a foreign nation into helping his presidential campaign to once again interfere in our election, and at the same time withholding foreign aid that country so desperately needs to fight off who? The Russians,” Schiff said.

He added: “The situation demands that we move forward with the inquiry.”

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump over his July 25 phone call with Zelensky. Democrats have claimed the president threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country.

The probe was prompted by a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

Schiff on Sunday said that while he expects the White House to push back on the House’s attempts to ascertain information regarding the president’s actions, any attempts to thwart the investigation would be viewed as obstruction.

""The president can't have it both ways — he can't both prevent us from getting evidence on these serious underlying crimes, or potential crimes, this serious breach of his oath of office, and at the same time obstruct our investigation,"" he said. “Even as he tries to weaken our ability to get facts on one, he’s going to strengthen the facts on the other.""

Trump had every right to ask Ukraine to cooperate or assist in an official Department of Justice investigation into the origins of the Russia “collusion” hoax. His request was pursuant to an official probe being conducted by U.S. Attorney John Durham and initiated by Attorney General William Barr. In fact, Ukraine is required to comply under a binding treaty with the U.S.

SCHIFF SAYS AGREEMENT IN PLACE FOR WHISTLEBLOWER TO TESTIFY BEFORE COMMITTEE

The Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters obligates Ukraine to provide, upon request by the U.S., assistance “in connection with the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of offenses, and in proceedings related to criminal matters.” This treaty was negotiated by then-president Bill Clinton more than 20 years ago and approved by the U.S. Senate. Among other things, Ukraine agreed to furnish “documents, records, the taking of testimony or statements of persons” relevant to any U.S. investigation.

READ THE PHONE CALL TRANSCRIPT

Unfortunately, Kiev has not always abided by this treaty. Beset by rampant corruption, past Ukrainian administrations have been less than cooperative with the U.S. Indeed, there is significant evidence that Ukraine actively meddled in the 2016 election by providing dirt on the Trump campaign at the behest of a Democratic National Committee subcontractor who wanted to help elect Hillary Clinton. This is detailed in my new book, ""Witch Hunt.""

What is driving the impeachment blather is an overwhelming desire by Democrats and the complicit media to destroy Trump’s presidency, undo the 2016 election, and evict him from office.

With the election of a new Ukrainian president who vowed to end the rampant corruption, President Trump saw an opportunity to reset relations and obtain assistance in the Durham investigation. As pointed out by columnist Marc Thiessen , the DOJ has disclosed that it is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the campaign during the 2016 election.”

Despite media and Democrat misrepresentations of the conversation, the “do us a favor” remark by Trump was a request that Ukraine cooperate in the Durham probe. The president phrased it in a friendly manner to enlist Zelensky’s assistance, even though it is incumbent on Ukraine to do so under the terms of the treaty. It is not at all unusual for the U.S. government or its president to ask for help from a foreign nation in extant investigations conducted by the DOJ.

Trump’s reference to former Vice President Joe Biden and the suspicious activities of his son, Hunter Biden, comes later in the conversation:

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

It is indisputable that Biden is seen and heard on videotape bragging that he engineered the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine. Shokin is on record telling the Washington Post that he was sacked because his investigators were “on his (Hunter Biden’s) tail” in a case of suspected corruption involving $3 million in fees that found their way into the pocket of the VP’s son. Joe Biden has dismissed this as nonsense and the mainstream media have accepted his explanation as gospel. However, documents newly uncovered by The Hill’s John Solomon belie Biden’s claim. These records appear to show that Shokin’s account, not Biden’s, was true.

Joe Biden’s boast about his “quid pro quo” with Ukraine is compelling evidence that he may have used his public office to confer a benefit ($1 billion) in exchange for something of value –shutting down an investigation to help his son. This is where the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act comes into play, as well as other federal felony statutes such as bribery, extortion, and honest services fraud. The Justice Department would be justified in investigating Biden to determine whether he took any official action involving taxpayer money as Vice President to benefit his son.

Once again, President Trump had every right to ask Zelensky to assist the U.S. in any existing or prospective investigation. Biden doesn’t enjoy immunity simply because he is running in the Democratic primary for president. There is no amnesty for a prospective political opponent. Lest we forget, the Obama administration launched an investigation into the nominee of the opposing party during a presidential campaign.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

Nowhere in the Trump-Zelensky telephone call was there a threat (like Biden’s), pressure, condition, or demand by Trump. Impeachment hysteria, if not insanity, has obscured the facts. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said of Trump’s conversation with his counterpart, “What this shows is repeated, concerted, premeditated, criminal conduct.” Columnist Michael Gerson wrote in the Washington Post, “For the first time in American history, the president has pleaded guilty to an impeachable offense.” This is effectively what happened…,” he added.

It is easy to dismiss such obtuse pronouncements as partisan bloviating. In reality, it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the law, international agreements, and federal investigations. The president’s words were neither a crime nor an impeachable offense. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution imposes a duty on the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” If he is aware of potential evidence of lawlessness that resides in the hands of a foreign government, he is duty-bound to ask that such evidence be produced.

What is driving the impeachment blather is an overwhelming desire by Democrats and the complicit media to destroy Trump’s presidency, undo the 2016 election, and evict him from office. Talk of impeaching Trump began before he was ever sworn in or unpacked his luggage at the White House. Every act by the president has been branded “an impeachable offense.”

At first, it was emoluments, then it was the firing of James Comey as FBI director, then it was the Trump-Russia “collusion” hoax, then it was Trump’s alleged remark about Gen. Michael Flynn, then it was obstruction of justice. Stormy Daniels was supposed to bring down Trump, then it was white-nationalism and neo-Nazism, then it was Michael Cohen’s testimony, then it was Trump’s finances. The list extends ad nauseam.

At every turn and with every perceived slight, howls of impeachment have reverberated through the halls of Congress and in liberal newsrooms across America. Trump’s demise is always just around the corner, they insist. Except it isn’t. Not if you consider those pesky things called facts.

And so, here we are again. Trump-Ukraine “collusion” is just the latest incantation in the never-ending “witch hunt.”"

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, defended the administration's decision to place the Ukraine transcript on a secure server, due to the high volume of leaks within the White House.

Trump was criticized for ordering the transcript of his call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to be placed on a separate server, leading congressional Democrats to believe he was attempting to hide something nefarious.

""You know why they put it in the classified server? There was a study... done by the Senate in 2017. [There were] more leaks in the first five months, state security leaks in the first five months of the Trump administration than any other administration,"" Jordan told Jake Tapper, on ""State of the Union"" Sunday.

""They should be putting everything in there, with folks around you who are leaking information... If I'm the Trump administration, I'd be putting every communication in this [server].""

CNN'S CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: DEMOCRATS' HEARING ON UKRAINE CALL DIDN'T 'HAVE THAT MUCH JUICE TO IT'

Tapper pushed back and accused Jordan of trying to stifle the facts, while Jordan said the whistleblower didn't even have first-hand knowledge of the events in question.

""Who are you going to believe? The guy who had firsthand knowledge and who was on the call, President Zelensky... or the guy who didn’t have first-hand knowledge and had a motive against the president?"" Jordan asked.

He also defended Trump's request for Ukraine officials to investigate 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter, claiming nepotism and corruption drove their business dealings with the foreign nation. He also blamed the media for running interference for them.

""[Hunter Biden] got paid $50,000, Jake,"" Jordan said. ""$50,000 a month for several years... [he] gets hired by a company in an industry he has no experience in, and oh, that’s fine and all you folks in the press and Democrats, 'oh, no problem here.' Try taking that message to the American people... When they see the vice president’s son getting paid $50,000 a month in a field and an industry he has no experience in -- I wonder what Hunter Biden did in those board meetings?""

CONWAY ACCUSES PELOSI OF CAPITULATING TO MALE COLLEAGUES ON IMPEACHMENT

On Tuesday, Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump over his July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Democrats have claimed the president threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country.

The probe was prompted by a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

""What happened in that phone conversation, that a president of the United States would withhold military assistance that was paid for by taxpayer money to essentially shake down the leader of another country unless he did him a favor -- it is so clear,"" Pelosi said Saturday.

The president ""did not see it was wrong to do that,"" she later said.

TRUMP SLAMS DEMOCRATS, WHISTLEBLOWER OVER 'WITCH HUNT' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: 'OTHERS ENDED IN ASHES!'

A memorandum of the Trump-Zelensky made public Wednesday shows that while Trump sought an investigation into the Biden family for corruption, the president did not explicitly leverage military aid.

Trump has repeatedly defended his conduct of the call with Zelensky and calls the latest Democratic probe ""another witch hunt.""

""The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called 'Whistleblower' knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong,"" Trump tweeted Saturday.

During a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this week, Zelensky told reporters that ""nobody pushed me"" during the call with Trump.

""This is very bad news for our country,"" Pelosi said. ""If it is as it seems to be, the president engaged in something so far beyond what our founders had in mind.""

The media have been clamoring to remove Trump from office since he was elected. Here’s a great compilation of just a few examples across 35 months.

When the anti-Trump media weren’t promoting impeachment, CNN was pushing what anchor Wolf Blitzer called “questions about the president's mental fitness” and 25th Amendment solutions as another way to oust Trump.

CNN SHAMES GOP SENATORS WHO 'NEED MORE INFO' ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

Now they will do anything they need to support any effort to send Trump into political retirement. That includes either skipping stories that undermine the impeachment effort or censoring massive chunks of text to manipulate the result.

Remember when we had the missing 18-minute gap in the Watergate tapes? Now we have the missing 540 words of the Ukraine transcript. The big difference is the media complained about the first gap and created the second gap all their own, to establish a phony narrative about President Trump asking the Ukrainian president for a favor.

I credit the word tally to The Federalist, which analyzed the transcript against the narrative manufactured by the press. The site pointed out how journalists jumped from the Trump’s initial request in the call “to do us a favor” all the way down to a completely separate section where he wanted to “talk about Biden's son.”

What Trump was actually asking about in the “favor” section was computer hacking and a company named Crowdstrike. The Biden stuff came later.

The press didn’t care. Journalist after journalist flat-out lied about what Trump said. MSNBC, CNN, NPR. It didn’t matter the outlet, they pushed the same narrative.

MSNBC anchor Katy Tur was one of the worst. (Shocker, I know.) She just made up what Trump said and viewers who didn’t check the transcript would have easily been deceived. She claimed Trump asked: “Will you do me a favor and investigate Vice President Biden’s son? Will you do me a favor and get involved in the 2020 election? Vice President Biden is my chief political opponent.”

In fact, Trump said nothing about the election or Biden being his opponent. He commented how “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution,” which is true. (Here’s the video.)

That didn’t stop Blitzer, who explained the situation this way: “In the ... this summary that was released by the White House, the president specifically quoted as saying to the Ukrainian president, ‘I would like you to do us a favor’ and then goes into an investigation into the Bidens and the Democrats.” Blitzer skipped over the same words as the others.

Broadcast news was no different. “CBS Evening News” Chief Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes used a nearly identical synopsis of the call: “Mr. Trump asked the president of Ukraine for a favor, to look into campaign rival Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter.”

And when journalists weren’t making up their own fictional accounts, they were largely ignoring the made-up accounts of Hill Democrats. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., fictionalized the call during the hearing and few in the press even noted it.

Schiff said: “I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it.” Fact-check obsessed reporters didn’t care.

That’s because the media are thrilled. MSNBC host Chris Matthews told “Morning Joe,” ""they've got him!"" That’s their mindset. Not news.

Live by the tweet …

You’ve probably never heard of Cancel Culture, but you’ve seen it happening all around you. Essentially, it’s when the Internet mob and some media outlets gang up on people to try and destroy their lives.

Newer lefty outlets like BuzzFeed have popularized it, but major media outlets do it, too. Which brings us to the Des Moines Register’s attempt to destroy the life of 24-year-old Carson King. The Iowa State football fan and beer drinker held up a sign saying “Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished” during ESPN’s “College GameDay.” He included a link to send him money and, remarkably, people did just that.

He was given so much money that he decided to donate it to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital. Corporate support soon followed — including Anheuser-Busch — and the total topped $1 million.

AXED DES MOINES REGISTER REPORTER BLAMES 'RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGUES' FOR FIRING, SUGGESTS HE'S OPPRESSED

The Register decided to profile King. Reporter Aaron Calvin dug into King’s tweets to find inappropriate comments he made when he was 16. King was remorseful, but that wasn’t good enough for the Register, which included the old tweets in its profile.

King beat them to the punch and held a press conference apologizing. The story came out and many on Twitter were unhappy, to say the least. The Register went into damage control mode. It released a statement explaining the story process and saying “editors decided we would include the information.”

Twitter users soon uncovered that Calvin – the reporter who wrote the story – had his own offensive tweets, including a version of the N-word. The Washington Post described those comments as “troubling posts that mocked same-sex marriage, made light of abuse against women and used a racial slur.”

Readers were furious. Register Executive Editor Carol Hunter wrote another piece headlined: “We hear you. You’re angry. Here’s what we are doing about it.” She told readers: “We took appropriate action.” Only they didn’t. They blamed the reporter and didn’t apologize for what they did.

According to Calvin, they told him he could quit or be fired and he chose to be fired. Hunter and others at the paper suffered no consequences for their decision to attack King over a few high school comments.

Now Calvin is whining to BuzzFeed, one of the worst advocates of Cancel Culture. According to BuzzFeed: “‘Now that gay marriage is legal,’ he wrote in one 2012 tweet, ‘I’m totally going to marry a horse.’” He also wrote “f---- all cops,” without my polite editing.

But Calvin said he feels “abandoned” by the newspaper, since “the editor knew, the editorial board knew, and the executive editor knew” how he handled the tweets. Naturally, he blamed conservatives for costing him his job, saying “this whole campaign was taken up by right-wing ideologues and largely driven by that force.”

Look for more outlets to lionize Calvin, if only to justify their own similar attempts to destroy conservatives over ancient comments.

King gets to have the last laugh. Much of the world sided with him and his charity efforts have now topped $2 million. And the only person canceled was the one who tried to cancel him.

""I thought it was an interesting point and I think there might be something to it,"" she added while speaking on ""MSNBC Live.""

Her comments came as new polls showed Warren beating both Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the Democratic primary calendar. Sanders and Warren have been portrayed as the standard-bearers for the Democrats' far-left wing.

""What we're seeing of his supporters -- there's a ceiling. There is nowhere to go -- there is no up to go,"" she added.

Starr, a contributor for the channel, said the use of the word would suggest ""poor judgment by the president,"" but despite the misstep, does not at this point constitute a crime.

At the heart of the Democrats’ formal impeachment inquiry is whether or not Trump used the power of his office to pressure a foreign country to investigate his top 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Democrats say that even if Trump did not explicitly tell Zelensky that nearly $400 million in military aid rests with his country's willingness to probe the Bidens, the innuendo was there.

The whistleblower complaint, without firsthand knowledge, claimed that Trump mentioned in his phone call with Zelensky that the U.S. has been very good to Ukraine and said he ""wouldn’t say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good.""

Zelensky, despite facing his own pressures back home, denied feeling any pressure from Trump during the call. Trump called their conversation ""perfect.""

Starr, who was on ""Cavuto Live,"" predicted that the impeachment inquiry is doomed to fail given what we know.

""This will not result in a conviction, so why are we on the impeachment train, we should be on the oversight train and quit calling it impeachment,"" he said.

""That is what you call a high-pressure tactic. And of course the Ukranian president got the message.""

Jeffries was less emphatic when asked whether it would be an impeachable offense for the Trump administration to refuse to comply with a subpoena issued to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to turn over documents related to Ukraine.

""How do you impeach a President who has created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, entirely rebuilt our Military into the most powerful it has ever been, Cut Record Taxes & Regulations, fixed the VA & gotten Choice for our Vets (after 45 years), & so much more?"" he asked.

The president specifically attacked the complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower, who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."" Democrats, following the whistleblower's lead, have accused Trump of threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine in a July 25 call unless the Eastern European country's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, agreed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings there.

""The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called 'Whistleblower' knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong,"" said Trump.

A memorandum of the Trump-Zelensky call was made public Wednesday. It shows that while Trump sought an investigation into the Biden family for corruption, the president did not explicitly leverage military aid.

Trump again defended his call on Saturday, saying: ""The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President, who told the Fake News, at the United Nations, that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!""

While meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, Zelensky told reporters that ""nobody pushed me"" during the call with Trump.

SCHIFF SLAMMED FOR CHLAKING UP 'DISTURBING' FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TO 'PARODY'

Trump also attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., accusing him of ""fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up & twisted words into my call with the Ukrainian President to make it look like I did something very wrong. He then boldly read those words to Congress and millions of people, defaming & libeling me.""

The president then repeated his claim that Schiff ""must resign from Congress!""

In a video message earlier Saturday evening, Trump said that Democrats were ""trying to stop me because I am fighting for you!""

""The Democrats want to take away your guns, they want to take away your health care, they want to take away your vote, they want to take away your freedom, they want to take away your judges, they want to take away everything,"" Trump said.

""We can never let this happen. We’re fighting to drain the swamp and that’s exactly what I’m doing, and you see why we have to do it, because our country is at stake like never before,"" he continued.

""It’s all very simple. They’re trying to stop me because I’m fighting for you, and I’ll never let that happen,"" the president concluded.

On Saturday morning, Trump sent a series of tweets using all capital letters, saying: ""Presidential Harassment!"", ""Make America Great Again!"" and ""Keep America Great!""

He also called out several Democrats by name and said they were the ""Do Nothing Democrat Savages.""

""Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like [Jerry] Nadler, [Adam] Schiff, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me,"" Trump said. ""Oh well, maybe next time!""

TRUMP CALLS AOC, SCHIFF AND NADLER 'DEMOCRAT SAVAGES' AS IMPEACHMENT CALLS INTENSIFY

The initial whistleblower complaint was forwarded to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Maguire said the complaint alleged serious wrongdoing by the president but that it was not his role to judge whether the allegations were credible or not.

HOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

On Friday, the Democratic chairs of three House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to Ukraine that they say pertain to the inquiry.

Schiff, Foreign Affairs chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.; and Oversight chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in a letter they would consider the State Department's refusal to comply by Oct. 4 as ""evidence of obstruction.""

“This country is as divided as it's ever been, is being driven further apart every day by this president,” the former Texas congressman said at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. “The single best thing to bring the country together would be Donald Trump's resignation -- much in the same way that President [Richard] Nixon as his high crimes became public...he made a decison -- ultimately in his best interests for his legacy and the consequences he faced -- but also for this country, to ensure we could heal and unify again ”

TRUMP CALLS AOC, SCHIFF AND NADLER 'DEMOCRAT SAVAGES' AS IMPEACHMENT CALLS INTENSIFY

Democrats in the House and on the 2020 campaign trail largely have backed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s formal launch of an impeachment inquiry this week after details of President Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were made public.

The transcript of that call, which was released after the surfacing of a whistleblower complaint, shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Specifically, Trump asked Zelensky about Biden’s role in securing the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating an energy firm to which Hunter had ties.

But an impeachment push faces a tough climb, particularly in the Republican-dominated Senate, where a two-thirds majority vote is needed to convict the president.

O’Rourke, however, said that he believed that Senate would convict Trump, and said it would be better if the president stepped down instead. He repeatedly mentioned Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 before being impeached due to the Watergate scandal.

“Those closest to Donald Trump, many of whom are alarmed by his behavior and his lawlessness and the crimes that he's committed, need to sit down...and help him to make that same decision,"" O'Rourke said. ""Republican senators today in 2019, much as they did with Richard Nixon need to sit down with the president and make clear to him that there is no way out of this without a trial in the Senate, a trial which I believe will convict the president of these crimes.""

O’Rouke’s calls are unlikely to be heeded by the White House. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Sky News Friday that he would like to testify to Congress and has said that everything he did was “perfectly legal.”

Trump, meanwhile, has defended himself vigorously and has gone on the attack against his Democratic opponents. On Saturday, he accused prominent members of the opposition party of acting like “savages.”"

Democrats--citing a newly released whistleblower complaint-- claim that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid from Kiev unless it agreed to investigate his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealing in the country.

Both Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied that there was an unspoken quid pro quo. Trump insisted that the call was ""perfect"" and he was just doing his due diligence to make sure the country was working to weed out corruption.

Conway addressed reporters outside the White House on Friday and accused Pelosi of taking the inquiry plunge-- not because of new evidence-- but because she was taking orders from men around her. Conway said a move like that is the worst thing a ""woman in power can do.""

According to a Washington Examiner timeline, Pelosi attended an Atlantic festival on Tuesday and was asked about impeachment and she reportedly remained noncommittal. She had a scheduled meeting with Democrats later that day and announced the formal impeachment inquiry, citing Trump's admission that he mentioned the Bidens to Zelensky.

SPECIAL ENVOY TO UKRAINE RESIGNS

“The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of his national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” she said on Tuesday while announcing the inquiry.

The Associated Press reported that the new drive was led by a group of moderate Democratic lawmakers from political swing districts, many of them with national security backgrounds and serving in Congress for the first time.

It is no secret that Pelosi has been the source of frustration to her party’s liberal wing that has called for Trump’s impeachment for months. Political observers argued that the speaker was deliberate in her actions in order to protect Democrats in moderate districts and hedge against the possibility that the allegations fizzled.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday told an audience at Seton Hall's law school that he believed ""leftists"" were behind the impeachment push, according to Politico. He said the county is going to go down a ""very long and unproductive"" road.

""Speaker Pelosi was dealing with pressure from her caucus and, when you talk about pressure from the left, there is a highly leftist component to the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure for,” Cuomo said. He said Pelosi is ""a deliberate, responsible person. She’s not a knee-jerk person. And I think she resisted the pressure in her caucus admirably for a long period of time.""

The whistleblower complaint was released on Thursday and Democrats appeared to double down on their push. Pelosi tweeted a portion of the complaint that claims Trump was seeking interference and said ""it doesn't get more serious than this.""

Pelosi told the New Jersey Democratic State Committee‘s convention in Atlantic City Friday night, according to Politico, that ""this is not a cause for any joy that we have to go down this path. It’s a difficult decision to make. But we have that obligation because the actions that were taken undermine the constitution and the oath we take to protect and defend, including the oath that the president takes.”

TRUMP OFFICIAL SAYS LAWYERS HAD UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT MOVED TO SECURE SYSTEM

“Speaker Pelosi was dealing with pressure from her caucus and...there is a heightened leftist component to the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure for,” Cuomo said. “She is a deliberate, responsible person. She is not a knee-jerk person and I think she even resisted the pressure in her caucus admirably for a long period of time.”

Pelosi announced the inquiry this week in the wake of revelations about President Trump’s July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump sought assistance in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. In particular, Trump asked about Biden’s bragging that he secured the firing of the Eastern European country’s top prosecutor who had been investigating a firm to which Hunter had ties.

A whistleblower’s complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting help in the 2020 election, while Democrats have claimed the call is evidence of a quid pro quo, in which Trump requests foreign assistance against a political rival in exchange for the unlocking of withheld military aid. They have also alleged a ""cover-up.""

""They're doing their quote unquote inquiry. I think the Ukraine issue raises a lot of questions and I think it is for an investigative committee, it is fodder they can spend months, one witness after another, one witness after another, on all sort of different tracks,” Cuomo said. “Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere, because even if they vote for impeachment, it goes to the Senate and it wouldn't happen in the Senate.”

""So my guess is that this continues and blends into the presidential campaign. The problem with that is that nothing else is going to get done between now and then,"" he said.

Cuomo’s comments underscore the wariness with which the impeachment push is being seen by some more centrist parts of the Democratic Party -- who fear that the country is not yet with them on the inquiry and that it could backfire in an election year as it eclipses other parts of the Democratic agenda.

The Daily News reported that it was a shift for Cuomo after he said Wednesday that “you’re darn right there should be an inquiry.”

But a spokeswoman for Cuomo told the Daily News that the governor on Thursday was describing the divide before Trump’s Ukraine call was revealed.

“Early calls for impeachment from the far left flank members of the caucus were more aggressive, and Nancy Pelosi was taking a deliberative path which the governor agreed with,” the spokeswoman said. “However, that all changed once the Ukraine revelations came to light.”"

Pelosi has repeatedly said she needed evidence, facts and bipartisan support. Many in her own party wondered why she was dragging her feet, when the more progressive left faction of the Democratic Party had been pushing for impeachment since Special Counsel Robert Mueller first started his investigation.

So many of us, myself included, were surprised when the speaker this week started a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, accusing him of betraying his oath of office and endangering the nation’s security by seeking to enlist a foreign power to tarnish a rival for his own political gain.

But more so, the timing of this was questioned by many. Why didn't Pelosi wait for the actual transcript of Trump’s call with the president of Ukraine to be released? Or for the whistleblower complaint to become public? Or the testimony of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, or the intelligence community's Inspector General Michael Atkinson? Why couldn't she wait a few days?

Shortly after Pelosi’s announcement, in addition to the typical Twitter attacks by the president and his usual claims of a ""witch hunt,"" there were also attacks on Pelosi. The attacks came not only from rank-and-file Republicans, but specifically from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who strongly criticized the speaker's decision to launch an impeachment inquiry.

JESSICA TARLOV: TRUMP IS ABUSING HIS POWER FOR PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAIN

""What I'm concerned [about] now is the speaker of the House changed the course of that office for the history of this country,"" McCarthy said. ""That a body that brings legislation, a body that represents the rule of law, would change the course of what it actually means. To claim that a president had violated a law with no information, based it on a whistleblower she does not know that wasn't even on a phone call, to claim that the president did a quid pro quo and mentioned Biden's name eight times, but when this transcript comes out I want — is it out?”

""So I think at the end of the day the speaker owes an apology to this nation, and I think it's even a question why she should stay in her job,"" McCarthy added.

Now that more information has come out, such as the whistleblower complaint, nearly all House Democrats favor at least an impeachment inquiry, with some going farther and saying Trump should be impeached.

A number of Republicans in the Senate are keeping themselves at more than an arm's length from Trump, and we are seeing evidence indicating that some could vote in favor of impeachment. So is Pelosi about to gain what she sought by announcing an impeachment inquiry?

The president's words and actions in recent days haven't helped his case. He keeps unleashing furious outbursts over the whistleblower revelations.

McCarthy might believe Pelosi jumped the gun, was out of line or just plain wrong, but there are many who back the speaker's decision – and not all of those supporters are Democrats.

Nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials have signed a letter backing the impeachment inquiry. In the letter, published Friday, the officials write that Trump's urging Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden constitutes a “profound national security concern” for the United States.

""To be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress’ deliberative process,"" the letter states. ""At the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings.""

""President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes,"" they write, ""That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power. It also would represent an effort to subordinate America’s national interests — and those of our closest allies and partners — to the president’s personal political interest.""

The letter was signed by many former Obama administration officials as well as some who served in the Bush administration, including Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.

So maybe Pelosi was right?

After all, the whispers on the Hill that Pelosi was going to act led not only to the president calling her twice in the hours before the announcement, but also to his own announcement that he would release the transcript of his call to Ukraine's president, which Maguire had previously refused to give Congress.

Could this be the smoking gun Pelosi was waiting for?

The president's words and actions in recent days haven't helped his case. He keeps unleashing furious outbursts over the whistleblower revelations. Pelosi and others have voiced concern over some of Trump's comments comparing the whistleblower to a spy, which some interpret as suggesting the person should be executed.

Now that we have heard from both the acting director of national intelligence and the intelligence community's inspector general, we know the whistleblower is credible. We know this wasn't a partisan act, as so many Republicans want us to believe. We know that a handful of individuals approached the whistleblower with their concerns over potential abuse of power from the executive branch.

In just the past few days, public support for moving forward with impeachment has increased, with some polls showing an increase of 7 percent in favor of the inquiry. This addresses another of Pelosi's concerns — the potential divisiveness the process could have on our nation.

The inquiry will deeply delve into whether the whistleblower was right to be concerned about the president's promise to a foreign leader. Time will tell if Pelosi was right to act. One sign will be if she gets bipartisan support should the matter come to a vote in the House — and another will be if voters don't punish Democrats in 2020 for her decision.

JASON CHAFFETZ: REP. ADAM SCHIFF HAS PROVEN HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED – SHOULDN'T BE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIR

The assault by a Democratic speaker on a president she abhors was so transparent she indicted him before seeing any evidence, smeared him before hearing any proof, then executed him in the press without any concern for due process.

It all reminds one of Alice in Wonderland, where the Queen corrected the King’s sense of jurisprudence when she insisted “no, no…sentence first – verdict afterword.”

Then, with a straight face, Nancy Pelosi had the gall to look us square in the eye and say this has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with her disdain for President Donald Trump, nothing to do with her inability to control Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her liberal arsonists who are out to torch the system (and the speaker's leadership).

Seriously?

And just when we thought we had seen the final episode of “House of Cards.”

Here’s what we know.

Our president called Ukraine’s president to congratulate him on his party’s parliamentary victory. That’s what leaders do when other leaders have a good day.

There was no quid pro quo, no trading of promised military aid for political help, no pressure or demand that Ukraine act – or else!

During that call, confirmed by release of the transcript of that conversation, the president briefly referenced the dropped investigation of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, over allegations the vice president may have unfairly influenced an investigation there, and further asked for help in learning more about how corruption from abroad threatened America’s electoral system.

There was no quid pro quo, no trading of promised military aid for political help, no pressure or demand that Ukraine act – or else!

The Democrats, even before knowing any of this, said Donald Trump is clearly guilty of the “high crimes and misdemeanors” standard for impeachment contained in Article 1, Section 2, of the United States Constitution.

The president’s crime?

He won the 2016 election.

His offense? He’s doing what he promised, by taking on a system that threatens the middle class, domestic tranquility and national security.

His sin?

Donald Trump has led America to its best economic report card in decades.

At the same time, the president took on China for abusing trade, Venezuela for abusing its people, and “terrorist-central” Iran for bombing Saudi Arabia.

Pelosi and her henchmen didn’t want to hear any of that.

Instead, they promoted a political lynching they were denied when the 674-day Mueller investigation proved no wrongdoing and the Kavanaugh nomination was approved. Choreographed for effect, they went ballistic over an allegation without waiting to see it, read it or vet it, as if facts and evidence were some inconvenience, some technical points to be addressed later.

Here’s the worst part.

If the Democrats’ assault on the president goes unchallenged, there will be more investigations, more political witch hunts, and more impeachments. If you don’t like something, investigate. If you don’t agree with someone, accuse. If all that fails, call for impeachment.

This is rich, coming from a Congress whose approval ratings are at historic lows, from partisans whose electoral futures are in doubt, and from a House speaker so uncertain about her standing among Democrats she’s willing to gamble, risk it all, to take out a president before the people of America weigh in next year wielding their most powerful weapon: the right to vote.

By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.""

GIULIANI WASN'T WORKING ALONE IN BIDEN UKRAINE PROBE

Should a network choose to book Giuliani, the Biden campaign called for ""an equivalent amount of time"" to be provided ""to a surrogate for the Biden campaign."" The letter noted Giuliani was not a public official, but Trump's lawyer and personal advisor.

Responding to the request, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted: ""Can we request the removal of Democrats on TV that push hoaxes? Wait, but then who would do the interviews?""

Hours earlier, Giuliani made the rounds on several Sunday shows, including ""Fox News Sunday,"" to argue that evidence of Biden's possible corruption has been hiding in plain sight for months.

Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where son Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office.

Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while critics charged that Hunter Biden essentially might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Giuliani, on Sunday, suggested Shokin was the target of an international smear campaign to discredit his work.

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER’S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

In a combative interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, Giuliani presented what he said was an affidavit signed by Shokin that confirmed Hunter Biden was being investigated when Shokin was fired.

""The Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this."" — Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani

""I have an affidavit here that's been online for six months that nobody bothered to read from the gentleman who was fired, Viktor Shokin, the so-called corrupt prosecutor,"" Giuliani said. ""The Biden people say that he wasn't investigating Hunter Biden at the time. He says under oath that he was."" The Shokin affidavit purportedly said the U.S. had pressured him into resigning because he was unwilling to drop the case.

Later, Giuliani added: ""I have another affidavit, this time from another Ukrainian prosecutor who says that the day after Biden strong-armed the president to remove Shokin, they show up in the prosecutor’s office -- lawyers for Hunter Biden show up in the prosecutor’s office and they give an apology for dissemination of false information.""

After anchor George Stephanopoulos expressed skepticism, Giuliani fired back: ""How about if I -- how about if I tell you over the next week four more of these will come out from four other prosecutors? ... No, no, no, George, they won’t be [investigated], because they’ve been online for six months, and the Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this.""

When Stephanopoulos called it ""not true"" that Hunter Biden had taken more than $1 billion from China while the U.S. was negotiating with the country, Giuliani again said the former Clinton administration official was being too dismissive.

""There's evidence that they got $1 billion directly from China, specific date, 12 days after they returned from a trip to China,"" Giuliani asserted. ""There's evidence that another $500 million went in, and there are three partners.""

Giuliani went on: ""Can I -- can I make a contrast? Can I just make a slight contrast with the so-called whistleblower? The whistleblower says I don’t have any direct knowledge, I just heard things. Up until two weeks before he did that, that wouldn't even [have] been a complaint, would have been dismissed.""

That was a reference to an explosive report in The Federalist showing that the intelligence community recently changed its form for reporting improper conduct. Earlier this year, the intelligence community's form for whistleblowers explicitly stated that complaints based on secondhand information were not actionable.

SCHIFF: AGREEMENT REACHED FOR WHISTLEBLOWER TO TESTIFY

But, that admonition was removed sometime afterward -- around the time that an unnamed whistleblower filed a complaint, based on secondhand information, alleging misconduct in the White House. Although there has been no strict legal requirement for whistleblower complaints to contain only firsthand information, the previous intelligence community form made it clear that such secondhand complaints would not be investigated as a matter of procedure.

Twitter user Stephen McIntyre originally spotted the change in the whistleblower form.

Trump and top Republicans called for answers over the weekend as to when and why the form was changed -- and whether the change was made specifically to allow the whistleblower's complaint to proceed.

Before Giuliani's interview, former Trump Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Bossert criticized Trump's communications with Ukraine, but said he did not see any evidence of an impeachable offense. Giuliani said Bossert was wrong to imply that Giuliani had ever alleged Ukraine directly participated in the hacking of Democrats' servers in 2016.

Speaking separately to Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Giuliani brought up the affidavits and called the situation Clintonesque.

“The pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,"" Giuliani said, ""which goes to the very core of, what did Obama know and when did he know it?""

Giuliani referred to a December 2015 New York Times article about Hunter Biden, Burisma and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message.

""The question is,"" Giuliani asked, ""when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say 'Joe, how could you be doing this?'""

Giuliani was not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Joe Biden from Ukrainian officials, and President Trump’s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine this summer was made in spite of several federal agencies supporting the aid, Fox News’ Chris Wallace reported on ""Fox News Sunday.""

In addition to Giuliani, Washington, D.C., lawyers Joe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working ""off the books"" -- not within the Trump administration -- and only the president knows the details of their work.

In a tweet Sunday, Toensing called the report ""false"" and embarrassing."" Wallace, in a statement, responded, ""We stand by our reporting.""

For his part, Giuliani insisted he ""didn't work with anybody to get dirt on Joe Biden,"" again saying that the information ""was handed to me by the Ukrainians.""

Giuliani stated that so far House Democrats have not subpoenaed him to testify about his work with Ukraine, but if they did he would have to run it by Trump first.

""I'm his attorney, there's something called attorney-client privilege,"" he said. ""That has to be considered even if they don't think he should have attorney-client privilege.""

Democrats have focused on the whistleblower's complaint, released last week, which cited information from White House officials who alleged there'd been efforts to secure Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository only after anonymous leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.

Trump suggested during a phone call with Zelensky that Ukraine look into Biden's boast about firing Shokin, after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving CrowdStrike.

The call came not long after Trump had frozen millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. However, the U.S. later released the aid to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians were unaware the money was frozen in the first place until more than a month after Trump's call with Zelensky, The New York Times reported.

Zelensky has said he felt no pressure from Trump during the phone call to do anything.

The whistleblower complaint contained several apparent factual inaccuracies, prompting some Republicans to call for an inquiry into the whistleblowers' sources -- and why they didn't make the complaint themselves.

Yuri Lutsenko, the Ukraine ex-prosecutor general, said he told President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani they had not broken any Ukrainian laws to his knowledge. He said he would start a probe only after U.S. officials launched an investigation.

“I said, ‘Let’s put this through prosecutors, not through presidents,’” Lutsenko told The Times. “I told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official.”

Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and son Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine. That July 25 phone call was the focus of a whistleblower complaint that triggered the House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump also has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

In the July call, Zelensky appeared to make an effort to stay in Trump’s good graces, telling him at least twice that he was “absolutely right.” But, after the White House released a rough transcript this week based on officials’ recollections of the call, Zelensky told reporters he didn’t feel pushed, emphasizing that “no one can pressure me.” He also sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son’s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of “many cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.”

Zelensky was elected in a landslide this past April on promises to uproot the country’s endemic corruption and end fighting with Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine’s east.

""If you can prove that somebody else did it, or there's some other explanation for it, then you pursue that vigorously.""

During a July 25 phone call, Trump made reference to the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, which had investigated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's computers during the 2016 campaign, but did not turn over the server to the FBI. Trump indicated that the server could presently be in Ukraine.

Giuliani also defended his role in exploring allegations that Joe Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukraine into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin by threatening to withhold $1 billion that was owed to Ukraine.

“I wasn’t trying to get dirty information on Biden. Biden was in our way,"" Giuliani said.

Giuliani brought with him an affidavit from Shokin which claimed that he was pressured into resigning because he was unwilling to drop a case against energy company Burisma Holdings, where Biden's son Hunter was a board member. The affidavit states that it was pressure from the U.S. -- specifically Biden -- in the form of withholding the billion dollars that led to Shokin leaving office.

Giuliani also raised suspicion about what Biden knew about his son's business dealings while he was vice president, and what Biden's own role was. He claimed that Biden's son received money from China in an effort to buy the favor of the vice president.

“The pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,"" Giuliani said. ""Which goes to the very core of what did Obama know, and when did he know it?""

Azarov, a former Prime Minister under Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, did not specify to which laws he was referring.

Burisma reportedly paid Hunter Biden up to $50,000 to sit on its board at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv, and a second private equity firm founded by the younger Biden received $3.4 million from the same company. Trump and Giuliani have alleged that when Ukrainian prosecutors tried to investigate Burisma Holdings for corruption, then-Vice President Biden pressured the government to fire the head prosecutor.

Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau said Friday it would investigate Burisma Holdings from 2010 to 2012, but Biden did not sign on until 2014. Biden was a director on Burisma’s board from 2014 until at least 2018. Burisma has faced accusations of tax dodging and improperly securing licenses for gas deposits.

On Friday, the head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office said in a radio interview that neither Joe nor Hunter Biden was the subjects of any investigation. Nazar Kholodnitskiy said in the radio interview that the earlier investigation of Burisma was closed for lack of evidence in 2017, but a court in the Ukrainian capital overruled the move the following year. Despite the court's ruling, the case has remained on hold and the investigation has stalled.

He emphasized that there was no mention of Biden or his son in the Burisma case, which was focused broadly to look into alleged abuse of power by officials in Ukraine's Ministry of Ecology.

“I can’t believe how blind our media has become. They are blindly using the prosecutor who corruptly dismissed the cases against Biden’s son and his corrupt company. There was no investigation.

“Bragging Biden admits it,” he continued.” And if you need help on whether he knew about son, plenty to come.”

Giuliani’s tweets are part of a blizzard of statements from Trump's attorney as he defends his role in seeking an investigation of the Biden family's Ukraine dealings. Trump's role in pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" that issue prompted a full-blown impeachment inquiry last week.

Adding to the firestorm, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told the Los Angeles Times that he saw no reason to investigate Biden or his son Hunter. Lutsenko said he told Giuliani that the Bidens had not broken any Ukrainian laws to his knowledge and that he would start a probe only after U.S. officials launched their own investigation.

“I said, ‘Let’s put this through prosecutors, not through presidents,’” Lutsenko told The Times. “I told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official.”

Lutsenko was referring to the highly controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July when Trump sought an investigation into the Bidens.

“I had to tell him how law enforcement functions here,” Lutsenko said, noting that he could not reopen the case just because Trump wanted it.

Lutsenko has reportedly met with Giuliani twice in person. He told the Times that Giuliani was obsessed with potential misconduct by Biden or his son. Lutsenko reportedly told Giuliani that Hunter Biden’s role while his father was the vice president “could be signs of a conflict of interest” but was not illegal.

GIULIANI WAS NOT WORKING ALONE IN BIDEN, UKRAINE PROBE

According to the Times, Giuliani stopped contacting Lutsenko last year, but upon the election of Zelensky, he began contacting him again. Lutsenko was removed from his post in August.

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire prosecutor Viktor Shokin who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings—where his son Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board, making tens of thousands of dollars per month. The former vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion of critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.

“Well, son of a b—h, he got fired,” Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office.

Biden allies maintain he pressured Shokin because of concerns he went easy on corruption. Critics charged that Hunter Biden may have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.

Meanwhile, as Giuliani criticized the media for “using” Lutsenko, the Biden campaign has blasted media outlets for giving Giuliani air time.

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER’S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

DiGenova and Toensing have been staunch supporters of President Trump, and were close to joining his legal team during Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. That ultimately did not happen due to conflicts, as Toensing had previously represented witnesses who had already spoken to Mueller’s team.

In a tweet on Sunday, Toensing denied that her husband and she were working with Giuliani and called the reporting ""categorically false."" Wallace later responded, ""We stand by our story.""

When asked by the Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo if he was working with other attorneys to get information about Biden, Giuliani denied it.

""No. I didn't work with anybody to try and get dirt on Joe Biden,"" Giuliani said on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" claiming that the information was handed to him rather than sought out.

A whistleblower complaint citing ""multiple U.S. government officials"" accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden in a July 25 phone call. Democrats have claimed Trump used military aid as leverage over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, although Zelensky insisted there was no pressure at all.

Trump claimed that while he did delay aid to Ukraine, it was because he was pushing for European nations such as Germany to provide additional aid to Ukraine, and that he eventually did provide the aid.

Fox News has learned that the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council were “unanimous” in supporting the aid to Ukraine, and that Trump acted alone in withholding the aid over the summer.

Giuliani has gone on record saying that his investigation began as a probe of possible Ukrainian collusion with the Democratic Party in the 2016 election, which led to him looking into Biden as well. In his call with Zelensky, Trump did reference Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm that had worked on an investigation of a hacked Democratic National Committee server. Trump also claimed that the server itself, which the FBI never acquired, may currently be in Ukraine.

The former New York City mayor asserts that Hunter Biden engaged in improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings, and claims that then-Vice President Joe Biden used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma.

Biden has acknowledged this in the past, stating that he threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if they did not fire Shokin. Biden denied wrongdoing, and has not stated that he did this to protect his son, as Shokin had been accused of corruption.

DiGenova and Toensing have called out Biden publicly, accusing him of acting on behalf of his son, and disputing claims that Shokin was corrupt.

INTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING

A memo released by the White House containing the substance of the call showed that the two leaders discussed U.S. aid to Ukraine as well as the Biden investigation. There was no overt link or reference to a quid pro quo, but Democrats claim the pressure was implied.

Speculation that Trump may have sought campaign assistance from a foreign government -- and the allegation that he used military aid as leverage – has increased demand from Democrats that Trump be impeached, where the party had been split on the issue in the past. While figures such as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., have long touted efforts to investigate Trump for the purpose of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been hesitant to support such a move, out of fear that the move would be politically divisive if the American people did not support it.

After news of the whistleblower complaint came out, however, Pelosi called for a formal impeachment inquiry.

Republicans, meanwhile are criticizing the complaint because the whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of the call. Top Republicans have been pushing for the identity the whistleblower’s government sources.

Republicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower's sources in the White House didn't file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower procedures did not protect second-hand complaints until just days before the whistleblower filed the complaint against Trump. (The New York Times reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed The Times' report.)

FORMER UKRAINE PRIME MINISTER SAYS COUNTRY MUST INVESTIGATE HUNTER BIDEN

The comments came after former Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov said that authorities must investigate Hunter Biden to establish whether or not his role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company complied with the nation’s laws.

Azarov, who served under Ukraine's former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, did not specify which laws he was referring to. President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have called on current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family dealings with Ukrainian firm Burisma Holdings.

She said: “We could not ignore what the president did. He gave us no choice. So, it wasn’t any change of mind. I always said we will follow the facts where they take us, and when we see them, we will be ready. And, we are ready.”

Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump over a whistleblower's claim he improperly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine.

Pelosi, D-Calif., said Trump told her about the interaction: “He told me it was perfect, there was nothing in the call. But, I know what was in the call. I mean, it was in the public domain. He didn’t even know that it was wrong.”

She added, “It is wrong for a president to say that he wants you -- another head of state -- to create something negative about his possible political opponent to his own advantage, at the expense of our national security, his oath of office to the Constitution and the integrity of our elections.”

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER’S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump also has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

In the July call, Zelensky appeared to make an effort to stay in Trump’s good graces, telling him at least twice that he was “absolutely right.” But, after the White House released a rough transcript this week based on officials’ recollections of the call, Zelensky told reporters he didn’t feel pushed, emphasizing that “no one can pressure me.” He also sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son’s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of “many cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on “60 Minutes” that House lawmakers have reached an agreement with the whistleblower.

He said he “absolutely” expects the whistleblower to testify.

“We have a pretty good road map -- thanks to the courage of this whistleblower. The complaint sets out any number of witnesses, any number of documents that we need to seek.”

He added he was shocked by Trump’s alleged audacity. “After the last two years that we’ve been through, the president well understood that it was illegal to seek foreign assistance in a campaign. And, immediately after [former Special Counsel Robert] Mueller testified, that is exactly what he was back at doing again.”

Trump, in a string of Sunday night tweets, claimed Schiff committed “treason” for reading an exaggerated take of the phone call during a hearing last week. Schiff later described it as “at least, part, in parody.”

“His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,” Trump wrote.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., disagreed with the Democrats’ vision: “When I read the transcript, I see two leaders having admiration, not intimidation.”"

SCHIFF SLAMMED FOR CHALKING UP ‘DISTURBING’ FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TO ‘PARODY’

The comments came after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., came under fire on Thursday for reading his own ""parody"" version of President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky without noting he'd made it all up.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint alleging Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the Biden family.

Appearing on CBS News’ “Face The Nation,” Giuliani said he had acted “at the request of the State Department.”

“I have all of the text messages to prove it,” Giuliani said. “And, I also have a 'thank you' from them from doing a good job.”

The State Department did not comment on Giuliani's claims.

It came after the release last Thursday of a whistleblower complaint at the center of an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

The complaint, which detailed a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, alleged that Kurt Volker, a former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, reached out to Giuliani to “contain the damage” of his dealings with Ukraine.

Giuliani said Volker facilitated a meeting with Andriy Yermak, a top Zelensky aide, in July. After that meeting, Giuliani said he briefed Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, on his conversation with Yermak.

The State Department has confirmed that Volker helped secure a meeting between Giuliani and Yermak but denied that Giuliani was acting “on behalf” of the Trump administration.

Volker resigned as special envoy to Ukraine after the allegations came to light. Congressional Democrats have said they will compel Volker to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry.

Giuliani told “Face The Nation” that Pompeo’s name was never brought up during those conversations, but claimed that the secretary was aware of his outreach to Ukraine.

INTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING

Graham, who has adamantly defended the president amid the whistleblower’s allegation, said that he had “zero problems” with Trump’s conversation with Zelensky as outlined in the transcript released by the White House.

The phone call – and the subsequent whistleblower complaint – is at the center of the impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday.

Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.

While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- millions of dollars of which had been frozen days earlier.

“This whole thing is a sham,” Graham said on Sunday. “Who is this whistleblower? What bias do they have? Why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story? The transcript does not match the complaint.”

I was a much younger fellow then. The prospect becomes less alluring with age, so I have some trepidation stepping in between two old friends, Andrew Napolitano and Joe DiGenova. Through intermediary hosts, the pair — Napolitano a former New Jersey Superior Court jurist and law professor, DiGenova a former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and prominent defense lawyer — brawled last week on Fox News (where I, like they, contribute regularly).

ADAM GOODMAN: PELOSI'S IMPEACH TRUMP PUSH INSULTS OUR CONSTITUTION. WHY NOT LET VOTERS DECIDE ABOUT TRUMP?

I’m going to steer clear of the pugnacious to-ing and fro-ing. Let’s consider the intriguing legal issue that ignited it.

Judge Napolitano argues that the July 25 conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky contains the makings of a campaign-finance crime. He highlights Trump’s request for Ukraine’s help in investigating then–vice president Joe Biden. In 2016, Biden pressured Kyiv to drop a corruption investigation of Burisma, a natural gas company that paid Biden’s son, Hunter, big bucks to sit on its board.

Biden, of course, is one of the favorites for the Democratic presidential nomination. Napolitano reasons that the information Trump sought from Ukraine would be a form of “opposition research” that could be seen as an in-kind donation to Trump’s reelection campaign, which should be deemed illegal because the law prohibits foreign contributions and attempts to acquire them. (Napolitano also raised the “arguable” possibility of a bribery offense, on the theory that Trump was withholding defense aid as a corrupt quid pro quo to get the Biden information. But he emphasized the foreign contribution issue. That is his stronger argument, and I am focusing on it, given that the Trump-Zelensky transcript does not support a quid pro quo demand; plus bribery, in any event, raises the same “thing of value” proof problems addressed below.)

DiGenova strongly disagrees. Though there wasn’t much time to elaborate, he is clearly relying on the lack of past campaign-law prosecutions on similar facts. DiGenova is also voicing the prudent conservative hostility to campaign-finance laws: Any expansion of criminal liability would necessarily restrict political speech, the core of First Amendment liberty.

“The president of the United States is the whistleblower and this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,” Miller said, during a contentious interview on “Fox News Sunday.”

Miller said that the whistleblower complaint “drips with condemnation, condescension and contempt for the president” and claimed that the intelligence community’s Inspector General had found evidence of political bias in the complaint.

Miller also bucked when host Chris Wallace countered that the IG had found the report “credible and a matter of urgent concern.""

“They’re wrong,” Miller said.

The White House adviser attempted to evade questioning by Wallace on why Trump used his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to get information on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s work in Ukraine, and why the administration delayed sending military aid to the eastern European Nation.

“The president has got the State Department, he’s got the CIA, he’s got the Pentagon he’s got a number of other agencies, why did he use three private lawyers to get information on Biden?” Wallace said. The interview was tense for the outset with Miller evading many of Wallace’s questions, leading the host to eventually call Miller’s responses an “exercise in obfuscation.”

ANDREW MCCARTHY: TRUMP COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY FOR TREASON, HOPELESS CHALLENGER BILL WELD FOOLISHLY CLAIMS

Almost certainly, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will become the new frontrunner, and will win the Democratic nomination. And, almost certainly, she will lose.

There is no disputing that Hunter Biden accepted a lucrative job in Ukraine at a time when his father, who was vice president at the time, became the point person for the U.S. in that notoriously corrupt country. That he allowed his son to do so demonstrates extreme bad judgement on the part of Joe Biden. That he pushed the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor reputed to be investigating his son’s employer smells bad.

Most Americans will not read beyond the headlines. What they have learned, courtesy of the newest attacks on President Trump, is that good old Joe Biden, the likeable and loyal Obama sidekick who somehow has not secured the former president’s endorsement, cannot be trusted.

Voters will experience a whiff of déjà vu, remembering that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s clan also profited mightily from her position in the Obama administration. They may recall that, according to The New York Times, ""While the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, Uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation.""

The NYT report added, ""Shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.""

Voters rejected Clinton for many reasons in 2016, but one of the most enduring throughout her run was that people didn’t trust her. On the cusp of the Democratic nomination, a CNN poll found that 68 percent of the country didn’t think she was ""honest and trustworthy."" Despite being awarded innumerable ""Pinocchios"" on the campaign trail, Trump’s score on that front was much better than Hillary's.

Joe Biden is not Hillary, of course. He is more popular, but as he has campaigned, his star has fallen. In two recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics, Warren has grabbed the lead nationally, and in Iowa, Biden’s position has fallen precipitously; he is now clearly in second place. Moreover, a recent Quinnipiac poll shows, Biden's personal favorability rating among registered voters split 45-45 percent, down from last December, when his favorability was 53-33.

Assuming that Warren’s surge continues, and that she becomes the Democratic Party’s nominee, most analysts reckon she will have to pivot to the political middle to win the voters lost to Democrats in 2016. That includes blue-collar workers in crucial states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, who defected to Trump.

Almost certainly, Elizabeth Warren will become the new frontrunner, and will win the Democratic nomination. And, almost certainly, she will lose.

So when Warren promises to ban fracking, voters in gas-rich Pennsylvania, where the Marcellus shale boom has added tens of thousands of jobs, will wonder, is this good for me? When she advocates ""Medicare-for-all,"" United Automobile Workers in Michigan will ask, why do I have to give up my hard-won Cadillac health benefits? When she argues for decriminalizing illegal immigration and vows to give federal benefits to people in the country illegally, Americans will complain — what about us?

Warren is determined to eliminate the Electoral College, so that New York and California will run the country. She wants to break up big farms and also big tech, undermining two of our most productive and competitive industries, legalize marijuana, ban assault weapons and won't say if she is opposed to abortions in the third trimester.

She also wants to punish our most successful entrepreneurs and inventors by confiscating their wealth, which will drive many out of the country. Though she’s eager to take more money out of the hands of our private citizens in order to build up the powerful state, she is determined to slash defense spending.

There are many people who will agree with some of these policies, but the majority of Americans will stumble on issues like open borders or third-trimester abortions. And, as she is asked how we will pay for all her grandiose plans, it will occur to some that their taxes will go up.

Indeed, when pressed by Stephen Colbert on whether she’ll hike middle-class taxes, she danced around the question. It will come up again.

More important, it will become obvious as she campaigns on higher taxes and increased regulations, that Warren will undo the good that has occurred under President Trump. People who have seen the income gap between rich and poor narrow and job opportunities multiply for all workers, will decide they are better off today that they were four years ago, and decide there is risk in turning our entire economy upside down. They will be right.

Meanwhile, Trump supporters will not be moved by the most recent charges. They have become inured to the constant attacks; consequently, the Republican-led Senate will not throw him out of office. Not even close.

Warren will try, but ultimately fail, to shift ground. She is an uncompromising zealot, who totally believes her rants about corporations being corrupt and greedy, and about everything in the United States being rigged. That’s why she claimed to have Native American ancestry; she knew that the lie would help her get a job in this rigged system.

It also provides a road map for Democrats to seek corroborating witnesses and evidence , which will complicate the president’s efforts to characterize the findings as those of a lone partisan out to undermine him.

In response, Trump threatened “the person” who he said gave information to the whistleblower as he spoke at a private event in New York with staff from the U.S. mission to the United Nations.

“Who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,” Trump said in audio posted by The Los Angeles Times. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

Speaking on Sunday also on NBC News’ “Meet The Press,” Schiff said that the president’s behavior was so “egregious” that House lawmakers were forced to open an impeachment inquiry relating to his call with the Ukrainian leader.

“The gravamen of the offense here is the president using the power of his office to coerce a foreign nation into helping his presidential campaign to once again interfere in our election, and at the same time withholding foreign aid that country so desperately needs to fight off who? The Russians,” Schiff said.

He added: “The situation demands that we move forward with the inquiry.”

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump over his July 25 phone call with Zelensky. Democrats have claimed the president threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country.

The probe was prompted by a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.

Schiff on Sunday said that while he expects the White House to push back on the House’s attempts to ascertain information regarding the president’s actions, any attempts to thwart the investigation would be viewed as obstruction.

""The president can't have it both ways — he can't both prevent us from getting evidence on these serious underlying crimes, or potential crimes, this serious breach of his oath of office, and at the same time obstruct our investigation,"" he said. “Even as he tries to weaken our ability to get facts on one, he’s going to strengthen the facts on the other.""

Trump wants to meet whistleblower, wants Schiff questioned for 'fraud and treason'

President Trump on Sunday said he wants to meet the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his July phone call with the Ukrainian president and to have House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned for “fraud and treason.” “Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called ‘Whistleblower,’ represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,” Trump tweeted. “Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress.”

Trump last week released a transcript of the call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, which along with the complaint, detailed how he asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The incident has set off a formal impeachment inquiry from House Democrats. But Schiff opened Thursday’s hearing on Capitol Hill with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire with an exaggerated reading of the phone call, which he later walked back as a “parody.”

Trump on Friday blasted Schiff for the fictional summary and demanded his immediate resignation. Appearing on ABC News’ “This Week,"" Schiff said that precautions have been taken to protect the whistleblower’s identity amid the criticism from Trump and his allies. The whistleblower is reportedly a member of the CIA and according to Schiff, could testify before House lawmakers soon. Click here for more on our top story.

Biden campaign seeks to bar Giuliani from TV news

Joe Biden's presidential campaign requested in a letter on Sunday that major news networks not invite President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani anymore, after Giuliani spent the morning on a series of talk shows aggressively highlighting what he called Biden's apparently corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China. The Biden campaign wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News and CNN to voice ""grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,"" according to the Daily Beast, which first reported the existence of the letter.

Meanwhile, ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace reported that Giuliani was not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Biden from Ukrainian officials, and Trump’s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine this summer was made in spite of several federal agencies supporting the aid. Washington, D.C., lawyers Joe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working ""off the books"" -- not within the Trump administration -- and only the president knows the details of their work.

Toensing denied the allegations in a tweet. Giuliani denied working with other attorneys in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures."" Wallace responded, ""We stand by our story.""

He gave us no choice,"" she said. ""So, it wasn’t any change of mind. I always said we will follow the facts where they take us, and when we see them, we will be ready. And, we are ready.”

They're part of a rapidly-shrinking group following their House peers in holding out. Within 24 hours on Thursday and Friday, Rep. Conor Lamb, who represents a conservative-leaning stretch of Western Pennsylvania, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, came around to backing an impeachment inquiry.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday she was opening impeachment hearings into Trump. The California Democrat said Trump betrayed America's security by seeking to enlist a foreign power, Ukraine, to tarnish a rival for his own political gain when he leaned on the president of that country to investigate business activities by Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Some vulnerable House Democrats are portraying the issue as a matter of semantics. They want to back committee investigations into Trump while shunning the word ""impeachment.""

THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: HOW DOES REMOVING A PRESIDENT WORK?

Democrats recently announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump over a whistleblower's claim he improperly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

In the July call, Zelensky appeared to make an effort to stay in Trump’s good graces, telling him at least twice that he was “absolutely right.” But, after the White House released a rough transcript this week based on officials’ recollections of the call, Zelensky told reporters he didn’t feel pushed, emphasizing that “no one can pressure me.”

He also sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son’s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of “many cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.”

""My fellow Republicans, it is time to risk your careers in favor of your principles. Whether you believe the president deserves impeachment, you know he does not deserve reelection,"" wrote Flake.

""Our country will have more presidents. But principles, well, we get just one crack at those. For those who want to put America first, it is critically important at this moment in the life of our country that we all, here and now, do just that.""

Trump had every right to ask Ukraine to cooperate or assist in an official Department of Justice investigation into the origins of the Russia “collusion” hoax. His request was pursuant to an official probe being conducted by U.S. Attorney John Durham and initiated by Attorney General William Barr. In fact, Ukraine is required to comply under a binding treaty with the U.S.

SCHIFF SAYS AGREEMENT IN PLACE FOR WHISTLEBLOWER TO TESTIFY BEFORE COMMITTEE

The Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters obligates Ukraine to provide, upon request by the U.S., assistance “in connection with the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of offenses, and in proceedings related to criminal matters.” This treaty was negotiated by then-president Bill Clinton more than 20 years ago and approved by the U.S. Senate. Among other things, Ukraine agreed to furnish “documents, records, the taking of testimony or statements of persons” relevant to any U.S. investigation.

READ THE PHONE CALL TRANSCRIPT

Unfortunately, Kiev has not always abided by this treaty. Beset by rampant corruption, past Ukrainian administrations have been less than cooperative with the U.S. Indeed, there is significant evidence that Ukraine actively meddled in the 2016 election by providing dirt on the Trump campaign at the behest of a Democratic National Committee subcontractor who wanted to help elect Hillary Clinton. This is detailed in my new book, ""Witch Hunt.""

What is driving the impeachment blather is an overwhelming desire by Democrats and the complicit media to destroy Trump’s presidency, undo the 2016 election, and evict him from office.

With the election of a new Ukrainian president who vowed to end the rampant corruption, President Trump saw an opportunity to reset relations and obtain assistance in the Durham investigation. As pointed out by columnist Marc Thiessen , the DOJ has disclosed that it is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the campaign during the 2016 election.”

Despite media and Democrat misrepresentations of the conversation, the “do us a favor” remark by Trump was a request that Ukraine cooperate in the Durham probe. The president phrased it in a friendly manner to enlist Zelensky’s assistance, even though it is incumbent on Ukraine to do so under the terms of the treaty. It is not at all unusual for the U.S. government or its president to ask for help from a foreign nation in extant investigations conducted by the DOJ.

Trump’s reference to former Vice President Joe Biden and the suspicious activities of his son, Hunter Biden, comes later in the conversation:

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

It is indisputable that Biden is seen and heard on videotape bragging that he engineered the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine. Shokin is on record telling the Washington Post that he was sacked because his investigators were “on his (Hunter Biden’s) tail” in a case of suspected corruption involving $3 million in fees that found their way into the pocket of the VP’s son. Joe Biden has dismissed this as nonsense and the mainstream media have accepted his explanation as gospel. However, documents newly uncovered by The Hill’s John Solomon belie Biden’s claim. These records appear to show that Shokin’s account, not Biden’s, was true.

Joe Biden’s boast about his “quid pro quo” with Ukraine is compelling evidence that he may have used his public office to confer a benefit ($1 billion) in exchange for something of value –shutting down an investigation to help his son. This is where the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act comes into play, as well as other federal felony statutes such as bribery, extortion, and honest services fraud. The Justice Department would be justified in investigating Biden to determine whether he took any official action involving taxpayer money as Vice President to benefit his son.

Once again, President Trump had every right to ask Zelensky to assist the U.S. in any existing or prospective investigation. Biden doesn’t enjoy immunity simply because he is running in the Democratic primary for president. There is no amnesty for a prospective political opponent. Lest we forget, the Obama administration launched an investigation into the nominee of the opposing party during a presidential campaign.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

Nowhere in the Trump-Zelensky telephone call was there a threat (like Biden’s), pressure, condition, or demand by Trump. Impeachment hysteria, if not insanity, has obscured the facts. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said of Trump’s conversation with his counterpart, “What this shows is repeated, concerted, premeditated, criminal conduct.” Columnist Michael Gerson wrote in the Washington Post, “For the first time in American history, the president has pleaded guilty to an impeachable offense.” This is effectively what happened…,” he added.

It is easy to dismiss such obtuse pronouncements as partisan bloviating. In reality, it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the law, international agreements, and federal investigations. The president’s words were neither a crime nor an impeachable offense. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution imposes a duty on the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” If he is aware of potential evidence of lawlessness that resides in the hands of a foreign government, he is duty-bound to ask that such evidence be produced.

What is driving the impeachment blather is an overwhelming desire by Democrats and the complicit media to destroy Trump’s presidency, undo the 2016 election, and evict him from office. Talk of impeaching Trump began before he was ever sworn in or unpacked his luggage at the White House. Every act by the president has been branded “an impeachable offense.”

At first, it was emoluments, then it was the firing of James Comey as FBI director, then it was the Trump-Russia “collusion” hoax, then it was Trump’s alleged remark about Gen. Michael Flynn, then it was obstruction of justice. Stormy Daniels was supposed to bring down Trump, then it was white-nationalism and neo-Nazism, then it was Michael Cohen’s testimony, then it was Trump’s finances. The list extends ad nauseam.

At every turn and with every perceived slight, howls of impeachment have reverberated through the halls of Congress and in liberal newsrooms across America. Trump’s demise is always just around the corner, they insist. Except it isn’t. Not if you consider those pesky things called facts.

And so, here we are again. Trump-Ukraine “collusion” is just the latest incantation in the never-ending “witch hunt.”"

And I want to urge everybody who's fair to never use the word ""impeachment"" for the current political process, because it has nothing to do with an impeachment.

This is a legislative coup d'etat. It is an effort by the hard left, the news media, and the deep state to destroy the president chosen by the American people. This is a project they've been involved in since election night 2016.

So far, we have had two years of a totally false Russian narrative, which even the editor of The New York Times had to admit failed with the Mueller report because it revealed there was no collusion. In those two years, we had FBI agents who were leaking. We had all sorts of effort by people in the deep state to destroy the president. We had The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the networks doing everything they could to destroy Trump and they failed.

GIULIANI SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE DEMS FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Now they've come back with a new effort based on a new supposed scandal — which will turn out to be as phony as the Russian project was. But this fits the whole attitude of the left because they wake up every morning just certain Trump has done something terrible. They think he must be replaced. We can't wait till the next election, so they just try anything to get rid of him. This is, in constitutional terms, a coup d'etat. It is an effort by one branch of the government to destroy the incumbent president of the United States without any regard for the facts.

Let's look at the current example. One of the questions that must be answered is: When did the intelligence community change the rules for whistleblowers? Up until recently, in order to be a whistleblower, you had to have personal, firsthand knowledge of what you were blowing the whistle about. For some reason, this was changed. Now, was it changed to make it easier to smear Trump? Probably. But the truth is that we don't know who changed it. We don't know why it was changed, but what it produced was somebody who was not in the room, did not hear the phone call, had no personal knowledge, pulling together innuendo, gossip and rumor into a multi-page complaint — much of which is just plain, factually false.

But the minute there was a supposed whistleblower report, the Times, Post, network news channels and Democrats in the House were all horrified to such a degree that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced they were pursuing impeachment. Keep in mind, she did this before she met the whistleblower and before anybody had read the transcript of the phone conversation between the president of Ukraine and the president of the United States.

It turns out when you read the transcript, you have to ask yourself — at least I do as a historian — what's the big deal? We have all sorts of records of Franklin Delano Roosevelt talking with Winston Churchill. We have records of John F. Kennedy talking with heads of state. We have records of Ronald Reagan talking with Gorbachev. Presidents do this and there’s no quid pro quo. In fact, the brand new, reform-oriented, anticorruption former comedian-turned president of Ukraine was in a happy, positive conversational mood and was telling Trump that he actually modeled himself on Trump to help break up the old order.

It's a fascinating moment, but what comes out of it? You get the hysteria at the Times, Post, and ""Meet the Press."" You get the constant chanting of impeach, impeach, impeach — and yet, that's not what was happening. The fact is, it isn’t Trump who brought up Biden to attempt to blackmail the Ukrainians. It was Joe Biden, who in his own speech to the Council on Foreign Relations says he threatened to take $1 billion in loan guarantees unless they fired the prosecutor who was investigating his son’s company.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Now, maybe Biden was not aware that his son was getting $600,000 a year from a company in Ukraine. That strikes me as pretty implausible. I think if one of my daughters had a $600,000 a year job, I'd know it. But you know we've seen Joe have some problems remembering things, so maybe he just forgot that Hunter was involved.

But it's all weird. And it's not Donald Trump, and it's not Donald Trump's tweets. It is a video in which Biden himself says that he threatened them, told them they had six hours to cave and fire the prosecutor. And as he put it, ""Son of a b----, he got fired."" So, it's legitimate to ask, what was that all about?

And by the way, the prosecutor has said very clearly that he was investigating the company that Hunter Biden was involved in, and he was blocked because of that decision. So, then you get into a fight over whether this guy was corrupt or not corrupt? Part of the answer there is to investigate. Can you imagine the Democrats in the House having a hearing in which the Ukrainian prosecutor lays out the case against Hunter Biden? By any reasonable, normal standards, this is madness.

And it doesn’t stop there. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the Intelligence Committee — which is normally considered a serious committee charged with monitoring the intelligence community of the United States as a global power — opened a supposedly serious hearing by reading two paragraphs from Trump that Trump never said. They just straight-out lie. In fact, Schiff himself admitted he wrote them as an ""interpretation"" of how Trump thinks.

Now, I'm only citing all this because no person who has any serious concern about the Constitution should use the word ""impeachment"" to describe what is closer to a Salem witchcraft trial than an orderly process of seeking justice.

An investigation would be fine. The investigation should include looking into when and who changed the rules for whistleblowing — and who were the sources for the whistleblower? How many of them are in fact liberal Democrats buried deep in the federal bureaucracy who hate Trump? Who leaked it to the news media? This whole thing is a political mugging and should not be honored with the term ""impeachment."" I hope that people would just recognize this as a coup d'etat.

It is a deliberate effort by the left, both in the news media and in the Congress, to destroy the sitting president of the United States. It should be dealt with as such and we should be prepared to demand that they have to be open and engaged.

No one should be confused by the current phony, one-sided partisan effort. It’s not in any way an impeachment process. It is a denial of the American Constitution, a repudiation of the American people's choice of president, and an effort to impose on the country what the left wants — whether the rest of us want it or not.

CONWAY ACCUSES PELOSI OF CAPITULATING TO MALE COLLEAGUES ON IMPEACHMENT

On Tuesday, Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump over his July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Democrats have claimed the president threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country.

The probe was prompted by a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower who accused Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

""What happened in that phone conversation, that a president of the United States would withhold military assistance that was paid for by taxpayer money to essentially shake down the leader of another country unless he did him a favor -- it is so clear,"" Pelosi said Saturday.

The president ""did not see it was wrong to do that,"" she later said.

TRUMP SLAMS DEMOCRATS, WHISTLEBLOWER OVER 'WITCH HUNT' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: 'OTHERS ENDED IN ASHES!'

A memorandum of the Trump-Zelensky made public Wednesday shows that while Trump sought an investigation into the Biden family for corruption, the president did not explicitly leverage military aid.

Trump has repeatedly defended his conduct of the call with Zelensky and calls the latest Democratic probe ""another witch hunt.""

""The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called 'Whistleblower' knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong,"" Trump tweeted Saturday.

During a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this week, Zelensky told reporters that ""nobody pushed me"" during the call with Trump.

""This is very bad news for our country,"" Pelosi said. ""If it is as it seems to be, the president engaged in something so far beyond what our founders had in mind.""

The Constitution gives Congress the power to remove a president before his or her term is up if enough lawmakers vote to say the president committed ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" It starts with an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee, hearings are held, and a vote is taken. If a majority of the House agrees to a resolution, called ""articles of impeachment,"" the president is technically ""impeached"" - something that's happened to two presidents, Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998.

But being impeached doesn't mean the president is immediately removed from office. Think of it as an indictment. What happens next is the trial. That takes place in the Senate, presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. The House appoints ""managers"" to make its case, and the president has a legal team to make his.

TRUMP WANTS TO MEET WHISTLEBLOWER, SAYS SCHIFF MAY HAVE COMMITTED ‘FRAUD AND TREASON’

The Senate then votes - and needs a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president from office. There are currently 47 Senate Democrats, so it would take at least 20 Republican votes to remove President Trump from office.

Ok, that's the official process. But what is all this really about?

Well, there's a Maya Angelou quote the Democrats are fond of when talking about President Trump: ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.""

Alright then.

They've been wanting to impeach Trump from practically the moment he was elected. Last Tuesday afternoon, Nancy Pelosi jumped on the bandwagon with a statement quoting Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine to try and bring some constitutional legitimacy. But earlier that day, she let slip the real motivation.

""What's more serious is that he can't win,"" she said.

There you have it. The ""most serious"" thing is stopping Donald Trump from being re-elected. It's not about the Constitution. It's about retribution. They hate Trump, can't believe he won in 2016, and are worried he'll win again in 2020. They lecture us about democracy and the rule of law but they're the ones who want to use non-democratic means to get rid of a democratically-elected president

This Ukraine story is just the latest pretext. First, it was collusion, then obstruction. When none of that worked, they gave up for a few weeks. ""Oh no!"" they thought. We might have to try and beat him in an actual election.

The establishment's Trump hatred is not policy-based; it's class-based. They think he's vulgar. They mock him because he likes McDonald's.

But then, just in the nick of time, a whistleblower came along. And boy, were they excited. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., who's on the impeachment committee, said, ""Frankly, this turned out to be a gift because it is so clear, so blatant and so corrupt.""

""A gift!"" So much for Speaker Nancy Pelosi's B.S. about how sad this all is.

Now, about that whistleblower who gave the Democrats their ""gift."" The New York Times reported last week that he's a CIA bureaucrat. Let me remind you of another anonymous bureaucrat. He made a splash by writing an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times about a year ago.

We know - because they told us - that there's an organized group of unelected officials actively plotting against the elected president they're supposed to serve. We also know that this latest attempt to overturn the 2016 election was put into motion just as the Democrats were giving up on the Mueller report as the basis for impeachment.

According to an independent Justice Department memo, this whistleblower is an anti-Trump partisan. His defenders say trust him because he followed the right process. But that's not true. He followed the right process until his claim was rejected. Then, it leaked to the press.

Read the document he wrote. He comes across as what he is - a pompous, arrogant bureaucrat who's horrified by the idea that a political outsider could barge into his cozy ruling elite. Snooty establishment pearl-clutchers say it's outrageous to disparage this person. That would never have happened under President Obama. Can you imagine?

Well, yes -- if your name is Edward Snowden. When a whistleblower embarrasses Obama, he's vilified. But if he helps them get Trump, he's deified. What utter hypocrites and charlatans these Washington establishment types are!

Any journalist who uncritically accepts the claims of this whistleblower is allowing their contempt for Trump to destroy their judgment

Now, what about the alleged wrongdoing here?

There's no doubt President Trump talked about investigating Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president. The Democrats and the establishment are resting their case on the words: ""I would like you to do us a favor."" You can argue that the president might have been wiser to respond by saying, ""You know what, that's getting into a political matter and we probably shouldn't talk about it.""

But the idea that this call-- and the so-called whistleblower complaint about it-- is evidence that President Trump abused his office for personal gain, called a world leader to ask him to get dirt on his opponent, meddle in our election, and used American military aid as leverage to make him do it is a joke, a complete joke.

It's incredible to me that any serious person could take any of this seriously. And yet we see every Democrat spouting this obvious nonsense and almost every news anchor doing it. We even hear that if it was a secret ballot, at least 30 Republican senators would vote to convict President Trump and remove him from office, unbelievably, in a presidential election year

There is only one explanation for all of this: Class loyalty. Ruling class loyalty

For 50 years, a ruling class of Republicans and Democrats -- permanent officials in the government bureaucracy, big business bosses with their donations and lobbyists -- have run the world in their interests. Their ideology was based on globalism, with two key components--free trade, and open borders.

Globalism made the ruling class richer and working Americans poorer. If you're operating on a global, not just a national, scale, you can get much bigger and make much more money. If you open your borders, you can import as many new workers as you want and pay all of them less so your profit margins are higher

In 2016, America elected a president who stood against all that and has, exactly as he promised, started to turn it around. This is why they're defending Joe Biden so ferociously. Biden is the absolute epitome of the corrupt ruling class.

The ruling class act all outraged about foreign interference in our democracy, through election meddling. That's just not right, they scream. No. The right way to do it is to cut out the middleman-- don't waste time on stupid elections-- just have the foreign countries meddle directly in our government

Foreign governments interfere in our democracy every day in Washington through all the swampy techniques we've shown you over the years: hiring lawyers and lobbyists, funding think tanks, and putting former government officials' -- and current officials' relatives -- directly on their payroll. What total, disgusting hypocrites they are!

Nancy Pelosi took money from lobbyists representing shady companies in Ukraine. Chuck Schumer took money from lobbyists for the Saudi Arabian and Mexican governments. President Obama's former head of cybersecurity now works for Huawei, an arm of the Chinese government. President Trump's former defense secretary, James Mattis, now works for the swampy Cohen Group, which boasts about shipping American defense jobs overseas and selling American manufacturing firms to foreign countries

And of course, Joe Biden. Forget about the Ukraine corruption-- that's nothing. He took over a billion dollars in bribes from the Chinese government, America's number one adversary, in the form of payments to Biden family businesses in exchange for policy favors. #JoeChina

So spare us the sanctimonious bleating about foreign interference. Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, the whole rotten corrupt crew--you've been selling America to the highest foreign bidder for years--and yes, for personal gain.

This is globalism in action. This is what America rejected in 2016. And the ruling class just can't stand it.

There's one more aspect to this on top of the economic devastation that globalism brought to working Americans and so many heartland communities. There's the cultural condescension, especially on the left, with their intolerance and hate and ""woke-mania.""

The ruling class looks down their noses at the very people who are the victims of their ideas. They sneer at their faith, even their food. The establishment's Trump hatred is not policy-based; it's class-based. They think he's vulgar. They mock him because he likes McDonald's.

The policy achievements--most notably the turnarounds on jobs and especially China--mean nothing to them. They just hate this peasants' revolt. That's why so many journalists are going along with this impeachment farce. They're part of the ruling class, too. They're desperate to fit in at Washington dinner parties. They crave approval on media Twitter.

The challenge to globalism, the class prejudice -- that's what the Trump impeachment is about. It is class war. We didn't start it -- the ruling class did. But we sure as hell are going to fight to the end for the populist revolution.

Starr, a contributor for the channel, said the use of the word would suggest ""poor judgment by the president,"" but despite the misstep, does not at this point constitute a crime.

Democrats say that even if Trump did not explicitly tell Zelensky that nearly $400 million in military aid rests with his country's willingness to probe the Bidens, the innuendo was there.

The whistleblower complaint, without firsthand knowledge, claimed that Trump mentioned in his phone call with Zelensky that the U.S. has been very good to Ukraine and said he ""wouldn’t say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good.""

""Well obviously we would welcome a chance to get copies of those recordings,"" Schiff said later in the call after he and the fake ""Parubiy"" go on to discuss more details of the bogus allegations.

The Russian radio hosts, Vladimir ""Vovan"" Kuznetzov and Alexey ""Lexus"" Stolyarov, who have close ties to the Kremlin, told Schiff that the Kremlin had naked photos of Trump and that ""Parubiy"" could provide audio of Sobchak and Buzova discussing the photos. They also told Schiff that former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn had met with another Russian to talk about how to prevent the photos from going public.

Gaetz accused Schiff of hypocrisy for appearing willing to accept information from the Ukranian government as his committee investigates Trump for advocating that Ukraine pursue an investigation that would have likely been politically beneficial to the president's reelection campaign.

This comes as Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee take center stage in the impeachment fight as the committee is set to question intelligence community Inspector General Mike Atkinson on Friday. The committee also reached a deal for testimony from the whistleblower whose complaint set off scrutiny on Trump's call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, shortly before which he put a hold on $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is playing a central role in leading the impeachment inquiry, has vowed to move quickly through this process, identifying individuals the committee wants to hear from.

PELOSI ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: 'NO IDEA HOW LONG THIS WILL TAKE'

“We will move as expeditiously as possible,” Schiff told CNN last week. “But we have to see what witnesses are going to make themselves available and what witnesses are going to require compulsion.”

Over the weekend, Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-MD., subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to Ukraine they said were critical to their probe.

“Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction on the House’s impeachment inquiry,” they wrote.

Schiff has also scheduled closed-door testimony from intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who is slated to appear before the panel on Friday. Atkinson is the intelligence community watchdog who first received the whistleblower complaint and transmitted it to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.

Schiff has also scheduled depositions for several State Department officials later next month.

In their demands to the State Department, Schiff and the committee chairs asked for correspondence and documents dating back to Jan. 20, 2017. The documents relate to revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as any Biden business activity in Ukraine. They also demanded a list of State Department officials who may have been involved in Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as State Department records about former New York City mayor and Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and records relating to U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Further, the chairs notified Pompeo that they have scheduled depositions for State Department officials slated for next month. The depositions are for former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker—who resigned from his post last Friday—Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

All officials, except Kent, were named in the whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.” The whistleblower alleged that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president into investigating the Bidens, and Democrats have claimed this appeared linked to U.S. military aid to Ukraine -- which Trump denies.

Schiff and the chairs warned that “the failure of these department employees to appear for their scheduled depositions shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House’s impeachment inquiry.”

Schiff hinted last week that any stonewalling from the White House would simply “strengthen” their case on obstruction—which was a focus of informal House impeachment investigations prior to the Ukraine controversy.

Despite the rapidly surfacing developments, Republicans are casting the impeachment inquiry as Russia investigation 2.0.

GIULIANI RIPS EX-UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR FOR DOWNPLAYING BIDEN 'BRIBERY' CLAIMS

“The Democrats learned from the Russia hoax that it’s a mistake to wait for the facts to come out if the facts may not be on their side,” a House GOP source told Fox News. “So the whole point now is to gin up a media frenzy and proceed lightning fast to impeachment based mostly on emotion and hysteria.”

Trump tweeted Monday: ""The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress & the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!""

Meanwhile, Schiff has said he plans to subpoena Giuliani.

“We’re going to need evidence from Rudy Giuliani,” Schiff told “60 Minutes.” “And it’s our intention, as soon as first thing next week, to subpoena him for documents. And there may very well come a time where we want to hear from him directly.”

Giuliani played a key role in seeking political dirt on the Bidens from Ukrainian officials. The controversial July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky revealed that the president wanted to get Zelensky on the phone with Giuliani, as well as Attorney General Bill Barr, to discuss a potential investigation.

Barr, who has sought to distance himself from the controversy, has not been subpoenaed, and it is unclear whether the committees will attempt to compel his testimony.

Democrats, though, plan to continue working expeditiously on the inquiry, with some reports indicating they could even be prepared to introduce formal articles of impeachment against Trump later this fall.

Pelosi, D-Calif., though, has said their time table is fluid, and that she has “no idea” how long the inquiry will take.

“It will take as long as the intelligence committee follows the facts and when they are ready,” she said.

Pelosi announced the formal inquiry last week, amid the chaos surrounding Trump's controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president. But prior to announcing the formal impeachment inquiry, House Democrats already were running informal investigations in an effort to impeach the president. The House Judiciary Committee was probing obstruction of justice and alleged misconduct by the president.

The formal impeachment inquiry takes the House Judiciary Committee's investigation and combines it with other Trump-focused probes being run out of the House Committees on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, Oversight and Ways and Means.

But despite new polls showing an increase in support for the formal impeachment inquiry from voters, the president is blasting it as “another witch hunt.”

“The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!” Trump tweeted Monday.

On the roster: Dems try to stay on offense - Thornberry out as Texodus continues - Booker beats his benchmark - Don’t get sideways with this bear



DEMS TRY TO STAY ON OFFENSE

Politico: “House Democrats are plotting an all-out offensive against President Donald Trump as they pursue an impeachment inquiry, announcing plans on Sunday to streamline their messaging operation and aid vulnerable lawmakers as they face potential blowback in their districts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies laid out the strategy during a private conference call Sunday afternoon. The plan reflects a deepening sentiment among Democrats that Trump’s latest scandal involving Ukraine could persuade the public to support impeachment. But it also underscores longstanding concerns that an impeachment push could jeopardize some of the toss-up seats in 2020 that helped the party win the majority last year. … Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads House Democrats’ campaign arm, advised the caucus’ most vulnerable members to gauge support and test their message through polling in their respective districts…”



No recess from impeachment pressure for House Dems - NYT: “Orange County was the epicenter of the 2018 House Democratic takeover, where Republicans lost four seats in what was once the heart of Ronald Reagan conservatism in California. On Saturday night, as three of the victorious Democrats were honored at an annual political dinner, a new battle was on everyone’s minds: How to protect those gains in 2020 by selling voters on the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. At the dinner, Representative Harley Rouda warned Democrats not to ‘sit on our laurels.’ Representative Mike Levin solemnly said ‘the times have found us.’ And Representative Gil Cisneros, who came out for the inquiry only last week, plugged his campaign website twice to ask for donations and noted, ‘The Republicans are coming after me now.’ A tricky balancing act is now underway for House Democrats as they return to their districts for a two-week recess that will double as a crucial time to frame a coast-to-coast debate over impeachment and the nation’s priorities.”



Pergram: Meanwhile, back at the House - Fox News: “The House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees will continue to toil behind the scenes investigating and, eventually, crafting actual articles of impeachment. More on that in a moment. … The subpoenas are part of a two-pronged strategy by Democrats. Get the information to help tailor the articles of impeachment, or convert a refusal to comply into an impeachment article itself. House Democrats say the recess period is important to educate the public about the impeachment process and to gin up support for it.”



McConnell says ‘no choice’ but for Senate to take up impeachment - USA Today: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to put forward articles of impeachment. The Kentucky Republican told CNBC that the obligation to hold a trial is part of Senate rules and it would take a two-thirds vote of the chamber to change that. ‘I would have no choice but to take it up a based on a Senate rule on impeachment,’ McConnell said. … While the Constitution puts the responsibility of holding an impeachment trial in the hands of the Senate, there has been some speculation that McConnell might refuse to hold a trial.”



Biden wants a Giuliani ban - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign contacted top television anchors and networks on Sunday to ‘demand’ that Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, be kept off the air because of what they called his misleading comments about the Biden family and Ukraine. ‘We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,’ a pair of top Biden campaign advisers, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, wrote in the letter. ‘Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,’ the advisers wrote. The note, which was obtained by The New York Times, was sent to executives and top political anchors at ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC, including star interviewers like Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd and Chris Wallace.”



Trump’s scorched earth attacks turn off some on his side - WaPo: “Sunday started with President Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, saying he was ‘deeply disturbed’ by the implications of his call to the Ukrainian president and ended with a GOP congressman, Adam Kinzinger, calling one of Trump’s tweets ‘beyond repugnant.’ While key Republicans have rallied to the president’s defense since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry last week, the bookends to the day underscore the riskiness of a scorched-earth defense strategy that is predicated on an insistence that Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. The president is running the smashmouth playbook he learned from Roy Cohn, his mentor and Joe McCarthy’s hatchet man. It’s worked repeatedly for Trump, from fighting the Justice Department’s investigation of racial discrimination at his family’s rental properties in the 1970s to overcoming Bob Mueller’s investigation the past two years.”



It's 1998 redux, but will the economy play along? - Politico: “The U.S. economy has sailed through a presidential impeachment before. In 1998, as the GOP-controlled House moved to impeach President Bill Clinton, the stock market soared and the economy grew nearly 5 percent. But economists and Wall Street analysts note that conditions are very different now as Democrats push toward a possible impeachment of President Donald Trump. During the Clinton impeachment, the dot com boom was making Americans exuberant about the economy. Today, the economy is slowing, consumer confidence is dipping and corporate America faces a gauntlet of worries including the trade war with China, the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement and slowing growth around the world. And now investors, consumers and corporate executives face the prospect of a Washington consumed for months by impeachment drama and the uncertain reactions of a volatile president with a penchant for lashing out under stress.”

“The claims of justice, both on one side and on the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected…” – James Madison, Federalist No. 43



TIME OUT: ‘JANUARY BELONGS TO KALE’

Atlantic: “January belongs to kale. This annual vegetable cycle shows up in the past decade of Google Trends data, which compiles how frequently Americans trawl the internet for information about certain terms. Since about 2011, when Gwyneth Paltrow taught the world how to make kale chips on the Ellen show, kale has entered into the cultural lexicon as a status symbol for a generation of young adults drawn to conspicuous health-consciousness. … But kale’s cultural ubiquity might not be exactly what it seems. After kale briefly overtook spinach as America’s favorite cooked green in mid-2014, Google’s measure of interest in kale has steadily declined. The green’s digital fortunes are currently back at about where they were in 2011… Search data aren’t the end-all-be-all measurement of popularity, but the more leads you follow, the more you begin to question the narrative of kale’s dominance. In fact, America might never have been that into kale in the first place.”

THORNBERRY OUT AS TEXODUS CONTINUES

Texas Tribune: “U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection in 2020, making him the sixth GOP congressman from Texas to say he's retiring in recent weeks. ‘It has been a great honor for me to represent the people of the 13th District of Texas for the last 25 years,’ he said in a statement. ‘We are reminded, however, that ‘for everything there is a season,’ and I believe that the time has come for a change. Therefore, I will not be a candidate for reelection in the 2020 election.’ Thornberry joins five other Texas Republicans in Congress who are not running for reelection — U.S. Reps. Kenny Marchant, Pete Olson, Mike Conaway, Will Hurd and Bill Flores. But Thornberry's exit is somewhat different from other Republicans' shocking retirements over the summer. The last remaining Texan from the class of 1994 and the dean of the GOP delegation, Thornberry was expected by many to retire soon. He will turn over his post leading the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee in January 2021, thanks to Republican term limits for committee chairmanships.”



BOOKER BEATS HIS BENCHMARK

Fox News: “Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker says he has reached his self-imposed fundraising goal to continue his White House bid. ‘I have some incredible news, friend. Last night at 8:16 p.m., we reached our goal of $1.7 million -- a full day ahead of the deadline we set for ourselves,’ the Democrat from New Jersey wrote in an email to supporters on Monday morning. ‘Thanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I’m staying in this race -- and I’m in it to win,’ Booker said. … Top Booker advisers have warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand and compete with the top-tier Democratic nomination rivals.”



The Bern has lost its glow - Politico: “With just four months until the first-in-the-nation caucuses, [Bernie] Sanders is in trouble. As he delivered his populist gospel to large crowds of camouflage-clad high schoolers, liberal arts college students, and trade union members across Iowa last week, a problematic narrative was hardening around him: His campaign is in disarray and Elizabeth Warren has eclipsed him as the progressive standard-bearer of the primary. He’s sunk to third place nationally, behind Warren and Joe Biden, and some polls of early nomination states show him barely clinging to double digits. He’s shaken up his staffs in Iowa and New Hampshire. He’s lost the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a left-wing group that backed him in 2016, to Warren. … Sanders is still a top-tier candidate, and many voters haven’t made up their minds yet. But time is starting to run short.”



Biden dials back digital ads - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden’s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists.”



Biden looks for Hispanic Caucus to break his way - Politico: “The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has largely stayed out of the presidential primary so far — partly out of respect for Julián Castro, the only Latino in the race and the brother of CHC Chairman Joaquin Castro. But with Julián languishing at the bottom of polls with around 1 percent support, at least a handful of the group’s 38 members are on the verge of announcing their support for Joe Biden, according to sources familiar with the effort. Their impact could provide an adrenaline boost in a Democratic contest where most campaigns are struggling to win over Hispanic voters — a bloc that will play a key role in early-state Nevada and on Super Tuesday. … Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris currently lead the Democratic primary field in CHC endorsements with three apiece.”



Dems head to K Street to fund convention - Politico: “Two top operatives planning the Democratic Party’s 2020 convention in Milwaukee went to K Street last week to pitch lobbyists on their plans for the $70 million event. Against the backdrop of the Democratic primary, it was an awkward pairing — representatives for special interests meeting with top Democrats while the party’s leading presidential candidates reject corporate PAC and lobbyist cash. But Democratic National Committee officials explained during the meeting how corporations can help foot the bill for the convention, regardless of who the nominee is, addressing some lobbyists’ worries that a crusading left-wing nominee like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could try to reject corporate money, embarrassing convention sponsors. The DNC doesn’t plan to return any corporate money that is donated to the convention regardless of the nominee, convention CEO Joe Solmonese told POLITICO.”

DON’T GET SIDEWAYS WITH THIS BEAR

NY Post: “A black bear with a discerning palate was caught on camera munching on grapes in a California vineyard – but only picking out those used for Pinot Noir, according to a report. Video shows the refined mammal stomping around Navarro Vineyards in Philo, Calif., and stopping to pick at the Pinot Noir vines – ignoring the eight other grape varieties grown at the winery. ‘He will go for the premium fruit,’ Aaron Bennett, co-owner of the family business told the Los Angeles Times. The booze-loving beast has been using the vineyard as his personal snack bar for years, but the business only recently caught the fiend in the act on security footage. ‘Navarro’s taste-tester is back to ‘get it when the gettin’ is good,’’ the business posted on Facebook last week, along with security footage of the bear. … The bear may be drawn to the specific grapes because they are grown in a remote part of the vineyard. Or maybe he just has good taste, Bennett said.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Meg Greenfield was a wonderful journalist, editor and writer. Washington, journalism and American politics will sorely miss her mind and pen. I will too. But, above all, I will miss her heart.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on May 24, 1999.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., appeared in a video on Monday with former Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., to push for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal money from funding abortions.

In the video, which was published on The Root to mark the amendment's 43rd anniversary, Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez enthusiastically back the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act (EACH Woman Act), a bill authored by Lee that would repeal Hyde. The bill has racked up 169 co-sponsors since its introduction in March.

The Hyde Amendment was ""an egregious policy rider,"" Pressley said, ""which does not allow Medicaid to include abortion coverage.""

HOUSE REAUTHORIZES HYDE AMDNEMENT, DESPITE PROTESTS FROM 2020 DEMS

Hyde, which bans any federal money from paying for abortion except in cases of rape and incest, was introduced in 1976 by Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde. Democrats and Republicans have voted to keep the amendment in effect through the years, notably this June when the House passed a spending bill to which a Hyde Amendment reauthorization was attached.

Some Democrats and most Republicans disagree with Lee, Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez.

""The Hyde Amendment was historically a great compromise between pro-choicers and pro-lifers,"" conservative commentator Meghan McCain said on ""The View"" in June, soon after Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden reneged on his longtime support for the Hyde Amendment. ""I feel slighted as someone who was open to him being president, and I think that it’s a dangerous lane for him to take to go super far left.""

TRUMP CALLS AOC, SCHIFF AND NADLER 'DEMOCRAT SAVAGES' AS IMPEACHMENT CALLS INTENSIFY

Lee, Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez say the Hyde Amendment particularly harms poor and minority communities.

""I was a staffer in 1977 to the late, great feminist congressman Ron Dellums,"" Lee said in the video for The Root. ""I knew exactly what this would do, and that would be to deny low-income women and women of color access to the full range of reproductive rights, including abortion.""

Later in the video, Ocasio-Cortez said the trio's effort to repeal Hyde was a defense of Roe v. Wade and women's right to abortion.

""Our access to reproductive justice and reproductive freedom should not be income-based,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Repealing Hyde means that low-income women, women who are incarcerated, nonbinary people who need access to an abortion can get it, not because they are wealthy but because they are an American."""

But the findings in a Quinnipiac University national survey released Monday erase a 20-point gap against impeaching the president in the previous Quinnipiac poll seen just a week ago. In the earlier survey, voters opposed impeachment, 57 percent to 37 percen.

GIULIANI SUBPEONED BY HOUSE DEMS FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT PROBE

""Following a week when House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump and more information emerged about the president's actions regarding Ukraine, public opinion about impeachment is showing a shift,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. ""The percentage of voters who think the president should be impeached and removed from office climbed.""

The survey indicates Democrats showing the greatest change from a week earlier, with their support for impeaching Trump surging from 73 percent to 90 percent. Opposition to impeachment among independents dropped from 58 percent a week ago to 50 percent in the new poll, with support from independents jumping from 34 percent to 42 percent. Republicans remain overwhelming opposed to impeachment over the scandal, which has rocked the Trump White House.

A majority of voters – 50 percent to 40 percent - say the president did something wrong during a conversation in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged the Ukrainian leader to probe former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially his made rival in the 2020 election.

Independents, by a 52 percent-41 percent margin, feel the president did something wrong.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE UKRAINIAN CONTROVERSY

""Despite the fact that the impeachment inquiry is just getting underway, half of American voters already believe that President Trump has done something wrong when it comes to his interactions with Ukraine's leader. Of that group, there's a virtually unanimous view he did something seriously wrong,"" Snow said.

Fifty-two percent of voters questioned say that asking a foreign leader for help in defeating an opponent in an upcoming election is a good enough reason to impeach a president and remove him from office, while 38 percent say it is not.

But the poll also indicates a majority believe members of Congress backing impeachment at this point are doing so based on partisan politics rather than on the facts.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Friday-Sunday (Sept. 27-29), with 1,115 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points."

Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., expressed harsh criticism for President Trump related to his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but remained measured in predicting whether or not it will result in Trump's impeachment.

Jeffries, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, blasted the president based on allegations laid out in an anonymous whistleblower complaint that alleged Trump exerted pressure to have Zelensky help investigate Joe Biden.

DOJ LEARNED OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL FROM CIA OFFICIAL, DAYS BEFORE COMPLAINT WAS TURNED OVER

""The president has betrayed his oath of office, he's engaged in serious wrongdoing here. He pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for political gain,"" Jeffries told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""That is classic abuse of power, which undermines our national security. This is as serious as it gets.""

Host Chris Wallace pointed out that Zelensky himself has stated that there was no pressure imposed on him, but Jeffries discounted this, claiming that if Trump asks a favor of the Ukrainian president, it has added weight due to the power of the U.S.

""That is what you call a high-pressure tactic. And of course the Ukranian president got the message.""

Jeffries was less emphatic when asked whether it would be an impeachable offense for the Trump administration to refuse to comply with a subpoena issued to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to turn over documents related to Ukraine.

""We're going to remain focused on the abuse of power that clearly exists,"" Jeffries said. ""There is evidence that is hiding in plain sight of that fact, including the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between the president of the United States of America and the president of Ukraine.""

Jeffries did say, however, that if there is evidence of ""continued obstruction, to the extent that there is a continued cover-up, that could provide potential grounds for an obstruction of Congress charge.""

Ultimately, while Jeffries was adamant about Trump committing wrongdoing, he would not jump to conclusions regarding whether the current investigations being conducted by House Democrats would result in impeachment.

""That remains to be seen because we are in the middle of a process,"" he said."

""He told me it was perfect, that there was nothing on the call,"" Pelosi said on CBS News' ""60 Minutes,"" referring to a conversation she had with President Trump before the Trump administration released either a transcript of his call with Ukraine's leader or the whistleblower's complaint.

""But, I know what was in the call,"" Pelosi continued, before quickly adding, ""I mean, uh, it was in the public domain.""

WHEN AND WHY DID KEY WHISTLEBLOWER FORM CHANGE TO ALLOW INFORMATION FROM SECONDHAND SOURCES?

Pelosi's remark drew scrutiny from Republicans because no verbatim account of Trump's call had yet been made publicly available.

""@SpeakerPelosi⁩ said on 60 Minutes last night she knew the details of the classified Ukraine call before White House released transcript,"" Cheney wrote on Twitter. ""This is starting to seem like a political set up. So, Madame Speaker, 'what did you know and when did you know it?'”

Speaking to Fox News, Pelosi communications director Ashley Etienne said Pelosi was referring only to publicly available information, and that Cheney had misinterpreted the question Pelosi had been asked. Etienne said that to her knowledge, Pelosi was not made aware of the whistleblower complaint or the contents of the transcript before they were publicly released.

On Sept. 9, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was informed by the intelligence community inspector general about a whistleblower complaint that could involve the president. The next day, Schiff sent a letter demanding details of the complaint and accusing intelligence officials of violating the law. But Schiff and top Democrats apparently had not obtained a leaked copy of Trump's remarks on his call with Ukraine's leader, which was one of the main focuses of the complaint.

Cheney's comments came as Republicans on Monday challenged intelligence community officials to explain why a key whistleblower form apparently was changed to drop a requirement for ""firsthand information,"" questioning whether the timing was related to the explosive complaint on Trump’s call with the leader of Ukraine.

In a detail first reported by The Federalist, a key form was revised recently to drop a requirement that such complaints include firsthand information in order to be sent to Congress. Although the firsthand requirement was not found in relevant law, it was seemingly an important procedural hurdle -- whistleblowers were required to certify that they had firsthand information, and were told their complaints would not be processed otherwise.

But, in a lengthy statement Monday, the intelligence community watchdog revealed that the whistleblower had said he or she had firsthand information, as well as secondhand information. The watchdog also said the whistleblower had filled out the older version of the form, which retained the requirement that whistleblowers have firsthand information. It remained unclear what the firsthand information was.

The watchdog wrote: ""In the process of reviewing and clarifying those forms, and in response to recent press inquiries regarding the instant whistleblower complaint, the ICIG understood that certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read – incorrectly – as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess firsthand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees.""

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES EMERGE

That anonymous complaint, which spurred congressional Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry last week, was based primarily on secondhand accounts from ""more than half a dozen U.S. officials.""

The complaint alleged that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family – something the now-public transcript of the call with President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed. And, it included a variety of other disputed allegations, including that officials moved to ""lock down"" records of the call. The White House reportedly started securing call transcripts after the verbatim leaks of the president's calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico in 2017.

In a letter obtained by Fox News, top House Republicans urged Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson to preserve all records related to that revision, allegedly made sometime in August.

Specifically, they questioned whether the timing was related to the Ukraine complaint.

""When this revised form was published, and whether the whistleblower received a copy of this form when making the disclosure on August 12, 2019, are both unknown to the House Intelligence Committee. However, the timing of the removal of the first-hand information requirement raises questions about potential connections to this whistleblower’s complaint,"" said the letter signed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. ""This timing, along with numerous apparent leaks of classified information about the contents of this complaint, also raise questions about potential criminality in the handling of these matters.""

Cory Booker says he has reached his self-imposed fundraising goal to continue his White House bid.

“I have some incredible news, friend. Last night at 8:16 p.m., we reached our goal of $1.7 million -- a full day ahead of the deadline we set for ourselves,” the Democrat from New Jersey wrote in an email to supporters on Monday morning.

“Thanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I’m staying in this race -- and I’m in it to win,” Booker said.

Nine days ago the senator from New Jersey announced that if he didn’t haul in $1.7 million by the end of the month – which marks the end of the July-September third quarter of fundraising – he would likely end his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

2020 DEMOCRATIC FIELD POISED FOR NEW PURGE, WITH CRUCIAL DEADLINES LOOMING

Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Top Booker advisers have warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand and compete with the top-tier Democratic nomination rivals.

Booker raised $4.5 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, far behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

“We got to a point where we saw candidates that were raising multiples of what we were raising,” Booker told reporters on Thursday during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. “We were not going to be able to stay in competition with them unless we raise significant money, so I told the truth.”

With that in mind, Booker told his supporters on Monday that “this won’t be the last mountain we have to climb on our way to the nomination -- we have a lot more money to raise to continue being competitive with the better-funded campaigns in this race. I’ll be asking more of my supporters as we move forward in this campaign together.”

And he didn’t waste any time, setting another goal of raising an additional $217,000 by the end of Monday to put him over the $2 million mark since announcing his original pitch nine days ago.

Booker announced on Twitter late in the the afternoon on Monday that he reached the $2 million mark.

The Booker campaign has pushed back against descriptions of the fundraising goal as a kind of gimmick. But the candidate himself acknowledged one of his intentions was to pump up fundraising.

Asked last week by a reporter from New Hampshire Public Radio “if this is just a gambit to raise money or are you really on the cusp of not having enough money,” Booker answered “both.”

While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he has struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits, far behind the top-tier contenders.

The Booker campaign highlighted on Sunday that they’ve reached the higher donor threshold to qualify for November’s fifth-round debate. To make the stage, candidates receive contributions from at least 165,000 individual donors – including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

But Booker remains short of reaching the polling criteria."

“The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,” the progressive senator from Vermont stressed Monday as he introduced his Inequality Tax Plan.

SANDERS UPS THE ANTE, PROPOSING BIGGER WEALTH TAX THAN WARREN'S PLAN

Sanders, who’s running a second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, has made erasing income and wealth inequality central components of his White House bid. His new plan would raise taxes on companies with what he calls “exorbitant” pay gaps between their executives and workers.”

“It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you,” he said emphatically.

If Sanders is elected and his plan enacted, tax penalties will begin at 0.5 percent for companies paying their top executives from 50 to 100 times more than their typical workers. The penalties scale up all the way to 5 percent for companies paying their top executives more than 500 times what their average workers earn.

“Some corporations where workers are making terrible wages, the CEO is making 500 or a thousand times more than their employee,” Sanders said Monday at a campaign event in New Hampshire. “Over the last 30 years, the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom half of America has seen a decline in their wealth.”

The Sanders campaign said that if the senator’s campaign was in effect last year, banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase would have paid up to $991.6 million more in taxes, and Walmart $793.8 million more.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Sanders released his new tax proposal a week after he unveiled a plan to tax the wealthiest Americans to diminish income inequality and to begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.

“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders wrote on Twitter last week. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""

The senator’s plan followed a similar proposal earlier this year from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The Sanders and Warren plans to boost taxes on the ultrawealthy were criticized last week by 2020 Democratic rival Andrew Yang.

The tech entrepreneur, who’s seen his campaign surge in recent months said on Twitter: “I understand the spirit and appeal of a wealth tax. It makes sense that those who enjoy vast fortunes should pay back into the system, particularly given the concentrations of wealth in our winner-take-all economy.""

But, he added, ""implementation would be impractical and problematic.”

Sanders' return to New Hampshire came days after the most recent poll in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state – from Monmouth University -- indicated the senator fading to a distant third behind longtime frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren.

Sanders downplayed that poll during an interview Monday with NHTalkRadio.com. “We’re feeling great,” he said. The turnouts are great… I think we have a great organization here in New Hampshire.”

And he repeated he was confident that he would once again win the state that four years ago made him a household name across the country when he crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., was none too pleased with Trump with after the president took to Twitter to highlight a quote that conservative evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress made on “Fox & Friends Weekend” in which he theorized that a “Civil War-like fracture” would occur in the United States should Trump be removed from office.

“If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,” Trump tweeted the quote from Jeffress.

The tweet, which highlighted both Trump’s close ties with Jeffress and an escalation in the rhetoric from the president surrounding the impeachment inquiry, had Trump’s critics slamming what they say is stoking violence and creating a volatile situation.

“I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. [President Trump] I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President,” tweeted Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran who served as a pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan. “This is beyond repugnant.”

Trump’s tweet was also slammed by Democratic lawmakers, with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., calling on Republicans in the Senate to support the impeachment inquiry or condemn Trump for his comments.

Jeffress, who is the head of a 14,000-person-strong megachurch in Dallas, has a history of making controversial comments and is also closely tied to the president. The pastor has slammed the Mormon Church as a “cult,” called Christians who don’t support Trump “spineless morons,” and compared the president’s border wall to the gates of heaven because “not everybody’s going to be allowed in.”

Kinzinger’s rebuke is among the first from a Republican lawmaker since the impeachment inquiry was announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week.

JASON CHAFFETZ: REP. ADAM SCHIFF HAS PROVEN HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED – SHOULDN'T BE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIR

The assault by a Democratic speaker on a president she abhors was so transparent she indicted him before seeing any evidence, smeared him before hearing any proof, then executed him in the press without any concern for due process.

It all reminds one of Alice in Wonderland, where the Queen corrected the King’s sense of jurisprudence when she insisted “no, no…sentence first – verdict afterword.”

Then, with a straight face, Nancy Pelosi had the gall to look us square in the eye and say this has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with her disdain for President Donald Trump, nothing to do with her inability to control Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her liberal arsonists who are out to torch the system (and the speaker's leadership).

Seriously?

And just when we thought we had seen the final episode of “House of Cards.”

Here’s what we know.

Our president called Ukraine’s president to congratulate him on his party’s parliamentary victory. That’s what leaders do when other leaders have a good day.

There was no quid pro quo, no trading of promised military aid for political help, no pressure or demand that Ukraine act – or else!

During that call, confirmed by release of the transcript of that conversation, the president briefly referenced the dropped investigation of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, over allegations the vice president may have unfairly influenced an investigation there, and further asked for help in learning more about how corruption from abroad threatened America’s electoral system.

There was no quid pro quo, no trading of promised military aid for political help, no pressure or demand that Ukraine act – or else!

The Democrats, even before knowing any of this, said Donald Trump is clearly guilty of the “high crimes and misdemeanors” standard for impeachment contained in Article 1, Section 2, of the United States Constitution.

The president’s crime?

He won the 2016 election.

His offense? He’s doing what he promised, by taking on a system that threatens the middle class, domestic tranquility and national security.

His sin?

Donald Trump has led America to its best economic report card in decades.

At the same time, the president took on China for abusing trade, Venezuela for abusing its people, and “terrorist-central” Iran for bombing Saudi Arabia.

Pelosi and her henchmen didn’t want to hear any of that.

Instead, they promoted a political lynching they were denied when the 674-day Mueller investigation proved no wrongdoing and the Kavanaugh nomination was approved. Choreographed for effect, they went ballistic over an allegation without waiting to see it, read it or vet it, as if facts and evidence were some inconvenience, some technical points to be addressed later.

Trump’s decision to seek that assistance has put him in peril of losing the office he is desperate to keep.

It’s also clear to me it’s not the first time.

It’s the third time … at least.

You can draw a straight line from Trump standing on a stage in Miami on July 27, 2016, when he said “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,"" pleading with Russia to locate Hillary Clinton’s emails to last Thursday on the White House lawn pleading with China to investigate the Biden’s. “China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” said Trump.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: IF THE HOUSE WON'T VOTE, IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS JUST A DEMOCRATIC STUNT

In plain sight, and in my opinion, Trump is asking foreign governments for help in his elections. That is illegal. Just as his request of Ukraine to investigate Biden is illegal. As I wrote last week, and repeatedly stated, it is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

That one request, without anything else, is enough to seek impeachment. However, it appears these three examples may not be the only occasions Trump asked a foreign government for election assistance.

Now, it is reported that Trump raised Biden in a call with President Xi of China on June 18 as well … a full three months before his appearance on the White House lawn last week. A record of that call was also stored in the highly secured electronic system with the one to Ukraine's President Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry into Trump.

And like the call to Zelensky, the White House did not deny that Trump discussed Biden and the 2020 campaign in his call to Xi. In fact, China acknowledged it just as Trump and Ukraine confirmed their call too. Did Trump ask China for help with Biden in that conversation? Unless Trump releases the full transcript of the call we may not know what happened.

But, we are about to learn much more about foreign assistance provided to Trump in the 2016 election, and what he may have known about it during the Roger Stone WikiLeaks trial scheduled to begin on Nov. 5 in the midst of the Impeachment Inquiry.

In plain sight, and in my opinion, Trump is asking foreign governments for help in his elections.

Stone, a longtime political adviser to Trump, was indicted on seven counts of obstruction, lying to Congress, and witness tampering as a result of Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Specifically, the focus of this trial is whether Stone coordinated with WikiLeaks/Julian Assange, who published approximately 55,000 emails prosecutors say were hacked by Russian operatives from the Democratic National Committee to harm the Clinton campaign. It is alleged that Stone was in frequent contact with at least four members of Trump’s campaign about the WikiLeaks effort to release the emails before the 2016 election.

Not only will we learn about the role Stone, Assange and WikiLeaks played in interfering with our 2016 election, we may also learn that Trump knew about their efforts despite his repeated denials for the past three years.

Currently, the section of the Mueller Report about ""contacts with the (Trump) campaign about WikiLeaks"" is largely redacted because if it is made public then it could harm an ongoing matter. That ongoing matter is the Stone WikiLeaks trial.

Last week, the House Judiciary Committee submitted a court filing seeking secret grand jury testimony from the Mueller Report for the impeachment inquiry. In it they cited a footnote in the Mueller Report about Paul Manafort speaking to Trump after WikiLeaks released the hacked documents in July 2016 that implies Trump knew about Russia’s involvement.

The Mueller Report recounts a conversation between Trump and Rick Gates, his deputy campaign chairman who has been cooperating with federal authorities, where ""Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming"".

Manafort ""recalled that Trump responded that Manafort should (REDACTED: Harm to Ongoing Matter) keep Trump updated,"" after discussing the WikiLeaks release of the hacked Democratic National Committee files during the DNC Convention in July 2016.

While the House Judiciary Committee may not succeed in getting the secret grand jury testimony it is very likely that the information in the now redacted section of the Mueller Report is revealed during the trial.

When this material is revealed it is also likely to show that Trump lied about his knowledge regarding Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, including in his written responses to Mueller’s questions about it.

If that is true then it is a stunning development that further fuels the impeachment inquiry as it casts even more doubt about Trump’s actions in the 2016 and 2020 elections, inviting even more scrutiny, that could bring more articles of impeachment, and charges when Trump leaves the White House.

Every time there is a request for foreign help in Trump’s campaigns all roads lead to Donald Trump. So far that has happened at least three times, Russia, Ukraine, and China. Each request is illegal. And it is possible there may be even more.

That’s why Trump is facing the possibility of impeachment.

And when all the facts are known I believe Trump could face a fate much worse than impeachment too.

Because it’s crucial for the far-left to get you to believe that President Trump is a danger to national security.

Russia collusion didn’t happen, so House Democrats shuffled through their options and picked Ukraine.

PETER SCHWEIZER: BIDEN UKRAINE DEALINGS – 7 ESSENTIAL FACTS

“I think focusing on this Ukrainian scandal singularly is important,” said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. Ukraine “is clearly going to be the issue that’s going to drive the bus,” said Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich.

More like the Magic Bus. Hear their chant. The President “has put national security at risk in order to advance his own narrow personal interests,” fears Kildee, who is Chief Deputy Whip of the House Democratic Caucus and released his formal statement Sep. 24.

As you can tell, the far-left obsession with impeaching Trump is emotional and partisan. So much unhappiness. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still regards Trump as “an illegitimate president” as she told CBS on Thursday, Sep 26.

The Bill Clinton impeachment did not involve foreign policy. Nor did the Nixon impeachment inquiry; however, a fourth Article on bombing Cambodia was actually voted down in the summer of 1974, along with a fifth article on Nixon’s taxes.

But there’s a scary reason why the attack from these unhappy impeacheroos now requires dragging US diplomacy through the muck with Ukraine as a star player.

Impeachment needs high crimes and misdemeanors – and something Americans will buy into. The Dem caucus is banking on the fact that most of us Americans don’t follow Ukraine closely.

They don’t talk about the tense military confrontation there, the 13,000 deaths, or if new President Volodymir Zelensky can clean up corruption and fulfill his election pledge for peace talks with Russia. The far-left doesn’t remember Lt. Col. Seth Nehring, the Fresno, California Air National Guard fighter pilot who died there last fall assisting Ukrainian forces. (He was killed flying with a Ukranian pilot on a training mission.)

To get the impeachment show going, the far-left and others obsessed with President Trump need you to believe he’s doing critical damage to our national security.

That’s simply not the case.

Our military is stronger. President Trump reorganized defense spending so that fighting forces get training and spare parts. Navy F/A-18EF fighter planes on aircraft carriers now meet their minimum 80% readiness goals. Programs are funded to keep the US edge in high technology like hypersonic missiles.

Trump took on China’s bad behavior after 20 years of Clinton-Bush-Obama drift. Trump’s gradual implementation of tariffs called out China’s unfair business practices and intellectual property theft and ongoing cybercrimes.

NATO is stronger, too. NATO stood with U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty, and the alliance is making strides in deterring Russian aggression.

In the Persian Gulf, Britain, France and Germany last week came over to the US position and named Iran as the perpetrator of the shocking attack on Saudi oilfields. Those three big allies also now support Trump’s insistence that Iran talk about serious new restrictions on nuclear activity, military aggression and missile proliferation.

Ukraine policy is stronger. President Obama wouldn’t deliver the funding for lethal aid to Ukraine requested by Congress. Trump authorized lethal aid in December 2017, including Javelin anti-tank weapons, common in NATO.

What worries me is that the anti-Trump outrage is starting to damage international security. When former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says “I know he’s an illegitimate President,” I believe her statement is bad for American foreign policy.

OK, then she believes every meeting, treaty and agreement since Trump was inaugurated is null and void? The strikes on Syrian chemical weapons facilities in 2017 and 2018 were not legitimate? Is that really her view? Why does she try to undermine a duly elected president in his third year in office?

The Democratic impeachment poseurs want you to believe Trump is shredding American policy behind closed doors. Don’t fall for it.

Could the president watch his mouth? Sure. But I will take his boisterous activity over Obama’s cynical inaction any day.

My research showed that what took place in the weeks after the Trump-Zelensky call was a lot of normal foreign policy meetings. Vice President Mike Pence met Zelensky in Warsaw on Sep. 1. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry met with Zelensky. Senator Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn., met Zelensky on Sep. 5. Pompeo telephoned Ukraine Foreign Minister Prystayko on Sep. 17. Business as usual. And the foreign aid as appropriated by Congress is on its way.

Hardly a clear and present danger. Let the American people decide on November 3, 2020.

That anonymous complaint, which spurred congressional Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry last week, was based on second-hand accounts from “more than half a dozen U.S. officials.”

READ THE COMPLAINT

It alleged that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family – something the now-public transcript of the call with President Volodymyr Zelensky confirms. And it included a variety of other disputed allegations, including that officials moved to “lock down” records of the call.

But, in a detail first reported by The Federalist, a key form was recently revised to drop a requirement that such complaints include first-hand information in order to be sent to Congress.

However, the intelligence community inspector general said in a lengthy statement Monday that the whistleblower had filled out the older version of the form, which retained the requirement that whistleblowers have firsthand information. The watchdog revealed that the whistleblower had said he or she had firsthand information, as well as second-hand information. It remained unclear what the firsthand information was.

The watchdog wrote: ""In the process of reviewing and clarifying those forms, and in response to recent press inquiries regarding the instant whistleblower complaint, the ICIG understood that certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read – incorrectly – as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees.""

In a letter obtained by Fox News, top House Republicans urged Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson to preserve all records related to that revision, allegedly made sometime in August.

Specifically, they questioned whether the timing was related to the Ukraine complaint.

“When this revised form was published, and whether the whistleblower received a copy of this form when making the disclosure on August 12, 2019, are both unknown to the House Intelligence Committee. However, the timing of the removal of the first-hand information requirement raises questions about potential connections to this whistleblower’s complaint,” said the letter signed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. “This timing, along with numerous apparent leaks of classified information about the contents of this complaint, also raise questions about potential criminality in the handling of these matters.”

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the inspector general’s office have not responded to requests, first made Friday by Fox News, for comment about the disclosure form and whether changes were made.

At issue is the standard, along with other criteria, used to determine whether a complaint of “urgent concern” is deemed “credible.” Atkinson previously reported to Congress that he indeed had determined the Ukraine call complaint appeared credible. However, the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel found the complaint did not meet the “urgent concern” standard which required immediate congressional notification.

READ THE TRUMP-UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT

The Republicans noted that a prior version of the form published in May 2018 included clear language saying a whistleblower must have first-hand information to be deemed credible.

According to the letter, it stated: “In order to find an urgent concern ‘credible,’ the ICIG must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The ICIG cannot transmit information via the [Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act] based on an employee’s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. This includes information received from another person, such as when a fellow employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing. (Anyone with first-hand knowledge of the allegations may file a disclosure in writing directly with the ICIG.) Similarly, speculation about the existence of wrongdoing does not provide sufficient legal basis to meet the statutory requirements of the ICWPA. If you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions, ICIG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA.”

The requirement has since been dropped.

Trump seized on the apparent change with an all-caps tweet Monday morning: “WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!”

In their letter, Republicans told Atkinson to view their correspondence as a “preservation order for all documents and communications from your office related to the matters discussed herein.” They went on to include a long list of questions concerning when the form was updated, why it was updated, who approved the revisions and more.

There are questions, though, over whether the prior form may have been flawed.

Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, noted that the relevant statute and other underlying directives do not require such whistleblower disclosures to have “firsthand” information. He called the new form “consistent with the law.”

“If anything’s sketchy here, honestly, it’s not the current form, but the old one: Precisely because it could easily be misread as implying you aren’t entitled to protection if you disclose abuses learned about indirectly. Which would be a serious misrepresentation of the law,” he tweeted.

Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have sent their own letter to Atkinson asking for details on the change. The letter likewise noted they are not aware of any federal law requiring first-hand information in order for such complaints to be “accepted as credible,” but questioned the timeline and why the requirement was initially in place.

That letter was sent by Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.

As the complaint, the transcript and the various allegations surrounding both documents provide the basis for the official impeachment probe, Trump-allied Republicans claim Democrats are jumping to conclusions. During testimony last week before the House Intelligence Committee, Acting DNI Joseph Maguire described the complaint as “hearsay.”

“Our roles in the House of Representatives place us in the forefront of the impeachment crisis manufactured by Congressional Democrats,” the House Republicans wrote in their letter to Atkinson, setting a Thursday deadline. Atkinson is set to appear in a closed session before the House Intelligence Committee the following day."

The fact that Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is set to appear for his private deposition is the next step for the panels leading the probe, after difficulties scheduling other requested testimonies. Lawmakers will be testing Sondland’s willingness to offer clear answers and his loyalty to Trump.

Sondland, a hotel executive who donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, came under increased scrutiny last week after Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, turned over text messages in his closed deposition that showed Sondland seeking to encourage Ukrainian officials to agree to “the deliverable.”

To get to the bottom of that request, Democrats are trying to establish what leverage Trump used to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, now a political rival for the 2020 election. They have faced broad resistance from the Trump administration, as the president and his legal counsel reject demands for documents and witness testimony.

Trump has responded furiously to the impeachment process, calling the inquiry a “scam” and a “witch hunt.” He will hold political rallies this week in Minnesota and Louisiana, and will likely offer his own defense to his most passionate supporters.

The heart of the House inquiry, led by the committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight, is the accusation that Trump sought to use U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get that country to pursue probes, including one against the Bidens, The committees are requesting testimony from State Department officials and others who may have helped Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, push Ukrainian officials to comply.

‘Navigate’ Trump’s Demands

The contents of Trump’s July 25 call with Zelenskiy was initially revealed in a complaint filed by a intelligence community whistle-blower, whose identity remains unknown. That report details Sondland’s trip to Kyiv with Volker on July 26 -- a day after Trump’s call -- to meet “with President Zelenskiy and a variety of Ukrainian political figures.”

According to the whistle-blower’s complaint, “Ambassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to ‘navigate’ the demands that the president had made of Mr. Zelenskiy.”

Story continues

The texts given to the committees last week also show that Sondland and another top American diplomat helped script a proposed announcement by Ukraine’s leader to say his government would investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. That announcement was never made.

The texts also show Sondland defending Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to look into the Bidens, even over concerns raised by the top American diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, who warned against conditioning U.S. military assistance on an “investigation.”

“As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Taylor wrote on Sept. 9.

Sondland replied that Trump isn’t seeking “a quid pro quo,” but wanted to test Ukraine’s commitment to reform. He then suggested they stop texting and said Taylor should speak directly to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.

Though Ukraine is not part of the European Union, the documents now made public show that Sondland, the ambassador to the E.U., played a central role in Trump’s efforts to convince Ukrainian leaders to carry out the investigations.

Some Democrats, including Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia, a Democratic member of the Oversight Committee, say Sondland should resign.

“These text messages are deeply troubling. Mr. Sondland has lost credibility and must resign,” said Connolly, in a statement.

Subpoenas Threatened

Sondland’s testimony comes after the lawyer for two Giuliani associates -- Ukrainian-born businessman Lev Parnes and his business partner Igor Fruman -- said on Monday they would, for now, put off a request to testify and turn over additional documents by Oct. 14. The committees are prepared to respond with subpoenas to force them to testify, according to a House official.

The House request is “overly broad and unduly burdensome” and “beyond the scope” of the inquiry, John Dowd, the lawyer representing Parnes and Fruman, wrote in an Oct. 3 letter to the House Intelligence Committee obtained by Bloomberg News.

Dowd said lawyers need time to review the documents for material that should instead be withheld under legal privileges. He asked the committees to amend their requests and said he would keep them advised about a “rolling production of non-privileged documents.”

Dowd previously represented Trump as a personal lawyer during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Dowd said the committees’ deadline for responses, which he said were made in a Sept. 30 letter, led him to believe the Democratic leaders of the panels want “to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.”

At least one other witness, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, is scheduled to testify on Friday.

The leaders of the three committees, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings on Monday subpoenaed the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget for documents related to “the reasons behind the White House’s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress.” That subpoena requires a response by Oct. 15.

Fox News Exclusive: Joe, Hunter Biden seen golfing with Ukraine gas company exec back in 2014, photo shows

A photo obtained by Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" shows former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter. Earlier this month, Joe Biden told Fox News in Iowa that he never discussed his son’s foreign business dealings with him. “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said, pointing the finger at President Trump. “I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.”

Hunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about his work in Ukraine. A source told Fox News the photo was taken in August 2014. News reports at the time indicated the vice president was in the Hamptons. Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma Holdings board in April 2014. Click here for more on our top story.

Giuliani blasts Biden camp for trying to 'silence' him; Pompeo listened in on Trump-Ukraine call: report

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president, a senior State Department official told the Wall Street Journal. The report would appear to support Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani's claims on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that Pompeo was aware of his efforts to encourage Ukraine’s government to investigate the Bidens. Over the weekend, the Democratic chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed Pompeo for documents related to Ukraine they said were critical to their probe.

House Democrats on Monday subpoenaed Giuliani's text messages, phone records, and other documents and communications as part of their formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump. In an interview on ""Hannity,"" Giuliani blasted the Biden camp for apparently trying to ""silence"" him by encouraging media outlets not to book him as a guest. The former New York City mayor said the Democrats are going to turn into the ""party of corruption."" Meanwhile, top Republicans are wondering whether Trump is a victim of a ""political setup"" by Democrats in the Ukraine call controversy, thanks to comments made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Sunday.

Barr asked Trump to speak to other countries in probe of Russia investigation, official says; source pushes back on New York Times reporting

Separately, a Justice Department official told Fox News on Monday that Attorney General William Barr asked President Trump to make introductions to foreign countries that might have had information pertinent to U.S. Attorney John Durham's ongoing probe into the origins of the Russia collusion investigation and possible misconduct by the intelligence community. But, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News it would be wrong to say Trump ""pressed"" the Australian prime minister for information that could have discredited former Special Counsel Mueller's now-completed probe, as the New York Times reported earlier Monday.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., slammed the Times report on ""Hannity,"" calling it an ""effort"" to shut down Barr's investigation.

Fox News Exclusive: WinRed, new GOP donor platform, reaps impeachment windfall, rakes in millions

WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised over $28 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats’ impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned. WinRed raised $28.1 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday. The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.

Mega mall owners mull investing in Forever 21 after bankruptcy

Two mall titans may invest in the bankrupt teen retailer Forever 21. The retailer filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday morning and recently tried to cut a deal in which its two largest landlords, Brookfield Property and Simon Property, would take an ownership stake, according to the New York Post. The reason is Forever 21 uses a lot of mall space with its 541 stores. The nationwide closure of 178 locations would leave big holes at shopping malls. Negotiations between the retailer, Brookfield, and Simon reached an impasse over the weekend and are considered dead -- for now.

* Late Friday afternoon, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said the Vermonter was hospitalized following a heart attack in Las Vegas last week. There is no reason to believe this will derail the 78-year-old senator’s presidential campaign, though he is now at home recuperating.

* The latest Fox News poll in South Carolina shows Joe Biden with a sizable lead over his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. The results showed the former vice president with 41%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 12% and Bernie Sanders at 10%.

* Fox News yesterday also released its latest poll out of Wisconsin, where Biden leads Warren by a much narrower margin, 28% to 22%, with Sanders not far behind with 18%. The same survey showed each of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination leading Donald Trump in Wisconsin in hypothetical match-ups, with Biden enjoying the largest advantage (nine points) and Warren enjoying the smallest lead over the president (four points).

* The Warren presidential campaign announced late last week that it has fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after an investigation into “multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior.”

* As of this morning, it appears that Sen. Cory Booker and Tom Steyer have qualified to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate in November, bringing the new total of participants to seven. In contrast, 12 candidates are slated to appear in next week’s debate.

* Biden wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, responding to Trump’s offensive against him, and it concluded, “[T]o Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

* Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters on Friday that if Warren is elected president, Power isn’t ruling out the possibility of running for her seat.

* And in a curious tweet, later promoted by Donald Trump, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel suggested donor support is most important indicator of the president’s public standing, arguing, “Dollars are the real polls right now.”"

* Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) became the latest House Republican to announce his retirement this morning. He’s also the sixth Texas Republican this year to call it quits ahead of the 2020 cycle. (Thornberry, incidentally, represents the single reddest House district in the country, which suggests the GOP will keep his seat.)

* In South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary, the latest CNN poll shows Joe Biden maintaining his lead with 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 16% and Bernie Sanders at 11%. No other candidate topped 5%.

* In Nevada, meanwhile, CNN’s poll found Biden and Sanders tied at 22% each, while Warren was third at 18%. Kamala Harris was fourth with 5%.

* Cory Booker’s team suggested the New Jersey senator would end his Democratic presidential campaign if it fell short of its quarterly fundraising goals, but Booker announced via Twitter that his operation reached its target.

* Though competitive presidential candidates from both parties have steered clear of accepting public financing in recent years, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock will apparently become the first Democratic contender to participate in the system.

* In South Carolina, CNN’s poll found 62% percent of Republican voters approve of their state party’s decision to cancel the GOP presidential primary. That’s an unflattering rebuke of Mark Sanford, the former governor and congressman from South Carolina, who’s challenging Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.

* For reasons I cannot explain, the National Republican Congressional Committee thought it’d be a good idea to publicly mock freshman Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) for having been to marriage counseling with his wife.

* And following up on an item from last week, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was the only Democratic presidential campaign to balk at an impeachment inquiry targeting Trump, but she’s since changed her mind."

I don’t know how anyone familiar with the English language can think it is a good branding ploy to name their company Fraud Guarantee. But that is exactly what Lev Parnas and David Correia did back in 2013. As the chief executive officer and chief operating officer they somehow attracted strategic advice and possibly seed money from Philip Reicherz who runs a venture capital fund called Magnolia Ventures. The company began with $1.5 million in the bank.

But their website indicates a defunct enterprise premised on vague promises of protection against investor fraud. The screenshot below is current as of October 15, 2019. It shows that they are promising to roll out their primary product, InvestSafe™, in the Spring of 2016. Either that never happened or they have a very lazy person running their website.

You can see that they were also saying they could provide a technology that would be an improvement on standard background checks. So, here we can see where they might be in need of some technological consulting work. Maybe back in 2015 or the winter of 2016, they might have hired someone for that purpose. Maybe a genius could figure out how to get a “technology” to listen for people “talking about fraudulent activity” by “scour[ing] the internet” and “crunch[ing] the data.” That’s certainly something some law enforcement and intelligence agencies are capable of doing. Why not two dudes in Boca Raton?

So, this is what Fraud Guarantee looks like. And here is what Rudy Giuliani has to say about it:

President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday… …Giuliani said [Lev] Parnas’ company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients “reduce and mitigate fraud”, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee’s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.

Maybe it’s me, but August 2018 seems far too late to be offering technology advice to Fraud Guarantee. And this is a company that started with $1.5 million in seed money and never seems to have developed a product. How can they afford to pay Rudy Giuliani $500,000?

The New York Times reported last week that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice. Giuliani said for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $500,000. Giuliani told Reuters the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other. He said he could not recall the dates of the payments. He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year.

It would be fascinating to see Giuliani explain to a prosecutor or congressional committee what kind of work he performed in 2018 and the nature of his follow-up work in 2019.

As for those two wire transfers Giuliani received, he says we shouldn’t worry about them.

According to an indictment unsealed by U.S. prosecutors, an unidentified Russian businessman arranged for two $500,000 wires to be sent from foreign bank accounts to a U.S. account controlled by [Igor] Fruman in September and October 2018. The money was used, in part, by Fruman, Parnas and two other men charged in the indictment to gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates, the indictment said. Foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with U.S. elections, and from making contributions in someone else’s name. Giuliani said he was confident that the money he received was from “a domestic source,” but he would not say where it came from. “I know beyond any doubt the source of the money is not any questionable source,” he told Reuters in an interview. “The money did not come from foreigners. I can rule that out 100%,” he said.

I’ve been saying that this is the biggest scandal in American political history, and this is just a small piece of it. Even John Bolton, of all people, wanted nothing to do this operation.

The aide, Fiona Hill, testified that Mr. Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by [Ambassador to the European Union] Mr. Sondland, Mr. Giuliani and [White House chief of staff] Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to the people familiar the testimony. “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” Mr. Bolton, a Yale-trained lawyer, told Ms. Hill to tell White House lawyers, according to two people at the deposition… …It was not the first time Mr. Bolton expressed grave concerns to Ms. Hill about the campaign being run by Mr. Giuliani. “Giuliani’s a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up,” Ms. Hill quoted Mr. Bolton as saying during an earlier conversation.

It’s amazing that Giuliani is still talking and still spinning. He says he’s 100% certain that he was not the recipient of two wire transfers totaling a half a million dollars that were sent by “an unidentified Russian businessman” to “gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates” even as he freely admits that was paid exactly that amount in two wire transfers by the very same people.

As you might expect, and as the Wall Street Journal is reporting, federal prosectors are hot on Giuliani’s trail. They are not going to be any more satisfied with his answers than I am, and they have the tools to prove he’s a liar.

Lev Parnas and David Correia have both been arrested, along with Andrey Kukushkin and Igor Fruman. Two of them, Parnas and Fruman, were nailed at Dulles International Airport shortly after having lunch with Giuliani at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. They were scheduled to testify before Congress but had one-way tickets indicating that they had no intention of fulfilling that commitment.

And, yet, Giuliani is still insisting on his innocence. He’s still saying things that can and will be used against him in a court of law.

And Trump is still complaining about the initial whistleblower, as if half his administration were not exposing the whole thing in sworn depositions before the House Intelligence Committee."

In his second rally in as many nights -- following Thursday's rally in Minneapolis -- Trump also ridiculed the ongoing impeachment inquiry spearheaded by House Democrats, whom he called ""scammers and con artists,""

""They know they can't win an election,"" Trump told a packed arena in Lake Charles, La., ""so they're pursuing an illegal, unconstitutional bulls--- impeachment.""

""They know they can't win an election so they're pursuing an illegal, unconstitutional bulls--- impeachment."" — President Trump

The president's use of the barnyard epithet drew a roar from the crowd, just as a profane joke about former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden did a night earlier in Minnesota. On Friday, Pelosi described Trump's Obama-Biden crack as ""disgraceful,"" possibly prompting the president's Louisiana remark about the speaker.

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

On Friday, Trump also attacked Biden and his son Hunter Biden over their Ukrainian business dealings for the second night in a row, accusing the media of covering up potential Biden corruption and complaining that if any of his children were similarly accused, the media wouldn't call the allegations unsubstantiated — ""They would be saying, 'Where's the nearest cell?'""

The president decried the ""rage-filled Democrat Party that has gone completely insane"" accusing them of waging a ""nonstop battle"" to ""overthrow"" his presidency.

Trump also mocked ex-FBI officials and lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page again saying ""these people are corrupt. These people are disgusting.""

""This is the witch hunt,"" he said. ""They've been trying to stop us for three years with a lot of crap.""

Trump's appearance in Louisiana was scheduled to help rally Republican voters against the state's Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.

""Tomorrow you will head to the polls and vote to replace a liberal Democrat who has sold you out, John Bel Edwards, with a great Republican governor,"" Trump said in his remarks, encouraging Louisianians to get to the polls before Saturday night's big college football matchup between unbeaten Louisiana State University and the University of Florida or else they would feel guilty and ""it will ruin your entire afternoon.""

The president was joined onstage by both U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, but did not endorse either candidate in order to maximize chances that Edwards will fall below the 50 percent vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff in Saturday's gubernatorial ""jungle primary,"" in which all the candidates appear on a single ballot.

""You're not allowed to hit your Republican opponent, you're only allowed to hit John Bel Edwards,"" Trump said, extending an olive branch between the two GOP candidates, who have been at loggerheads in the race to the governor's mansion.

The president's trip to Louisiana came one day after another fiery rally in Minneapolis, during which Trump also slammed House Democrats and their impeachment inquiry against him.

TRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY, AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OUTSIDE ARENA

The president touted the country's economy and boasted about the truce reached with China just hours before he landed in Louisiana, which stipulates that China will purchase up to $50 billion worth of agricultural goods from American farmers and also will postpone tariffs on Chinese goods that were originally set to take effect next week.

""I just made a great China deal today for energy, for the farmers, for the banks... I want to tell you, I got China to order a lot!""

He did not mention the growing issue of censorship in the U.S. over ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

""We've ended the war on American energy, and with your help, right here in Louisiana, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on the planet!"" Trump also boasted.

He also slammed Edwards for the state's tax hike, which was passed with Republican support.

""You are going to fire your Democratic governor who has done a lousy job and send a great Republican to the governor's mansion,"" Trump said.

Other top Republicans, including Vice President Pence and Donald Trump Jr., have paid visits to the state, which Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016.

Neither Abraham nor Rispone has been able to break away as the top competitor, even as Rispone poured $11 million of his own personal wealth into the campaign. Party leaders' efforts to keep the men from fighting each other have failed, raising concerns the backbiting could wound both GOP contenders and help Edwards. Republicans blame attacks among their own candidates for helping to elect Edwards four years ago.

Edwards isn't the type of liberal, anti-Trump Democrat with whom the president usually clashes.

Louisiana's governor is an anti-abortion, pro-gun West Point graduate who avoids criticizing Trump, talks about his strong rapport with the White House and calls the impeachment inquiry a distraction for Washington.

""He's 100 percent going to drop the second Amendment ... John Bel Edwards will not protect your second amendment,"" Trump told the crowd.

While Edwards' efforts to keep the president at bay in the governor's race have been unsuccessful, the Democratic incumbent isn't complaining about the rallies. Instead, he has downplayed them, calling it unsurprising that Trump backs members of his own party in the ""hyperpartisan"" environment of Washington. He said he would continue to ""work well"" with the president and focus on his own, bipartisan approach to governing.

""When my opponents realized just how much support my campaign had from the people of Louisiana, they started calling in help from forces in Washington, D.C.,"" Edwards said. ""My opponents are obsessed with political partisanship because the only way they think they can win is to divide the state of Louisiana.""

Republicans nationally have targeted Edwards for ouster since his longshot election victory four years ago. But work to unify around one major contender failed, with the state's top-tier, well-known GOP officials passing on the race.

Trump was also joined on stage by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who said: ""I told you, Donald J. Trump loves Louisiana like the devil loves sin.""

He also invited the Eastbank All-Stars, the Little League baseball championship team that joined him at the White House earlier in the day and then flew on Air Force One to the rally, to come on stage in Louisiana.

In fact, the Republican described his perception of the Democrats’ tactics.

“[T]hey’re of the opinion, you know, just keep saying it, saying it, saying it, and maybe someday they’ll believe it,” Trump said.

It was a curious failure of self-awareness for the president. He was, after all, describing one of his most commonly used tactics and attributing it to his critics. And therein lies the rub: as the walls close in on Trump, projection remains his go-to move.

A few days later, the president hosted a White House meeting with congressional leaders, which was derailed by what some participants described as Trump’s “meltdown.” After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Americans should “pray for his health,” the Republican responded in his patented I’m-rubber-you’re-glue sort of way, published a tweet accusing Pelosi of being mentally ill, and added, “Pray for her, she is a very sick person!”

Since he heard the Speaker accuse him of a “meltdown,” Trump also accused Pelosi of having had a “meltdown.”

All of which led to the Republican’s campaign rally last night in Texas, held just a few hours after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged the White House’s quid-pro-quo scheme with Ukraine. Trump responded by accusing Joe Biden of trying to execute a quid-pro-quo scheme in Ukraine.

Trump said that the former vice president was in charge of Ukraine policy for the Obama administration and sought the firing of the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general while his son, Hunter “was paid massive sums of money [to] buy a Ukrainian energy company.” “Now that’s what you call quid pro quo,” Trump said.

No, in reality, it’s not. Biden, with bipartisan and international backing, urged Ukraine to dismiss an inept prosecutor who wasn’t investigating the Ukrainian company in question. It bears literally no resemblance to a quid pro quo.

But the fact that the president is pushing the fraudulent line anyway brings a simple truth into focus: Trump genuinely seems to believe he can “no puppet” his way through his impeachment crisis.

I hope you caught Rachel’s segment last week on Trump’s dependence on the rhetorical ploy: “What we have already started living through here is an effort … to turn the behavior for which the president has now been caught, not just into some amorphous and unnecessarily complicated thing that doesn’t really have any inherent meaning, but also to try to make his sins our sins. To try to absolve himself of his own crimes by putting what he did and – what he and his sort of henchmen in Ukraine have been doing – to try to put those crimes on everybody else’s rap sheet.”

It’s become a staple of Trump’s presidency. As regular readers know, the Republican has a playbook for defending himself, and projection is the first page.

A couple of months ago, for example, Trump faced condemnations after using racist rhetoric against four Democratic congresswomen of color. The president responded by accusing the congresswomen of being racists.

A couple of months before that, following a series of bizarre incidents, Trump was accused of mental decline. He responded by accusing Nancy Pelosi of being in mental decline.

Circling back to our earlier coverage, it’s a tactic that’s come to define his entire approach to politics: like an intemperate child, Trump’s I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I instincts are finely tuned after extensive practice.

When Democrats accused the president of a variety of crimes, Trump insisted the “real crimes were committed” by Democrats. When Dems argued the president obstructed justice, Trump replied that it’s the Dems who have obstructed justice.

Confronted with allegations that his political operation colluded with Russian attackers, Trump said Democrats colluded with Russia. Told that the Kremlin supported his candidacy, Trump responded by saying Russia supported Democrats. Accused of being a manipulated pawn for Vladimir Putin, Trump accused Barack Obama of being Putin’s “patsy.”

And during the 2016 campaign: whenever Hillary Clinton would criticize Trump, it was a near certainty that Trump would then make the identical accusation against Clinton. After a while, as regular readers may recall, this got a little creepy.

Clinton accused Trump of being unstable and reckless, so Trump said Clinton is “unstable” and “reckless.” Clinton said Trump mistreated women, so Trump said Clinton mistreated women. Clinton accused Trump of bigotry, so Trump said Clinton’s a “bigot.” Clinton questioned Trump’s temperament, so Trump said Clinton had a bad “temperament.” Clinton said Trump makes a poor role model for children, so Trump said Clinton sets “a terrible example for my son and the children in this country.”

And, of course, Clinton accused Trump of being a “puppet” for his allies in Moscow during a 2016 debate. Trump, showing all of the sophistication of a slow toddler, responded, “No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet. No, you’re the puppet.”

With a track record like this one, is it really any wonder Trump is falsely accusing Biden of a quid pro quo?"
790,Steve Benen,"When Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal first broke two weeks ago, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) responded with lazy partisanship, telling Fox News the real controversy was Joe Biden getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son.
Even those who’ve come to … [+3607 chars]",Marco Rubio's initial response to Trump's Ukraine scandal was pitiful. His newest response was quite a bit worse.,2019-10-04,MSNBC,Rubio does himself no favors with weak...,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rubio-does-himself-no-favors-weak-defense-trump-scandal,"When Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal first broke two weeks ago, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) responded with lazy partisanship, telling Fox News the real controversy was Joe Biden getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son.

Even those who’ve come to expect very little from Rubio were struck by the pitiful response. As the Florida Republican must know, the former vice president – representing the bipartisan position of the United States and much of the Western world – targeted an inept prosecutor who wasn’t pursuing a company Biden’s son was associated with. Rubio’s reflexive effort to defend Trump by smearing Biden didn’t even make sense.

This week, however, the GOP senator was handed a great opportunity to redeem himself. Rubio has earned a reputation as a fierce China critic, so when his party’s president publicly sought Beijing’s assistance in targeting a domestic opponent yesterday, it offered the Floridian the chance to do the right thing, put country over party, and rebuke Donald Trump’s obvious abuse.

Alas, as the Miami Herald reported, the senator chose a different path.

[W]hen President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly called on China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival, Rubio said Trump’s words were a ruse. “I don’t know if that’s a real request or him just needling the press knowing that you guys are going to get outraged by it,” Rubio told reporters at an economic opportunity event in the Florida Keys on Friday. “He’s pretty good at getting everybody fired up and he’s been doing that for a while and the media responded right on task.” […] “I don’t think that’s a real request. I think he did it to gig you guys [reporters],” Rubio said. “I think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it. He plays it like a violin and everybody falls right in, that’s not a real request.”

As Republican talking points go, this comes up from time to time as a way of shrugging off assorted Trump abuses. Last year, for example, when the White House went after the security clearances of former intelligence officials who’ve criticized the president, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters, “I think he’s trolling people, honestly.”

In that example, Ryan may have had a point; Trump didn’t actually follow through. In the effort to compel foreign officials to help the president’s re-election campaign, however, Rubio, in a rather literal sense, doesn’t appear to know what he’s talking about.

In fact, if there’s one thing that even the most unobservant Republicans should understand at this point, it’s that Trump wasn’t just popping off on Twitter or during an impromptu Q&A. The president and his team hatched a deliberate scheme, involving a variety of officials and offices, in the hopes of trying to coerce campaign assistance out of foreign governments.

Trump wasn’t trolling or trying to get a rise out of reporters; the media didn’t even know about the president’s efforts until reports of a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower came to the fore.

On the White House South Lawn yesterday, Trump didn’t speak with a wink and a nod. There was no smirk. No one on his team came forward later in the day to suggest the president was just joshing. What we saw was real: the American president, desperate and afraid, publicly appealed to foreign countries to do his re-election campaign a favor – again.

Trump could’ve walked it back, and suggested this was all just a joke that journalists failed to understand, but he instead published a follow-up missive claiming an “absolute right” to pressure foreign governments to target those he deems corrupt.

It was a deliberate scheme, planned out in some detail, involving presidential orders to a variety of people, including officials within his administration.

The scandal surrounding this plan grew more serious last week when Americans saw Trump, desperate and afraid of losing, publicly appeal to foreign countries to do his re-election campaign a favor – again.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said the president’s appeal wasn’t “real,” because Trump was kidding. The Florida senator added that the president was simply “needling the press.” Soon after, Republicans ran with this as a talking point, with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) arguing over the weekend that Trump wasn’t “serious” about getting foreign countries to go after a domestic rival.

It was against this backdrop that there was a notable exchange during a brief presidential Q&A with reporters yesterday afternoon:

Q: Were you joking when you asked China to investigate? TRUMP: China has to do whatever they want. If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don’t want to look into it, they don’t have to. Frankly, are far as I’m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that’s great. And if they don’t want to, I think that’s great too. That’s up to China.

Or put another way, the president obviously wasn’t kidding about having Beijing pursue a baseless conspiracy regarding the Bidens.

It’s a problem for those who go out on a limb in support of Donald Trump: the Republican has a tendency to saw those limbs off, indifferent to the impact on his ostensible supporters.

In related news, there’s some question as to whether China did, in fact, provide information to Team Trump on Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. Michael Pillsbury, one of Trump’s top advisers on China, recently returned from Beijing and, as the Washington Post reported yesterday, has made some provocative comments.

“I got a quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese,” Pillsbury was quoted as telling the London-based Financial Times. Hours later, Pillsbury appeared on C-SPAN and denied having made the comment. “I haven’t spoken to the Financial Times for a month,” he said. But Demetri Sevastopulo, the FT’s Washington bureau chief, responded by making public on Twitter their Oct. 9 email exchange. It showed that Pillsbury had sent the journalist an email reading: “Actually I got a quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese.”

Under the circumstances, it’s hard to say with confidence what, if anything, Pillsbury received from Beijing. That said, these developments aren’t doing any favors for Rubio, Jordan, Blunt, and the “it was all just a big joke” contingent."

While there are some legitimate concerns that can be raised about Medicare-for-All on the merits—as opposed to on the politics—I am not convinced that it’s a problem that some people, like members of organized labor, have worked hard to negotiate good private health care plans. To me, this is a bit like arguing that we don’t need to eliminate Lyme disease because we can treat it with antibiotics. There is simply no value-added by having a profit or commercial basis to health insurance. If it is to exist at all, it should be strictly as a supplemental product.

But that’s an ideological opinion of mine and not a strategic analysis of what the Democrats should be pursuing on the health care front during the 2020 campaign. Watching the CNN debate on Tuesday night, I agreed with Warren and Sanders on the merits, but I thought the moderates had the better argument.

I have three concerns about pushing for Medicare-for-All right now. The first is that it’s obviously controversial and has big political vulnerabilities. Sanders freely admits that to pay for it will require taxes to go up on everybody who pays taxes, including the middle class. Warren is more reluctant to acknowledge this, although she doesn’t outright deny it. What they both argue, instead, is that overall costs will go down for the middle class because they will no longer have to pay premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs. This is most likely true in a general sense, although on an individual basis it might depend on how much health care someone uses in a given year. So, one problem lies in convincing people that a tax hike will benefit them, especially when it is not guaranteed that it will.

Another problem is the same one we see anytime health care reforms are proposed. People freak out about losing plans or access to doctors they like or having to wait in a queue to get treatment. This vulnerability isn’t avoidable or a good argument for not pursuing reforms but it does make it risky to propose something as disruptive as the abolishment of all private insurance. For me, this means that you should never propose something like this unless you’re serious about putting all your muscle behind it. And that gets to my third concern.

There is a basic cost-benefit error here. The chances of pushing a Medicare-for-All plan through the next Congress are almost nil. The Democrats would either have to overcome a Senate filibuster or they’d have to eliminate the legislative filibuster altogether. Let’s examine both of those scenarios.

The Democrats would need 60 votes to end a filibuster and they couldn’t get that many votes even if they won every competitive or semi-competitive Senate race next year. So, we can rule this out.

To end the legislative filibuster, they’d need 50 votes and the vice-president breaking a tie. But the Democrats will be lucky to have more than 51 or 52 seats even in a total landslide election. The problem here is that they’re unlikely to have enough unanimity in their caucus to end the legislative filibuster unless they can get closer to 55-57 seats. That’s both because senators are institutionally opposed to the change and because moderates get two valuable things out of the filibuster. First, it prevents radical legislation from passing which would endanger their political careers. Second, it puts them in the strongest negotiating position because they are the ones who can cut deals with Republicans (or so they like to think).

So, it’s not likely that the legislative filibuster will be eliminated by the next Congress. If it is, it will probably be after the first and most important year when even the moderates have to acknowledge that the rule is crippling their new president.

So, on a cost-benefit basis, there are easily identifiable downsides to proposing something that makes people apprehensive and that can be easily attacked and mischaracterized. What I can’t find is the upside. Where is the benefit in proposing something you won’t be able to enact?

And it’s not just the filibuster that makes it hard to enact. It’s also the lack of unanimity about it in the Democratic caucuses. I’m not at all certain that Nancy Pelosi could pass Medicare-for-All through the House. In the Senate, there could be a dozen or more Democratic senators who would never sign off on it. If the idea is to move the Overton Window to make Medicare-for-All more popular, that’s the job of a message candidate, not a candidate who plans on being the nominee.

This lack of unanimity was definitely on display during the debate last night when candidates like Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar all attacked Warren for proposing Medicare-for-All. That footage will be manna from heaven for Donald Trump or whoever runs in his stead next year. We can be angry about Democrats echoing Republican talking points, undermining support for Medicare-for-All, prattling about budget deficits, and giving ammunition to the GOP for the 2020 campaign. But we can also be angry that we have serious potential nominees who couldn’t predict these problems and avoid them.

What’s particularly annoying is that if Sanders or Warren were to become president, they’d probably struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying. That’s the best they could hope to do, and they’d be exceeding my expectations if they succeeded. So, all this is is a big fat political weakness that has no discernible upside at all.

And I simply can’t understand why anyone would gift a person like Donald Trump something he can grab and beat them with. It’s dumb politics and for once the moderates have the better side of an argument."
798,Martin Longman,,"In what looks increasingly like a two-person race, the first in the nation contest in the Hawkeye State could decide everything.",2019-10-14,Google News,"Biden Holds Steady, Warren Surges, and Iowa Looms Large",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/washingtonmonthly/rss/~3/mUZwQtdBIhk/,"Gage Skidmore/Flickr

I think Nate Silver makes a good point when he says that there are some candidates in the contest for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination who are doing better than expectations but only Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are actually doing well. They’re really the only ones who can be satisfied that they’re meeting their own expectations for progress. We’re almost to the point that we can begin to think of this as a two-person race.

In looking at national polls pre- and post-September 23 (the date Silver uses as the beginning of the impeachment process), there are a few interesting observations we can make. The first is that Biden is actually slightly up despite having his name dragged through the mud. It would probably be fairer to say that he’s holding steady, but there’s no sign in erosion. This appears to be the case for most of the candidates, too, as the majority of them, like Biden, are up or down less than a point.

But that doesn’t mean the polls have been static. Elizabeth Warren has gained a substantial 5.7 percent and is now nearing parity with Biden. Almost all of her gains appear to have come from Kamala Harris (down 2.6 percent), Cory Booker (down 1.3 percent) and Bernie Sanders (down 1.1 percent).

Sanders is actually weathering the fallout from his heart attack surprisingly well, but his campaign has been losing slow and steady ground to Warren for a couple of months now. He’s now looking like a second tier candidate, albeit the only second tier candidate in the race. The real news here is that Kamala Harris has fallen to 4.7 percent in the national polls. This appears to be fatal to her campaign hopes, as she really need to move upward into the teens to sustain a serious operation.

I suspect Harris doesn’t have much time to right her ship, but there is one small hopeful sign. She’s seems to have lost the battle with Warren for voters who were undecided between the two of them, but she’s also the logical landing point for these voters if Warren’s campaign badly falters in the coming months. I think her model was more reliant on Biden faltering so she could pick up some fleeing moderates, but at this point I think she’d need both Warren and Biden to collapse to get back into contention.

National polls only tell part of the story, of course. In Iowa, Warren has led in two of three recent polls and Sanders remains very much in the running. In New Hampshire, Warren had led in all three of the most recent polls and Sanders has slipped into a distant third place. Yet, Biden enjoys a narrow lead in Nevada (where Bernie Sanders looks competitive) and a massive lead in South Carolina.

Since there’s an advantage to winning the earliest contests, I think Warren looks like she’s in the best position right now. But she doesn’t have Iowa locked down by an means (RCP Avg. Warren 22.7, Biden 19.3, Sanders 16.0).

For both Biden and Sanders, it would be a very bad development if Warren were to win Iowa because it would probably solidify her advantage in New Hampshire and give her a sweep of the first two contests. Sanders would be effectively knocked out, I think, because it will kill his chances in Nevada and any chance of coming in second place in South Carolina. Biden is in a better position to recover from losing the first two (or even three) battles because of his strong lead in South Carolina. If he were to lose in Iowa and New Hampshire (and perhaps Nevada as well), I’m not sure that his lead in the Palmetto State would hold up, and it certainly would narrow.

While Sanders probably needs to win Iowa in order to survive, Biden would be in a decent position losing there provided that the winner were anybody other than Warren.

I suppose there is still plenty of time for the top three candidates to stumble or for a lower tier candidate to catch fire, but the eventual dynamics of the race seems to be coming into view. Iowa looks huge. As I wrote back on September 19, Kamala Harris has put all her chips on Iowa, so it will be decisive for her campaign. That appears to be the case for Sanders, too. Warren will be sitting pretty if she wins the Hawkeye State but in much more of a dogfight if she does not. And Biden really needs to avoid an outcome where Warren carries the first two states.

This is a very stupid way to decide a nomination. I’ve written that the Iowa caucuses are a fraud and should be doomed. It’s a subject that I will no doubt return to many times before Iowan Democrats turn out in the cold next winter to decide the fate of the country.

For now, I’ll just remind you of what happened in Iowa in 2012.

…an initial and preliminary count of the votes indicated that Mitt Romney had won the caucuses by eight votes. And that is how the media reported it. Yes, Rick Santorum had come out of nowhere to finish a shockingly strong second place, but he hadn’t won anything. Romney, who had suffered the indignity of lagging behind in the polls (at one time or another) to everyone in the race except Santorum, had managed to right his ship and avoid a bad stumble out of the gate. This was hugely helpful to him as the contest moved to Romney’s home turf in New Hampshire. Remember, not only had he served as governor in neighboring Massachusetts, but he owned a home in New Hampshire. Two weeks later, however, and after Romney romped to victory in the Granite State, the Iowa Republican Party had to make two embarrassing announcements. The first was that they had finalized counting the votes and that it turned out that Rick Santorum didn’t have an eight vote deficit but instead a 34-vote lead. The second announcement was that it was impossible to actually declare a winner [because results from eight of 1,774 precincts could not be located for certification] …In 2012, Iowa had 28 delegates at the convention, and according to the New York Times, Ron Paul got 22 of them, Romney got five, and Rick Santorum got zero. One vote is listed as undetermined but probably went for Romney… …you can justifiably say that Santorum won Iowa because he had the most votes in the certified count, or that Romney won because he benefited the most from the result, or that Ron Paul won because he actually got almost all the delegates, or that no one won because the party refused to declare a winner.

The Democratic caucuses operate with slightly different rules in Iowa, but it remains a beauty contest where the delegates are not decided or committed to any candidate regardless of results. It literally does not matter who wins in determining how the delegates will be awarded. Yet, the perception that someone won has a gigantic impact on the media coverage, and next year this looks to be truer and more consequential than ever."

First, the president looks for allies who’ll defend him without regard for his culpability. Second, he looks for fixers who’ll help make the problem go away.

And third, he looks for a fall guy.

President Donald Trump told House Republicans Friday that he was urged by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to make the midsummer phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is now at the center of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News. Trump suggested it was a call he didn’t even want to make, the sources said.

According to Axios’ report, the president told GOP lawmakers, “Not a lot of people know this but, I didn’t even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to.” Another source said Trump added, in reference to Perry, “[M]ore of this will be coming out in the next few days.”

At a certain level, this is pretty amusing: Trump believes his call with Zelensky was perfect, appropriate, innocent, above board in every way, and should definitely be blamed on his Energy secretary.

But that’s just the start of the problem. It’s likely that Perry was among the administration officials who encouraged the president to reach out to his Ukrainian counterpart, but there’s nothing to suggest the Texas Republican told Trump to use the phone meeting to coerce Zelensky into helping Trump’s re-election campaign.

Even if Perry wrote the script for Trump – a bizarre idea, to be sure – it’s not as if the president can credibly argue, “I only committed impeachable acts because my subordinate recommended it.”

But given everything we know, even that’s overly generous. We know from the call summary released by the White House that Perry’s name did not come up during the Trump/Zelensky discussion, and the American president made no effort to bring up energy-related issues. Trump’s effort to leverage campaign aid from Ukraine wasn’t Perry’s idea; it was Trump’s.

But I was also interested in the idea that more information related to Perry and the scandal will be “coming out in the next few days.” Is that so.

The day after Trump’s comments to House Republicans, Politico published this report:

Energy Secretary Rick Perry urged Ukraine’s president to root out corruption and pushed the new government for changes at its state-run oil and gas company, people familiar with his work said Friday – indications that he was more deeply involved than previously known in President Donald Trump’s efforts to pressure officials in Kiev. The people said they have no indication that Perry explicitly called on Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the issue that has spawned a House impeachment inquiry into Trump. But at the very least, they said, Perry played an active role in the Trump administration’s efforts to shape decisions by the newly elected government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Among other changes, Perry pushed for Ukraine’s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz to expand its board to include Americans, two people familiar with the matter said. Two longtime energy executives based in Perry’s home state of Texas were among those under consideration for that role, one source familiar with the administration’s dealings with the company said.

What’s more, as Rachel noted on Friday night’s show, when lawmakers leading the impeachment inquiry demanded materials from Vice President Mike Pence last week, they also sought documents related to Perry and meetings the Energy secretary attended.

On Thursday, Politico also reported that Perry is expected to resign next month. That report came the day after the Energy secretary expressed a willingness to cooperate with congressional investigations."

The deflections. The nonsense. Donald Trump believes he can pressure a foreign nation to help him politically. It’s his ‘right.’ Every Republican in Congress has to decide: Is he right?”

As bottom-line questions go, this seems quite fair. Obviously, the broader scandal is multifaceted, with a series of players and detailed developments, but the core of the story is simple: the American president used his office to pressure foreign governments, not to advance our interests, but to advance his. Trump fears a domestic rival, so he encouraged foreign officials to go after him.

The Republican defended himself by insisting he has an “absolute right” to engage in this conduct. The question – by some measures, the only question – is whether his party agrees with this assessment.

It’s also a question many in the GOP don’t know how to answer. Take Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), for example, who was repeatedly pressed by a CNN reporter this week to say whether it’s appropriate or not for a president to solicit campaign assistance from a foreign power. Iowa Starting Line reported yesterday on the exchange:

Ernst’s first response to the reporter’s question was: “I think we are going to have to go back, just as I said last week, we’ll have to wait. All that information is going to have to go to Senate Intelligence.” […] The reporter clarified she wanted to know whether asking a foreign power for help investigating an opponent was appropriate. “We again, we don’t have the facts in front of us,” Ernst said. “And what we see pushed out through the media, we don’t know what is accurate at this point.” The reporter interjected that she “didn’t ask if it was accurate – I’m asking you if it’s appropriate for a president to ask a foreign power to investigate his domestic political rival. Yes or no?” Ernst replied: “I don’t know if we have that information in front of us, and I’ll just stick with what I said all along … “

Ernst’s refusal to answer the question made for a cringe-worthy display. The fact that she kept saying she didn’t have information on the subject made matters worse, given the fact that Trump stood on the South Lawn of the White House and literally called for foreign governments to target Joe Biden.

To be sure, the far-right Iowan isn’t the only Republican who seems unable to answer the question. By one account, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) was asked yesterday about Trump’s foreign outreach. “I’m going to leave it to the president to make that decision,” Tillis replied.

I didn’t see the full context of the quote, but it sounds as if the North Carolina senator – up for re-election next year – believes it should be up to Trump to decide on his own whether to seek foreign intervention in the American campaign.

And all things considered, that’s hardly a better answer than Ernst’s.

The question isn’t going away, so GOP officials should take this opportunity to try to prepare some coherent answers. Either Donald Trump can pressure foreign officials to help his political campaign or he can’t. Either Republicans are comfortable with their party’s president’s actions or they’re not."

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) was willing to do what most Republicans were not: he admonished his party’s president. “By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,” the senator wrote on Twitter.

The predictable Trump tantrum soon followed.

Trump claimed in one tweet Saturday that he had heard that there are people in Utah who regretted voting for Romney, who won an open Utah seat for U.S. Senate in 2018 with nearly 63 percent of the vote. Prior to the general election, he won the Republican primary by nearly 40 points. […] Trump on Saturday appeared to call for Romney’s impeachment as senator, using a hashtag in all capital letters. “He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats,” Trump tweeted…. Trump began his attacks on Romney earlier on Saturday with tweets in which he called Romney “a pompous ‘ass’ who has been fighting me from the beginning” and said Romney could have won the 2012 election if he “worked this hard on Obama.”

Incidentally, a higher percentage of the electorate voted for Romney in 2012 than voted for Trump in 2016. It’s also worth noting that there is no mechanism in American law that allows for the impeachment of a sitting U.S. senator – a detail Trump might know if he had a stronger familiarity with the basics of his own country’s system of government.

Nevertheless, the Washington Post noted that the president’s online fury sent “a flashing signal to other Republicans that there would be consequences to speaking out against the president.”

That’s almost certainly true, but it’s worth pausing to consider the severity of the “flashing signal.” Beware, congressional Republicans, you too may be subjected to some rude tweets for a couple of days if you take a principled stand?

I don’t imagine it’s pleasant to be on the receiving end of a presidential fit, but it’s not as if Trump’s rant did any meaningful harm to Romney. So where’s the disincentive for others in the GOP?

On Saturday morning, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was willing to tell reporters, “I thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. It’s completely inappropriate.” A day earlier, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) was careful not to criticize Trump by name, but he did say in a statement, “Hold up: Americans don’t look to Chinese commies for the truth.”

At least for now, the president hasn’t gone after either of them for daring to say something the White House may not like. Even if Trump took great offense, I have a hunch Collins and Sasse could survive a few intemperate tweets.

The Washington Post had a separate report over the weekend on the widespread panic in Republican circles, filled with GOP officials who fear drastic consequences if they step out of line. One former senior administration official said Republicans are largely united behind Trump because “nobody wants to be the zebra that strays from the pack and gets gobbled up by the lion.”

Perhaps, but what if the lion has no bite and his roar isn’t nearly as intimidating as he likes to believe?

The article added:

Across the country, most GOP lawmakers have responded to questions about Trump’s conduct with varying degrees of silence, shrugged shoulders or pained defenses. For now, their collective strategy is simply to survive and not make any sudden moves. This account of the anxiety gripping the Republican Party is based on interviews with 21 lawmakers, aides and advisers, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly.

By any fair measure, it’s pitiful to see so many Republicans this terrified of a flailing and unpopular president as he approaches impeachment. But the dynamic is made more acute after reading Trump’s politically impotent tweets directed at Mitt Romney.

If the worst arrows in the presidential quiver feature juvenile taunts and threat of a procedural tactic that does not exist, GOP officials need not cower in the corner indefinitely."

On the contrary, he’s a career diplomat, who’s worked for Democratic and Republican administrations, including serving as an ambassador under Bill Clinton and an undersecretary of State under George W. Bush.

With this in mind, it was notable to see Burns express public disgust yesterday after Donald Trump publicly urged China to go after Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign (and during delicate trade negotiations between the United States and China).

“This is a first in American history dating to 1789,” Burns wrote on Twitter. “An American President has asked our strongest adversary, a communist dictatorship, to investigate his major opponent. Let that sink in. It is corruption – morally and legally wrong.”

The criticism was itself notable, though I was especially interested in his historical reference. The word “unprecedented” is probably used a bit too often, and some political observers fail to fully appreciate just how frequently history rhymes. But in this case, Burns’ take wasn’t hyperbolic: these circumstances are unique.

CNN published a piece this week from four historians – Texas A&M’s Elizabeth A. Cobbs, Arizona State’s Kyle Longley, Colorado School of Mines’ Kenneth Osgood, and the University of Texas at Austin’s Jeremi Suri – who agreed they’ve “never seen anything like” this Trump scandal.

In our numerous books on presidents from George Washington to Barack Obama, we have examined how American leaders conduct US foreign policy – the good, bad, and ugly. Nothing really surprises us anymore. Until now. Trump’s documentary record differs dramatically from his predecessors. A worrisome thread runs through each conversation. Trump appears laser-focused on his own fortunes to the exclusion of the national security of the United States. Unfortunately, this is part of a larger and startling pattern of Trump promoting his personal agenda ahead of the nation’s interests.

It’s worth emphasizing for context that the historians’ piece was published on Wednesday – the day before Trump stood on the White House’s South Lawn and publicly urged two foreign governments to go after one of his domestic political rivals.

In general, there’s a temptation to look to history for comparable examples, and then extrapolate from there. What did Americans do the last time we addressed circumstances like these? What was effective? How did honorable officials respond and how best can contemporary officials follow their example?

Trump, however, is blazing a uniquely pernicious path, leaving us without a historical map to follow."

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns. Biden now has five endorsements from sitting U.S. senators, more than any other Democratic candidate."

As the scandal has unfolded, an obvious quid pro quo has come into focus: Ukraine needed military aid; Trump wanted something he could use to defeat Joe Biden; and the Republican hoped to trade one for the other.

Recently disclosed text messages showed Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador in Ukraine, asking U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, “Are we now saying that security assistance and [a White House] meeting are conditioned on investigations?” In a subsequent message, Taylor added, “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.”

But while Americans continue to learn new details about the scandal, let’s not overlook what’s happening at the same time in Kiev. The Wall Street Journal reported late last week:

Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said Friday it is reviewing past investigations into the owner of a gas company linked to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden’s son, raising the possibility of restarting probes amid pressure from President Trump. For the past several months, the Trump White House has pushed the authorities in Kyiv to investigate Burisma Group, a big gas-production company, and the role there of Hunter Biden, who served on its board, along with actions of Mr. Biden when he was overseeing U.S. policy toward Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported yesterday:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says his country will “happily” investigate whether Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections. Zelenskiy told reporters Thursday that “we can’t say yes or no” as to whether there was any interference without an investigation. He said it’s in Ukraine’s interest to determine what happened.

The Ukrainian president also insisted yesterday that Trump didn’t try to “blackmail” him.

Or put another way, Ukraine now appears to be saying and doing what Donald Trump wanted Ukraine to say and do.

At a distance, it seems as if the quid is suddenly meeting the quo."

It’s therefore a bit ironic to hear the Republican make a spirited case that his efforts to coerce foreign governments to help his re-election campaign are really just an extension of a sincere anti-corruption crusade.

It’s clear Trump has settled on this as his principal talking point, as evidenced by this morning’s tweet.

“As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!”

During a brief Q&A with reporters this morning, the Republican stuck to the phrasing with almost comical repetition, as if he’d been led to believe the words are a magical elixir that will make his scandals go away.

The pitch is so fanciful, it’s almost insulting. Americans are genuinely supposed to believe that Trump and his GOP cohorts, indifferent to Joe Biden’s work in Ukraine for several years, suddenly decided the former vice president is guilty of serious wrongdoing, evidence be damned. Trump and his allies came to this realization quite suddenly, and it occurred to them – coincidentally, of course – right around the time polls showed Biden leading the president in national polling by double digits.

The Republican, according to the White House’s preferred narrative, isn’t concerned at all with Biden’s 2020 bid. Heaven forbid. Trump, his own corruption notwithstanding, simply feels an obligation to root out corruption wherever he finds it. By this reasoning, our beleaguered president is actually something akin to a hero, putting electoral considerations aside in a quest for good government around the globe.

If members of Team Trump believe such a laughable story is going to derail the impeachment process, they’re likely to be disappointed.

In fact, the house of cards seemed to collapse quite suddenly this morning, when a White House reporter had the good sense to ask a question the president didn’t see coming.

CNBC’s Eamon Javers asked Trump if he’s ever sought a corruption investigation from foreign leaders targeting someone who isn’t one of his political opponents.

“You know, we would have to look,” the president said, apparently unable to think of a comparable example.

Let me save the White House staff some trouble: international corruption has never been a subject of interest to Trump. As the Washington Post reported on Monday, “A search through Trump’s past comments on corruption shows he has rarely raised concerns about corruption in foreign countries – except when it suited his political purposes.”

Imagine that."

John Kennedy (R-La.) issued a notable press announcement yesterday morning.

[Kennedy] announced today that he will file legislation after recess to ban the immediate family members of senior U.S. political officials from profiting in Ukraine. Specifically, his bill will ban an immediate family member of a member of the Senate, the House, the president’s cabinet, the vice president and/or the president from serving as a consultant, employee, independent contractor or board member for or owning 5% or more in any entity doing business in or with Ukraine. Immediate family members include parents, siblings and children.

How extraordinarily specific. The Louisiana Republican isn’t concerned about officials’ family members doing private-sector work in any other country except Ukraine.

There’s no great mystery as to what’s behind this little stunt: Kennedy is playing a game by crafting legislation intended to jab former Vice President Joe Biden. The senator isn’t concerned about officials’ family members profiting from foreign work in general – Kennedy hasn’t unveiled legislation, for example, that might affect Donald Trump’s adult children and the enterprise that the president still profits from – but the GOP lawmaker is focused on making some kind of partisan point about a leading Democratic presidential candidate.

As CNN’s Jake Tapper reminded Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) the other day, “Either there’s a principle that people should not benefit from their connections, or there isn’t.” For members of Congress like Kennedy, the principle only applies to Democratic families, which obviously makes it difficult to take his partisan games seriously.

But therein lies the rub: the presidential impeachment process is a fundamentally serious process, and too many members of Trump’s party are focused on juvenile antics.

There’s been some discussion this week about how best to make presidential impeachment a bipartisan effort. Elizabeth Drew, a journalistic veteran of many White House scandals, wrote a piece for the New York Times yesterday with a headline that read, “How to Win Republican Support for Impeachment.” She encouraged Democrats to move slowly and broaden the scope of the inquiry.

Similarly, Megan McArdle had a piece in the Washington Post today, urging Democrats to “make it as easy as possible for conservatives to join the effort” to remove Trump from office.

But as much as I’d love to believe that GOP lawmakers are prepared to consider the allegations on the merits, and will maintain an open mind about the scope of Trump’s obvious wrongdoing, Kennedy’s Ukraine stunt is emblematic of a larger truth: Republicans are not prepared to deal with this crisis responsibly.

There are a variety of possible explanations. Maybe GOP lawmakers are afraid of Trump’s rabid base of followers. Perhaps they’re unwilling to deal with negative Fox News coverage. Maybe knee-jerk partisanship is overriding any sense of judgment.

But whatever the reason, those hoping to see Republicans deal with Trump’s impeachment in a mature and measured way are likely to be disappointed. Just ask John Kennedy."

One message showed Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador in Ukraine, asking U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, “Are we now saying that security assistance and [a White House] meeting are conditioned on investigations?”

In a subsequent message, Taylor added, “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.”

Nearly five hours after that text was sent, Sondland – a Republican megadonor with no experience in diplomacy or foreign policy – replied, “Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo’s of any kind.”

It was a difficult message to accept at face value, since common sense suggests it was written as a cover story. But for the White House, Sondland’s text effectively negates the controversy. As the story goes, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, tackling policy in Ukraine for reasons unknown, exonerated his boss with his online message.

Except, it’s not quite that simple, as Sondland is poised to tell lawmakers when he appears on Capitol Hill this week.

U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will testify to Congress [on Thursday] that he did not know why United States military assistance to Ukraine was held up nor who ordered it, according to a person with knowledge of Sondland’s testimony before the House next week. Sondland will say that he “relied on the president’s assurances in good faith and passed these along” when he texted Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor that there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine, the person said. President Donald Trump has urged Ukraine to investigate the son of political rival Joe Biden.

To put this in some rough chronological order, Bill Taylor, a career official, effectively told Sondland, “This sure seems wrong.” At that point, Sondland talked to Trump, and the president effectively said, “I’m not doing anything wrong,” which Sondland then texted back to Taylor.

The trouble, we now know, is that Sondland was simply taking Trump’s word for it – and given the president’s capacity for staggering dishonesty, and everything we now know about this scandal, that was probably unwise.

Sondland didn’t have independent knowledge about whether there was a quid pro quo or not; he simply had the president’s unreliable claims to go on. The ambassador didn’t even know whether Trump’s denial was true; Sondland was simply playing the role of messenger.

Why does that matter? Because for Trump and his allies, Sondland’s text about the president’s “crystal clear” intentions is a central pillar of the White House’s entire defense. If the reporting from the weekend proves true, Sondland will knock that pillar down during his testimony this week.

What’s more, the Washington Post reported, “Sondland is expected to say that for months before the Sept. 9 message, he worked at the direction of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, to secure what he would call in another text message the ‘deliverable’ sought by Trump: a public statement from Ukraine that it would investigate corruption, including mentioning Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, by name. In exchange for the statement, the president would grant Ukraine’s new president a coveted White House audience.”

Last week, the Trump administration scrambled to block Sondland’s testimony. Suddenly, we have a pretty good sense of the motivations behind that decision."

Close video Pence, at center of Trump Ukraine scheme, scrambles for cover Rachel Maddow shares reporting from the Washington Post that Donald Trump made Mike Pence the middle man in his scheme to manipulate the president of Ukraine, leaving Pence scrambling to explain how he wouldn’t have been aware of the role he was playing. share tweet email save Embed

President Trump repeatedly involved Vice President Pence in efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine at a time when the president was using other channels to solicit information that he hoped would be damaging to a Democratic rival, current and former U.S. officials said. Trump instructed Pence not to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in May — an event White House officials had pushed to put on the vice president’s calendar — when Ukraine’s new leader was seeking recognition and support from Washington, the officials said. Months later, the president used Pence to tell Zelensky that U.S. aid was still being withheld while demanding more aggressive action on corruption, officials said. At that time — following Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy — the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

But don’t forget about Vice President Mike Pence. The Washington Post reported overnight:

The timeline of events paints an exceedingly unflattering picture. We know that Trump personally intervened to delay U.S. aid to Ukraine, which was desperate for the American assistance. We also know that Trump soon after had a telephone meeting with Zelenksy in which the Ukrainian leader stressed the significance of the aid package, only to hear his American counterpart say in response, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.”

Trump’s wish list included, among other things, Ukraine taking law-enforcement action to undermine Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election.

We now also know that in the wake of that conversation, it was Mike Pence who spoke with Zelenksy in person, reiterating Trump’s expectations.

That’s not a great position for the vice president to find himself in. Trump’s actions are likely to lead to his impeachment, and it now appears Pence may have done something quite similar.

One of the most striking things about the Washington Post’s report on this isn’t just the top-line revelation, but also the behind-the-scenes drama – because reading the article, it seems clear that there are factions inside the White House, one of which is eager to drag Pence into this mess, and one of which is scrambling to keep the vice president out of it.

The trouble with the defense from Team Pence is how underwhelming it is.

The Post article noted, for example, that officials close to the vice president “insist that he was unaware of Trump’s efforts to press Zelensky for damaging information about Biden and his son.” Or put another way, Pence told the Ukrainian leader that U.S. aid was on hold, and Pence pressed Zelensky about “corruption” concerns, but the Indiana Republican didn’t fully understand the big picture.

There are problems with the defense. A top member of Pence’s team, for example, was on the Trump/Zelensky call. Pence also had access to the transcript of that call soon after it took place. The Post also reported, “White House officials said that Pence probably would have received the detailed notes of the president’s call in his briefing book on July 26,” the day after the phone meeting.

What’s more, the detailed call summary was likely part of the briefing materials Pence received before his in-person meeting with the Ukrainian president. The article added, “Officials close to Pence contend that he traveled to Warsaw for a meeting with Zelensky on Sept. 1 probably without having read — or at least fully registered — the transcript of Trump’s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine.”

I did appreciate the use of the word “registered” – as if Pence saw the document showing Trump pressing Zelensky on Biden, but the vice president didn’t fully get it.

Team Pence will have to do better than this."

CBS News’ Scott Pelley presented the Republican leader with basic factual information: Trump told the Ukrainian president, in the context of military aid, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.”

McCarthy was incredulous and accused the journalist of adding a word to the quote. Pelley explained that he was simply reading the text from the official White House call summary. The GOP leader asked, in reference to Trump, “He said, ‘I’d like you to do a favor, though’ ”? The interviewer replied, “Yes, it’s in the White House transcript.”

It was a humiliating exchange for McCarthy, who apparently hadn’t read the document he was there to defend, but it was also a tacit acknowledgement of wrongdoing: the Republican congressman seemed to suggest that if Trump has said, “I would like you to do us a favor, though,” it’d be an inherently problematic thing for a president to have said.

A few days later, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), one of the president’s most sycophantic supporters, told the Washington Examiner, “If a president just randomly was parachuting his personal attorney down into countries where he thought he could get some dirt on political opponents … that might be questionable. That’s not what this is.”

Actually, that was a decent summary of what Trump did with Rudy Giuliani, dispatching him to Ukraine to dig up dirt the Republican president could use.

All of which leads us to yesterday’s Sunday shows, where viewers heard Trump supporters make the case that the president was kidding when he publicly urged China to go after Joe Biden. Consider this exchange between ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio):

STEPHANOPOULOS: Threshold question=: Do you think it’s appropriate for President Trump to ask China and Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden? JORDAN: George, you really think he was serious about thinking that China’s going to investigate the Biden family? … I don’t think anyone in America really believes – except people maybe in the press and some Democrats in Congress really believe – that the president of the United States thinks China is going to investigate.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) made similar comments around the same time. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also pushed the humor-related talking point on Friday.

At this point, we could talk about the fact that Trump clearly wasn’t kidding with his appeal to China. We could also talk about how the president echoed his very serious appeal to Beijing on Twitter, and by some accounts, he brought up the matter directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a phone meeting over the summer.

We could also point out that China took the appeal seriously, and several Republican senators have been willing to denounce Trump’s appeal.

But as important as these details are, there’s a common thread tying together McCarthy’s, Nunes’, and Jordan’s unpersuasive talking points: they’re all tacitly acknowledging presidential wrongdoing.

McCarthy’s defense made it sound as if it’d be problematic if Trump told the Ukrainian president, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” Nunes’ defense made it sound as if it’d be problematic if Trump dispatched a private attorney to dig up dirt on an American rival. And the “just kidding” argument peddled by Jordan, Blunt, and Rubio implicitly concedes that an American president shouldn’t appeal to Beijing for campaign aid.

And therein lies the rub: Trump did all of these things. He told Zelensky, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” He parachuted Rudy Giuliani into Kiev. He stood on the South Lawn of the White House and appealed to China to investigate Biden.

Trump’s diehard allies keep pushing arguments that tacitly concede presidential misconduct.

Maybe if the White House could come up with a credible defense, Trump’s friends might have something compelling to peddle during media interviews, but for now, they’re making stuff up as they go along, and they’re not doing an especially good job."

About a year ago, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared at a forum and was asked why he and Donald Trump struggled to see eye to eye. The nation’s former chief diplomat talked a bit about the differences in their styles before noting, almost in passing, that the president had asked him to do things that “ violate the law .”

It was, of course, a startling moment, though the former cabinet secretary didn’t go into additional details about the kind of illegalities Trump wanted him to commit. As Rachel noted on the show last night, however, Bloomberg News appears to have uncovered an amazing instance.

President Donald Trump pressed then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to help persuade the Justice Department to drop a criminal case against an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of Rudy Giuliani, according to three people familiar with the 2017 meeting in the Oval Office. Tillerson refused, arguing it would constitute interference in an ongoing investigation of the trader, Reza Zarrab, according to the people. They said other participants in the Oval Office were shocked by the request. Tillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal.

As much of the country has no doubt noticed, we’re in the midst of a presidential impeachment inquiry, which is evaluating Trump’s possible high crimes and misdemeanors. With this in mind, it’s worth emphasizing that if the president urged his secretary of State to interfere with the Justice Department, derailing the prosecution of one of Giuliani’s clients – a client who faced serious criminal charges – that would almost certainly constitute an impeachable offense.

Which is to say, another impeachable offense.

The details about the Giuliani’s client are a little complex, and I’d encourage you to read the full Bloomberg report and watch last night’s segment for the relevant details. But taking a step back, I’m amazed by some of the big-picture takeaways, including the fact that Trump, for all of his posturing about being “tough” on Iran, reportedly personally tried to intervene to protect an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was accused of evading sanctions on Iran.

The American president apparently realized it’d be problematic if he contacted the Justice Department in order to stop the prosecution, so he allegedly directed Tillerson to do it for him.

For his part, Giuliani has denounced the story, though he conceded to Bloomberg News that he may have “dropped” his client’s name “in a conversation” with Trump. Asked if he spoke to Tillerson about the case, Giuliani added, “[Y[ou have no right to know that.”

There is a pattern in this White House of Donald Trump allegedly interfering in ongoing Justice Department criminal investigations. Now, there’s a brand new one.

Postscript: Colin Kahl, who worked on national security issues in the Obama/Biden White House, noted overnight that during the recent Democratic administration, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “pushed us hard” on the Zarrab case, but Obama administration officials told Turkey it wouldn’t be appropriate for the White House “to interfere in such cases.”

Things changed after Jan. 20, 2017."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) yesterday whether it’s appropriate for Donald Trump to urge foreign countries to go after one of his domestic rivals. “Look, of course not,” the Texas Republican replied. “Elections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it’s not the business of foreign countries, any foreign countries, to be interfering in our elections.”

Cruz added, “Listen, foreign countries should stay out of American elections. That’s true for Russia. That’s true for Ukraine. That’s true for China. That’s true for all of them. It should be the American people deciding elections.”

This, of course, was the correct answer. It’s also the one some of his Republican colleagues – most notably Iowa’s Joni Ernst and Colorado’s Cory Gardner – refused to offer, afraid to take a stand on principle.

But as it turns out, they aren’t the only ones struggling. After some unhelpful exchanges, CNN’s Jake Tapper yesterday asked Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), “Are you really not capable of answering a question about whether or not it’s acceptable for a president to ask a foreign rival to investigate his political rivals, to ask a foreign nation to investigate his political rivals without bringing up Hunter Biden?” Cramer wouldn’t respond directly.

But even more striking was an exchange late last week between Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Boise State Public Radio about the White House scandal.

“I’m not going there. If you want to have an interview with me about the business center, please do so,” Risch said, before turning and walking away. “Don’t do that again,” he said.

So, at a public event, a journalist isn’t supposed to ask the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about an ongoing scandal involving U.S. foreign policy? Is that the point we’ve reached?

In a written follow-up statement, Risch’s office added, “We are in a very partisan and volatile time in American politics, and the House’s impeachment inquiry has clearly enflamed these ongoing tensions. It’s unproductive to weigh in on each and every development. Rather than commenting on every new piece of information, the senator is monitoring these issues and will comment if and when impeachment proceedings move to the Senate and he has cast his official vote as a juror in those impeachment proceedings.”

To recap, the Idaho Republican believes it’s the Democratic House, and not the Republican president’s abuses of power, that have “enflamed” political tensions. Perhaps, if the House simply ignored Trump’s wrongdoing the way the GOP-led Senate does, conditions would be less “volatile.”

Risch also noted his role as a likely “juror” in impeachment proceedings, which is true, but which doesn’t prevent the Idahoan from acknowledging that seeking foreign interference in American elections is wrong.

If Ted Cruz, whom no one would call a center-left Rockefeller Republican, can endorse the unambiguous underlying principle, why can’t other GOP senators do the same?"

Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) isn’t just a random backbench member of Congress. He’s the top Republican in the U.S. House, and he’d likely be elevated to the House Speaker’s office in the event of a GOP takeover of the chamber.

The California Republican is also a close ally of Donald Trump and the White House, who’s helped take the lead in his party for defending the president against the Ukraine scandal.

It’s just not going especially well for him.

On CBS’ 60 Minutes two weeks ago, McCarthy seemed inexplicably lost when told that Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” Last week, the House Minority Leader told Fox News, “You watch what the president said, he’s not saying China should investigate.” In reality, Trump stood on the White House South Lawn, appeared in front of a significant group of journalists, and literally said, “China should start an investigation into the Bidens.”

All of which led to this morning’s press briefing with the House Republican leadership.

Q: I hear all of you attacking the impeachment process but none of you defending the president’s actions. Do any of you think it was okay for the president to ask more than one foreign nation to investigate his campaign rival? McCARTHY: The president wasn’t investigating a campaign rival. What the president was trying to get to the bottom, just as every American would want to know, why did we go through two years?

The Republican leader went on to describe the Russia scandal as a “hoax,” again in defiance of reality, suggesting that Trump’s focus has been retrospective, not focused on Biden.

I honestly don’t understand what it is that Kevin McCarthy doesn’t understand.

It’s been nearly a month since the White House released an official call summary of Trump’s July 25 conversation with Zelensky, in which the American president was quoted saying, “[T]here’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with [Attorney General Bill Barr] would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

A week after that call summary was released to the public, Trump stood on the South Lawn of the White House and told reporters on camera, “China should start an investigation into the Bidens.” The Republican added soon after, “I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.”

With this in mind, when McCarthy says the president wasn’t pursuing an investigation into a domestic political rival, did he just miss these developments? Is he hoping that we missed them? Did he not understand what Trump very clearly said?

While we wait for those answers to come into focus, there’s also the larger issue of Republicans continuing to struggle with the root question: is it all right for a president to solicit campaign assistance from a foreign power? Some in the party – most notably Iowa’s Joni Ernst and Colorado’s Cory Gardner – have struggled to dodge the question, while Texas’ Ted Cruz actually answered it well.

Leave it to Kevin McCarthy, however, to pretend Trump didn’t say what everyone else heard him say."
818,Steve Benen,"It’s been four days since Donald Trump publicly called on China and Ukraine to go after Joe Biden, and the president’s Republican allies still aren’t sure what to say about it.

Some argue he was kidding – an absurd claim, under the circumstances – while a few in the GOP have been willing to make their dissatisfaction known. Most in the party have been content to hide and say nothing.

But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blazed his own trail, making an argument no one else has been willing to make. TPM reported:

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) made a befuddling claim on “Fox and Friends” Monday morning, arguing that President Trump actually didn’t tell China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden on live-television. […] During an interview on “Fox and Friends” McCarthy was asked about the emerging talking point among Republicans — that Trump was clearly just joking or trolling China when he asked the country to probe his political opponent. McCarthy not only didn’t respond to whether the move was just a joke, he argued that Trump’s “not saying China should investigate.” “You watch what the President said, he’s not saying China should investigate,” McCarthy said.

There are some elements of any political scandal that involve judgment calls and matters of subjectivity, but this isn’t one of them. Four days ago, Donald Trump stood on the White House South Lawn, appeared in front of a significant group of journalists, and said, “China should start an investigation into the Bidens.”

I suppose it’s possible some very creative person in the House GOP leadership might make the case that there’s an ever-so-subtle difference between “China should investigate” and “China should start an investigation,” but I’m comfortable concluding that no fair-minded observer would ever take such an argument seriously.

What we’re left with is an example of Kevin McCarthy, desperate to shield Trump from accountability, failing to familiarize himself with the most basic elements of a scandal – for the second time in eight days.

As regular readers know, the House Republican leader appeared on 60 Minutes last weekend to defend the president against the Ukraine scandal, but McCarthy appeared lost when Scott Pelley presented him with basic factual information.

PELLEY: What do you make of this exchange? President Zelensky says, “We are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.” And President Trump replies, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” MCCARTHY: You just added another word. PELLEY: No, it’s in the transcript. MCCARTHY: He said- “I’d like you to do a favor though”? PELLEY: Yes, it’s in the White House transcript.

At the bottom of page two of the call summary, released by the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is quoted talking about how eager his country is to receive additional military support from the United States. The very next words out of the American president’s mouth, according to the document, are, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.”

McCarthy knew he was going on 60 Minutes. He knew the topic of the interview. He and his staff had time to prepare for basic questions about obvious details – such as the single most controversial phrase in the rough transcript that created a political earthquake the moment it was released. It was only 10 words; it stands to reason McCarthy would have familiarized himself with the quote before his national television appearance. But he didn’t.

A week later, the GOP leader went on Fox News. He again knew the topic of the interview, He and his staff again had time to prepare for basic questions about obvious details – such as the single most controversial phrase in a Q&A that created a political earthquake the moment it was uttered. It was only eight words; it stands to reason McCarthy would have familiarized himself with the quote before his national television appearance. But once again, he didn’t.

If Vice President Mike Pence hoped to keep his distance from Donald Trump’s intensifying scandal, this week’s developments were unforgiving. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday night that the president “repeatedly involved” the Indiana Republican “in efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine.”

As we discussed, the timeline of events paints an exceedingly unflattering picture, featuring a vice president making an unpersuasive case that he was ignorant about Trump’s scheme, despite having ample access to the relevant information.

Yesterday, Pence was in Arizona, where he seemed eager to lean into the scandal, rather than distance himself from it, apparently because he no longer has much of a choice.

“I think the American people have a right to know if the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from this position as Vice President during the last administration. […] I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, when you hold the second highest office in the land, it comes with unique responsibilities – not just to be above impropriety, but to be above the appearance of impropriety. And clearly, in this case, there are legitimate questions that ought to be asked. And we’re going to continue to ask them since the American people have a right to know whether or not the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from his position.”

Pence made the comments just a month after his trip to Ireland, where he had meetings in Dublin, but stayed several hours away at a Trump-owned property on the other side of the country. The American president “suggested” Pence stay at the Republican’s hotel, indirectly helping Trump profit from the vice president’s trip.

There is, meanwhile, no evidence whatsoever of wrongdoing on Joe Biden’s part.

Echoing Trump, Pence added yesterday, “The president made it very clear that he believes our other nations around the world should look into” Biden-related allegations.

Or put another way, Pence has replaced his obliviousness posture with a more definitive embrace of Trump’s impeachable scheme.

The vice president went on to say, “Anyone that looks at the president’s transcript will see that Trump was raising issues [with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] that were appropriate, that were of genuine interest to the American people.”

I can only assume that Pence is counting on the public being so ignorant of current events that we won’t know how foolish this is."

Gavin Newsom signed 15 gun-related bills into law Friday, tightening the state's already-stringent Second Amendment restrictions.

One of the bills, which expands a so-called ""red flag"" law to allow co-workers, employers and educators to seek gun violence restraining orders against firearms owners they fear are a danger to themselves and others, was vetoed twice by Newsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown.

Newsom also signed a companion bill allowing the gun violence restraining orders to last one and five years, although the gun owners could petition to end those restrictions earlier. The bill also allows judges to issue search warrants at the same time as they grant the orders. The warrants can be used immediately if the gun owners are served with the relinquishment orders but fail to turn over the firearms or ammunition.

""California has outperformed the rest of the nation, because of our gun safety laws, in reducing the gun murder rate substantially compared to the national reduction,"" Newsom said as he signed the measures surrounded by state lawmakers. ""No state does it as well or comprehensively as the state of California, and we still have a long way to go.""

Between 1993 and 2017, the latest available, there was a 62 percent decline in the gun murder rate in California, nearly double the 34 percent nationally, Newsom said.

Co-workers who want to request a gun violence restraining order will have to have ""substantial and regular interactions"" with gun owners, and co-workers and school employees will need to get approval from their employers or school administrators before seeking a restraining order.

Those seeking the orders will be required to file sworn statements detailing their reasons for doing so.

BIDEN WANTS TO GIVE ASSAULT WEAPON OWNERS TWO OPTIONS: SELL YOUR GUNS TO THE FEDS OR REGISTER

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) opposed the bill, saying it ""poses a significant threat to civil liberties"" because a restraining order can be sought before a gun owner has an opportunity to dispute the request.

Additionally, those making a request under the new law may ""lack the relationship or skills required to make an appropriate assessment,"" the ACLU said.

The bill's author, Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco, cited a recent study finding that gun restraining order laws may have helped prevent 21 mass shootings, though the University of California, Davis, researchers cautioned that ""it is impossible to know whether violence would have occurred.""

The National Rifle Association (NRA) and its state affiliate, the California Rifle and Pistol Association, opposed the new restrictions, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The laws will take effect Jan. 1, 2020.

GAVIN NEWSOM PREDICTS THE GOP WILL DEVELOP INTO A THIRD PARTY: 'THEY ARE FINISHED'

The Democratic governor also signed a law that will limit Californians to purchasing one long rifle per month, according to The Sacramento Bee.

This law expands the current legislation that applies to handguns, and it will prevent people under 21 from purchasing semi-automatic rifles and other similar firearms.

The collective measures ""tweak"" the state's current laws and ""improve implementation,"" according to Amanda Wilcox, spokeswoman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

Ting also has a companion bill that would allow gun owners starting next September who are the subjects of restraining order requests to file a form with the court saying they won't contest the requests and are surrendering their firearms. Under current law, even those who agree to give up their guns must go through a court hearing, which Ting says wastes time and resources.

* Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders remains hospitalized, but according to his wife, the Vermont senator will not need any additional medical procedures and he expects to participate in the Democratic primary debate scheduled for Oct. 15.

* Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, which is a very impressive haul, and puts her second only to Bernie Sanders’ $25.3 million quarter. [Update: I added this item after originally publishing the round-up.]

* Reinforcing impressions that Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign sees Joe Biden as a threat, the president’s operation is launching a $1 million ad buy in early primary states, airing a new attack ad peddling a discredited conspiracy theory involving the former vice president and Ukraine.

* Speaking of Biden, the Democratic campaign announced yesterday that it raised $12.5 million in the third quarter. It’s an underwhelming haul, which is roughly half the money Sanders raised over the same three-month period.

* For his part, Biden is moving forward with a $6 million ad buy in the first four states holding 2020 nominating contests.

* At an official White House event in Florida yesterday, Trump discussed 2020 campaign strategy, went after Elizabeth Warren with his “Pocahontas” slur, and labeled Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” It served as a reminder that the president obviously has no qualms about blurring the lines of propriety ahead of 2020.

* In an increasingly common dynamic in the GOP, former Rep. Pete Sessions (R) is launching a comeback bid in a new congressional district. Sessions lost last year in Texas’ 32nd district – an area he’d represented for more than two decades – so he’s now moving to Texas’ 17th district, which will be home to an open-seat contest next year.

* A new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) with a 47% approval rating, despite his recent racial controversy. The same poll found Trump with a 39% approval rating in the commonwealth.

* And in Ohio, the latest Emerson poll shows Biden narrowly leading Sanders, 29% to 27%, with Warren not far behind with 21%. Also of note, the survey found each of the Democratic contenders leading Trump in Ohio in hypothetical general election match-ups."

Shortly before midnight, Trump highlighted an item from the Washington Examiner’s Byron York showing Biden’s lead in the Democratic race dwindling and questioning whether the former vice president should still be seen as the frontrunner for his party’s 2020 nomination. The president found this worthy of mockery.

It was a quick peek into the president’s perspective: Trump isn’t just peddling bogus corruption allegations against his would-be challenger; the Republican also considers it important to let the public know about Biden’s poll advantages relative to his 2020 rivals.

Two weeks ago, Politico reported on Trump’s “extraordinary preoccupation” with the Delaware Democrat, which led the president to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help go after Biden. It led to a follow-up report that probably didn’t receive as much attention as it probably deserved.

President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign is preparing an avalanche of TV ads targeting Joe Biden in early primary states – its most aggressive step yet to meddle in the Democratic nomination contest. Starting this weekend, the reelection effort will air over $1 million in anti-Biden commercials in Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada, according to two people familiar with the move. The spots focus on Trump’s claim that the former vice president and his son engaged in corruption in Ukraine.

It matters, of course, that Team Trump’s attacks are false. But taking a step back, it’s the circumstances that struck me as astonishing: I’m not aware of any incumbent president who’s ever made a seven-figure ad buy targeting a rival party’s candidate several months before the primaries even begin.

The same day as we learned about the $1 million anti-Biden ad campaign, Trump stood on the South Lawn of the White House and urged China and Ukraine to go after the Democratic candidate. A few days later, Trump encouraged Biden to quit the race.

There’s no modern parallel for a sitting president appearing so publicly panicked about a possible rival, at least not this early in the election cycle.

At a certain level, the anxiety is rooted in quantitative fact. CNN’s Harry Enten recently noted that he doesn’t expect Biden to be the Democratic nominee, but the political analyst added, “I’m not sure folks appreciate how unusual Biden holding a 10+ pt lead on Trump is at this point. No incumbent since at least WWII was down by anything close to that at this point.”

And that, by all appearances, drove Trump to abuse the powers of his office and open the door to his impeachment."

Vice President Mike Pence probably hoped to keep his distance from Donald Trump’s intensifying Ukraine scandal, but those efforts aren’t going especially well. The Washington Post reported last week that the president “repeatedly involved” the Indiana Republican “in efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine.”

As regular readers know, the timeline of events paints an exceedingly unflattering picture, featuring a vice president making an unpersuasive case that he was ignorant about Trump’s scheme, despite having ample access to the relevant information.

It was against this backdrop that Pence was in Iowa yesterday, where NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard asked the vice president whether he was aware the Trump administration was delaying aid to Ukraine, at least in part to get Ukraine to go after Joe Biden. Pence said several words, none of which answered the question.

So, Hillyard asked again, and Pence evaded again. In all, the video of the event showed the NBC News reporter asking the vice president four times. It wasn’t a trick question. A “yes” or a “no” would’ve sufficed.

But Pence wasn’t prepared to answer directly, instead saying he personally didn’t discuss the Bidens with Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky. Perhaps not, but Pence did talk to the Ukrainian leader about Trump’s “corruption” concerns, which Zelensky would understand as a reference to Trump’s desire for a Biden-related investigation.

New York’s Jon Chait added, in reference to Pence’s evasive answers to Vaughn Hillyard’s question:

When Pence met with Zelensky and was asked about the aid freeze, was he aware that Trump’s priorities were getting Ukraine to investigate his domestic opponents, including the Bidens? Pence won’t say. The answer is yes, he was aware. He was given a readout of Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, and when a reporter asked him on September 2 if the aid was being held up to compel the Biden probe, he answered in the affirmative, reframing it in the administration’s “corruption” code word. If Pence thought he could sustain a defense that he didn’t know what Trump wanted, he would.

Former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, an MSNBC contributor, also noted, “It’s not just that Pence won’t answer [Hillyard’s] questions, it’s also his demeanor – struggling, halting, clearly aware the truth is not his ally.”

The vice president and his team have had a few weeks to craft their talking points and get their story straight. It doesn’t appear to be going well."
