He wrote this week of a “my way or the highway” approach that is “condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.” He said, “It’s representative of an elitism that working- and middle-class people do not share: ‘We know best; you know nothing.’”

For the record, I’m agnostic on the Democratic field. I would vote for a tree stump if it could beat Trump. Biden, Obama and Nancy Pelosi, along with recent polling and the election results on Tuesday, all show that the best way to rid this country of Trump is for Democrats to dial back the condescension of their natural allies and dig into the gritty concerns of daily life.

Pete Buttigieg, looking to pick up the moderate left vote if Biden falters, has already taken Obama’s lesson to heart. “I’m not about being in the right place ideologically, whatever that means,” he said in Iowa last week. “I’m about having answers that are going to make sense.”

One of the biggest takeaways from the recent New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states is that Elizabeth Warren is not connecting with the very people her policies are supposed to help. Trump beats her or runs even in every tossup state but one. The persuadable voters in these states, many of them working class, say political correctness has gotten out of control, and they prefer someone seeking common ground over someone with a militantly progressive agenda.

It’s worth remembering that nearly two-thirds of all American adults do not have a four-year college degree. Warren, the Harvard professor who recently suggested that moderate Democrats belong with the other party, could be more effective with these folks if she showed more of her daughter-of-a-janitor side.

You can try to win the election by expanding the pool of progressive voters over all. But the inconvenient fact remains that a relatively small pool of working-class voters in the handful of battleground states are still likely to determine the fate of the country next year.

Democrats flipped 40 House seats in 2018 and attracted more white working-class voters — without insufferable wokedness. They hammered away on health care and kitchen table concerns. The same approach helped Democrats pull off an apparent upset in the Kentucky governor’s race this week."

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for the confidence of Democratic voters. Joe Biden continues to look unsteady on the campaign trail. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren look much better, but they also haven’t shown much interest in appealing to voters beyond their base, which has left a substantial number of Democrats anxious about their ability to beat President Trump next year.

This anxiety has lured Deval Patrick — the two-term former Massachusetts governor and longtime friend of Barack Obama — to enter the race. Patrick is getting a very late start and acknowledged he is a long shot. But he does have a plausible path, as I lay out on the new episode of “The Argument” podcast.

Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders remain among the best-positioned candidates in the primary election, with distinctive appeal to young people and other voters seeking a large-scale redraw of the political system — an overlapping agenda that drew roars of approval at the “First in the West” dinner.

And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. “If the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,” Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. “We win when we have solutions for the problems in people’s lives.”

While this should surprise no one, it exposes the Chinese Communist Party’s lies.”

The documents, provided by a member of the political establishment in China who is concerned about the crackdown, showed the direct involvement of senior officials in conceiving and ordering it. The papers included internal speeches by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, that laid the philosophical groundwork for the policy.

Mr. Geng, the foreign ministry spokesman, was asked about the article at a regularly scheduled briefing.

“It is precisely because of a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been deeply plagued by terrorism, has not had a violent terrorist incident for three years,” he said.

The Communist government once flatly dismissed reports on the mass detentions of as many as one million Muslims as fabrications, but since evidence of the camps has become irrefutable, it has stepped up attempts to defend its actions as justifiable steps to stamp out a national security threat.

Xinjiang has experienced violent attacks, but their extent remains unclear, in part because the authorities censored reports on them at the time and continues to restrict independent reporting.

After The Times published its report, China’s state media tried to rebuff criticism from ethnic Uighurs in the United States, whose criticism has been highlighted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, reported that its own reporters had visited the relatives of those Mr. Pompeo cited and found them living happily in Xinjiang."

And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. “If the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,” Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. “We win when we have solutions for the problems in people’s lives.”

Andrea Griffin, an elementary school nurse in Las Vegas, said she had been wary of Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate but came away feeling more confident after watching her on Sunday.

“I was a little skeptical about a plan for everything, but she has a pretty good grasp on what the major issues are and I kind of think that she might be able to get it done,” said Ms. Griffin, 56, a former independent voter who said she registered as a Democrat two weeks ago.

Ms. Griffin said she was also curious about Mr. Buttigieg, but had essentially ruled out Mr. Biden, explaining, “I think America is not ready to go back to business as usual.”"

While this should surprise no one, it exposes the Chinese Communist Party’s lies.”

The documents, provided by a member of the political establishment in China who is concerned about the crackdown, showed the direct involvement of senior officials in conceiving and ordering it. The papers included internal speeches by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, that laid the philosophical groundwork for the policy.

Mr. Geng, the foreign ministry spokesman, was asked about the article at a regularly scheduled briefing.

“It is precisely because of a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been deeply plagued by terrorism, has not had a violent terrorist incident for three years,” he said.

The Communist government once flatly dismissed reports on the mass detentions of as many as one million Muslims as fabrications, but since evidence of the camps has become irrefutable, it has stepped up attempts to defend its actions as justifiable steps to stamp out a national security threat.

Xinjiang has experienced violent attacks, but their extent remains unclear, in part because the authorities censored reports on them at the time and continues to restrict independent reporting.

After The Times published its report, China’s state media tried to rebuff criticism from ethnic Uighurs in the United States, whose criticism has been highlighted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, reported that its own reporters had visited the relatives of those Mr. Pompeo cited and found them living happily in Xinjiang."

One long-running bit on the show is about his opinion that women from San Antonio are overweight and ugly. “Inside the NBA” took advantage of the controversy his comments stoked by interviewing women in San Antonio and asking what they thought of Barkley.

He has also described the high-paced, 3-point-shooting offense the Golden State Warriors played during their championship runs as “little girly basketball” and said he’s “biased against girl basketball.” He added: “I love women’s basketball, but I don’t want it in the N.B.A.”

Throughout his playing career Barkley attracted television cameras because of the frequency with which he said or did outrageous things. He was arrested after breaking a man’s nose in a fight and arrested after throwing a man through a glass window. He once tried spitting on a heckling fan but instead hit an 8-year-old girl. In 1993 Nike parlayed Barkley’s reputation into one of its most famous commercials, in which Barkley declared, “I am not a role model.”

Barkley has been a panelist on “Inside the NBA” since 2000. It is widely considered the best studio show in sports, in large part because of Barkley’s willingness to say almost anything. He is one of the few retired stars who shows no qualms about criticizing current players, and the show frequently tackles knotty basketball and cultural issues that other sports shows seek to avoid.

He is expected to appear on the regular Thursday night “Inside the NBA” telecast. In 2015, Barkley signed a new contract with Turner Sports that was said to run for eight to 10 years."

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

In Buttigieg, voters get a candidate who can define neoliberalism in a sentence, who will even say that he thinks it’s a negative force in the world. But he has never explained what alternative he offers. Generational change, in the mayor’s case, doesn’t mean much. Voters will just get a younger version of a Democratic Party they already know.

The electability question

If you’ve heard only one adjective applied to Mr. Buttigieg, it’s “smart.” A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar who reportedly speaks eight languages, the mayor displays a facility with rhetoric and seriousness in demeanor that would doubtless take Aaron Sorkin several drafts to achieve.

His appeal, in aesthetic terms, is antithetical to President Trump’s. And part of his persona’s “magic,” according to the Times columnist David Brooks, is its potential to unify rather than further divide a deeply polarized country:

First, he is young and represents the rising generation, but he is also an older person’s idea of what a young person should be. … Second, he is gay and personifies the progress made by the L.G.B.T.Q. movement, but he doesn’t do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives. … Third, he is a localist and a Washington outsider, but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite.

Jennifer Rubin, a columnist for The Washington Post, writes that his image as a “verbally adept” moderate will serve him well in the presidential race:

As he shows command of policy and of the debate stage, he is making the case for his viability in the primary. And he implicitly is demonstrating that his cool, deliberate style would be a huge asset against Trump in the general election.

Not everyone is so convinced. Jay Caspian Kang, a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine, contends that his allure may be smaller than it appears in the fun-house mirror of national political commentary, shaped largely as it is by white, educated, upper-middle-class tastes:

With his air of decency and grab bag of gifted-and-talented party tricks, he doesn’t so much represent the will of the Democratic electorate but rather the aspirations of its educated elite, maybe especially those who see a shrinking market for their erudition. This form of identity politics has its consequences.

One such consequence may be his anemic support among black voters, which currently hovers at 2 percent nationwide. (It’s 0 percent in South Carolina.) Last month, an internal campaign memo surfaced claiming that “being gay was a barrier” for him with black voters, a narrative that the Times columnist Charles Blow in turn criticized as racist.

In any case, as Janell Ross reports at NBC News, his struggle to connect with black voters most likely has a lot to do with his positions — Ms. Ross notes that support for a national health care system is far stronger among blacks than whites, for example — and with his résumé: Mr. Buttigieg has sparked outrage for how he handled the fatal police shooting of Eric Logan, a black man, in South Bend; for firing the city’s popular black police chief; and, just this month, for falsely claiming that prominent black South Carolinians had endorsed his anti-racism plan, which his website promoted with a stock photo of a Kenyan woman.

A scandal should be able to lead to the removal of individual officials, but it should not reverse which party won an election. “If the electorate says that such-and-such a party should have the White House for four years, it ought to have the White House for four years,” Dwight Eisenhower wisely said.

The potential for a partisan reversal raises all kinds of problems. It creates incentives for one party to exaggerate a scandal (which, to be clear, is not happening in this case). It can also lead to more voters distrusting an impeachment process. “The whole point of having a line of succession is to ensure a smooth transition and a continuity of administration in a time of crisis,” my colleague Jesse Wegman has written. “Having a leader of the opposing party take over the White House, especially in an era of intense political polarization, would not achieve that, to put it mildly.”

Or as Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion writes: “It’s contrary to the entire structure of the constitutional system, which separates legislative from executive institutions and forces them to share powers.”

The line of succession stems from a 1947 law, and it can be changed with a new law anytime. Pelosi and House Democrats should pass such a law as soon as possible, so that every potential successor comes from the executive branch. It would be a victory for good government — and would also send a message about the severity of Trump’s and Pence’s high crimes and misdemeanors.

The Democratic debate

I was pleased to see that last night’s moderators didn’t ask about Medicare — an obsessive focus of the early debates — in any of their first nine questions. Pete Buttigieg brought up the subject, and the moderators asked a few follow-up questions. But they didn’t allow Medicare to dominate the debate. They found time for climate change, voting rights, China, the wealth tax and more. Nicely done, moderators — Rachel Maddow, Andrea Mitchell, Ashley Parker and Kristen Welker."

One long-running bit on the show is about his opinion that women from San Antonio are overweight and ugly. “Inside the NBA” took advantage of the controversy his comments stoked by interviewing women in San Antonio and asking what they thought of Barkley.

He has also described the high-paced, 3-point-shooting offense the Golden State Warriors played during their championship runs as “little girly basketball” and said he’s “biased against girl basketball.” He added: “I love women’s basketball, but I don’t want it in the N.B.A.”

Throughout his playing career Barkley attracted television cameras because of the frequency with which he said or did outrageous things. He was arrested after breaking a man’s nose in a fight and arrested after throwing a man through a glass window. He once tried spitting on a heckling fan but instead hit an 8-year-old girl. In 1993 Nike parlayed Barkley’s reputation into one of its most famous commercials, in which Barkley declared, “I am not a role model.”

Barkley has been a panelist on “Inside the NBA” since 2000. It is widely considered the best studio show in sports, in large part because of Barkley’s willingness to say almost anything. He is one of the few retired stars who shows no qualms about criticizing current players, and the show frequently tackles knotty basketball and cultural issues that other sports shows seek to avoid.

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

michael barbaro

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

In Buttigieg, voters get a candidate who can define neoliberalism in a sentence, who will even say that he thinks it’s a negative force in the world. But he has never explained what alternative he offers. Generational change, in the mayor’s case, doesn’t mean much. Voters will just get a younger version of a Democratic Party they already know.

The electability question

If you’ve heard only one adjective applied to Mr. Buttigieg, it’s “smart.” A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar who reportedly speaks eight languages, the mayor displays a facility with rhetoric and seriousness in demeanor that would doubtless take Aaron Sorkin several drafts to achieve.

His appeal, in aesthetic terms, is antithetical to President Trump’s. And part of his persona’s “magic,” according to the Times columnist David Brooks, is its potential to unify rather than further divide a deeply polarized country:

First, he is young and represents the rising generation, but he is also an older person’s idea of what a young person should be. … Second, he is gay and personifies the progress made by the L.G.B.T.Q. movement, but he doesn’t do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives. … Third, he is a localist and a Washington outsider, but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite.

Jennifer Rubin, a columnist for The Washington Post, writes that his image as a “verbally adept” moderate will serve him well in the presidential race:

As he shows command of policy and of the debate stage, he is making the case for his viability in the primary. And he implicitly is demonstrating that his cool, deliberate style would be a huge asset against Trump in the general election.

Not everyone is so convinced. Jay Caspian Kang, a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine, contends that his allure may be smaller than it appears in the fun-house mirror of national political commentary, shaped largely as it is by white, educated, upper-middle-class tastes:

With his air of decency and grab bag of gifted-and-talented party tricks, he doesn’t so much represent the will of the Democratic electorate but rather the aspirations of its educated elite, maybe especially those who see a shrinking market for their erudition. This form of identity politics has its consequences.

One such consequence may be his anemic support among black voters, which currently hovers at 2 percent nationwide. (It’s 0 percent in South Carolina.) Last month, an internal campaign memo surfaced claiming that “being gay was a barrier” for him with black voters, a narrative that the Times columnist Charles Blow in turn criticized as racist.

In any case, as Janell Ross reports at NBC News, his struggle to connect with black voters most likely has a lot to do with his positions — Ms. Ross notes that support for a national health care system is far stronger among blacks than whites, for example — and with his résumé: Mr. Buttigieg has sparked outrage for how he handled the fatal police shooting of Eric Logan, a black man, in South Bend; for firing the city’s popular black police chief; and, just this month, for falsely claiming that prominent black South Carolinians had endorsed his anti-racism plan, which his website promoted with a stock photo of a Kenyan woman.

Biden Jr. for president on Friday, snubbing the city’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, in a close-to-home example of Mr. Buttigieg’s struggle to attract black support.

The official, Oliver Davis, is a longtime Democratic member of the Common Council.

“In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it’s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country,” Mr. Davis said in an endorsement released by the Biden campaign.

Mr. Davis has been a frequent critic of Mr. Buttigieg since the mayor took office in 2012, seeking, for example, to tap the brakes on a signature initiative of the mayor’s to demolish or repair 1,000 run-down houses in 1,000 days. In 2016, he voted against the mayor’s effort to hire a diversity officer.

When a white officer from the South Bend Police Department fatally shot a black resident in June, setting off protests and anguished town hall events, the episode exposed deep distrust between the police and some members of South Bend’s minority community. Mr. Davis emerged as a sharp critic of the mayor’s management of the police in the national media."
30,David Leonhardt,"That should never happen. A scandal should be able to lead to the removal of individual officials, but it should not reverse which party won an election.

A scandal should be able to lead to the removal of individual officials, but it should not reverse which party won an election. “If the electorate says that such-and-such a party should have the White House for four years, it ought to have the White House for four years,” Dwight Eisenhower wisely said.

The potential for a partisan reversal raises all kinds of problems. It creates incentives for one party to exaggerate a scandal (which, to be clear, is not happening in this case). It can also lead to more voters distrusting an impeachment process. “The whole point of having a line of succession is to ensure a smooth transition and a continuity of administration in a time of crisis,” my colleague Jesse Wegman has written. “Having a leader of the opposing party take over the White House, especially in an era of intense political polarization, would not achieve that, to put it mildly.”

Or as Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion writes: “It’s contrary to the entire structure of the constitutional system, which separates legislative from executive institutions and forces them to share powers.”

The line of succession stems from a 1947 law, and it can be changed with a new law anytime. Pelosi and House Democrats should pass such a law as soon as possible, so that every potential successor comes from the executive branch. It would be a victory for good government — and would also send a message about the severity of Trump’s and Pence’s high crimes and misdemeanors.

I was pleased to see that last night’s moderators didn’t ask about Medicare — an obsessive focus of the early debates — in any of their first nine questions. Pete Buttigieg brought up the subject, and the moderators asked a few follow-up questions. But they didn’t allow Medicare to dominate the debate. They found time for climate change, voting rights, China, the wealth tax and more. Nicely done, moderators — Rachel Maddow, Andrea Mitchell, Ashley Parker and Kristen Welker."

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

Biden Jr. for president on Friday, snubbing the city’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, in a close-to-home example of Mr. Buttigieg’s struggle to attract black support.

The official, Oliver Davis, is a longtime Democratic member of the Common Council.

“In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it’s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country,” Mr. Davis said in an endorsement released by the Biden campaign.

Mr. Davis has been a frequent critic of Mr. Buttigieg since the mayor took office in 2012, seeking, for example, to tap the brakes on a signature initiative of the mayor’s to demolish or repair 1,000 run-down houses in 1,000 days. In 2016, he voted against the mayor’s effort to hire a diversity officer.

When a white officer from the South Bend Police Department fatally shot a black resident in June, setting off protests and anguished town hall events, the episode exposed deep distrust between the police and some members of South Bend’s minority community. Mr. Davis emerged as a sharp critic of the mayor’s management of the police in the national media."

Our studies found that the degree of support for Scott Miller wasn’t much affected by whether his policy platform was highly progressive or more moderate. Overall, people showed a slight preference for the highly progressive candidate, but this result was small and statistically significant only in one of our studies.

What mattered far more was how Scott Miller talked about those policies. We found that when he spoke of his platform in terms of conservative values like patriotism, family and the American dream, he consistently drew more support than did the Scott Miller who couched those same policies in more liberal values like economic justice and compassion.

Interestingly, most of the increase in support for the Scott Miller with conservative values came from participants who identified as moderate as well as those who identified as conservative. Notably, liberals were inclined to support the candidate regardless of which rhetorical approach he took.

These results suggest that the most effective Democratic challenger to President Trump in 2020 would invoke conservative values while offering progressive economic policies.

This description does not closely match any of the top Democratics — with the notable exception of Pete Buttigieg, who pairs invocations of freedom, military security and religious faith with a progressive platform. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Mr. Buttigieg is also the candidate who has most outperformed expectations so far.

Some progressives may bristle at the prospect of a Democratic candidate who employs rhetoric associated with conservatism. But there are reasons that even stalwart progressives might soften on this point. For one thing, Democrats typically tack to the center after winning the nomination, often compromising or abandoning their most progressive policies. Wouldn’t it be preferable to stick to those popular progressive policies, making the case for them using language that would appeal to more Americans?

But the issue is not just rhetorical. There is nothing that inherently binds valuing family, security and the American dream to conservative economic policies. Perhaps these values are served just as well — or even better — by progressive economic policies. If so, Democrats should do more to stress that fact, emphasizing more strongly how their policies can address the concerns of a wider range of Americans.

This weakness and Biden’s strength with these same voters are obvious reasons to doubt the case for Bernie as the unifier, Bernie as the eventual nominee.

Especially since Sanders has thus far ignored my advice (I know, the nerve) that he reassure skeptics by telling them that he has a record as a dealmaker, that he can moderate on certain issues, so they can feel safe supporting him even if they aren’t ready for the revolution.

But still: If you are a wavering Democrat concerned about both party unity and ultimate electability, about exciting all the diverse factions of your base while also competing for the disaffected, both the relative breadth of Bernie’s primary coalition and his decent polling among non-voters and Obama-Trump voters are reasons to give him another look.

That decent polling, I suspect, reflects a sense among voters drawn to populism that Bernie is different from not only the more centrist candidates — latecomers Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick especially, but Buttigieg as well — but also from his fellow left-winger, Warren, who has fully embraced the culture-war breadth of the new progressivism while Sanders remains, fundamentally, an economic-policy monomaniac.

He’s still a social liberal, of course, and he isn’t in the culturally conservative/economic populist quadrant where so many unrepresented voters reside. But for the kind of American who is mostly with the Democrats on economics but wary of progressivism’s zest for culture war, Sanders’s socialism might be strangely reassuring — as a signal of what he actually cares about, and what battles he might eschew for the sake of his anti-plutocratic goals. (At the very least he’s no more radical on an issue like abortion than a studied moderate like Mayor Pete.)

This is why, despite technically preferring a moderate like Biden or Amy Klobuchar, I keep coming back to the conservative’s case for Bernie — which rests on the perhaps-wrong but still attractive supposition that he’s the liberal most likely to spend all his time trying to tax the rich and leave cultural conservatives alone.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have proposed making college free for everyone, Buttigieg is taking a more targeted approach of giving free tuition only to families he considers middle-class and lower. His new policy calls for reduced tuition at public universities for families earning $100,000 to $150,000 and no tuition for those below that threshold. Like several in the Democratic field, Buttigieg also proposes expanding Pell Grants to help low-income students pay for housing and fees and investing $50 billion in historically black colleges.

Buttigieg’s new economic plan includes proposals for universal prekindergarten, greater college access, major expansions of affordable housing and job training, and a bigger tax credit for the working poor. He plans to fund the $2.1 trillion worth of new expenditures over the next decade by hiking taxes on the top 1 percent of earners.

The release of the eight-page plan comes as Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has climbed into the top tier of Democratic presidential contenders in Iowa. Buttigieg increasingly appears to be carving a policy lane that is left of former vice president Joe Biden but not nearly as far as Warren and Sanders. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Buttigieg’s college and health-care plans.

While Biden proposed free community college for all Americans, Buttigieg’s plan expanded that to include four-year public universities, but only for those in the bottom 80 percent. Warren and Sanders want free two- and four-year college for all and cancellation of most, if not all, of the $1.6 trillion in student loans. So far, Buttigieg has only called for student debt forgiveness for people in “low quality” programs, such as many for-profit schools.

On health care, Warren and Sanders are backing Medicare-for-all, in which every American would be enrolled in the government plan, while Buttigieg and Biden favor a public option, which the South Bend mayor likes to call “Medicare for All Who Want It.”

AD

“Pete is proposing plans targeted to making programs affordable for the middle class and below, not giving it free to everyone,” said Austan Goolsbee, an economic adviser to Buttigieg and former chief economist for President Barack Obama.

Others argue that Buttigieg does not go far enough in his policies and that his definition of $100,000 as the cutoff for the free college is arbitrary, especially in a nation where costs vary greatly in big cities and more rural areas.

“A $100,000 income ceiling is a lot of money in some states and not very much in others,” said Michelle Miller-Adams, a senior researcher at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research who has studied existing free college programs in numerous states and cities.

There is widespread agreement in the 2020 Democratic field that inequality is a top issue and that the wealthy need to pay more in taxes, but how much more is a heavy debate.

AD

Warren has pitched a wealth tax on Americans with more than $50 million in assets, among other new taxes on the rich. Buttigieg favors a more slimmed-down approach of taxing the capital gains of the top 1 percent every year by forcing the richest Americans to calculate how much their assets rose (or fell) each year, even if they do not sell the asset. The rich would have to pay the top income tax rate on any capital gains, according to the Buttigieg plan, a major shift from the current system, which taxes capital gains at a lower rate to encourage people to invest.

Buttigieg, who hails from the Midwest, casts himself as someone who understands the plight of the working class. In this latest plan, he is aiming to show some policy leadership by calling for a major expansion of the earned income tax credit (EITC) that helps the working poor, $200 billion more over the next decade for job training and $5 billion to ensure apprenticeships are available within 30 miles of every American.

AD

“As president, I will measure success not just by the size of the stock market or gross domestic product, but by whether working and middle-class families are succeeding,” Buttigieg writes in the plan’s introduction.

AD

His EITC plan is based off the Working Families Tax Relief Act that several Democratic senators proposed earlier this year, including Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) who is also running for president. The goal is to increase the income of low-income workers with kids and without kids by giving them a refundable tax credit, meaning if the credit is larger than the amount of tax they owe, the U.S. government would write them a check.

An analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that about 35 million American households would get a bigger tax credit under the plan, averaging about $1,000. The expanded tax credit would be available only to families earning under about $55,000 a year.

AD

The EITC has historically had bipartisan support, as people must be working to receive it, but Republicans did not include an expansion of the credit in their 2017 tax bill.

AD

“The EITC is the most effective anti-poverty program we have, lifting millions of people, including children, out of poverty. It also increases employment,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. He called this particular proposal a “welcome development.”

Democratic candidate Julián Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration, has also proposed expanding the EITC. Castro would go further and also make the child tax credit fully refundable, another benefit to lower-income families that Buttigieg did not include in his plan. Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have also pitched tax credits that would primarily benefit the bottom 60 percent, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

AD

Buttigieg is also launching new plans on Friday to invest $700 billion in universal prekindergarten and free child care from birth to age 5 for low-income families. On housing, he is pitching $430 billion over a decade to add or restore 2 million more affordable-housing units and expand the low-income voucher program. These measures are on top of previously announced support for a $15 minimum wage and a $1.5 trillion green infrastructure plan.

Joe Biden has already sustained a lot of damage to his candidacy – and he’s still trucking along. But what if he actually starts losing in early states? I spoke with Intelligencer writers Ed Kilgore and Eric Levitz about whether his “electability” argument would go out the window, or whether he has a strong enough base to support him during truly tough times.

Ben: With a million predictions of his demise not having come to pass, Joe Biden is still doing very well in national and state polls at this late date, with a couple of very important exceptions. He has struggled of late in Iowa, where multiple recent polls have him in fourth place, behind Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg (not respectively in all polls). And he has recently trailed Warren in New Hampshire. These two states are, of course, the first two to vote in the primary calendar. They’re also heavily white, and Biden is expected to do far better in South Carolina and Nevada, states that more accurately reflect the diversity of the Democratic Party. But I wonder: If he fails to win either Iowa or New Hampshire, will he even be in a position to capitalize?

Ed: My quick answer is that it depends on who wins. It may be difficult to keep up with a candidate who wins both Iowa and NH — unless it’s, say, Buttigieg, who could struggle in states with minority voters. If other candidates split Iowa and NH, that’s much better for Biden. It also may depend on who actually does get knocked out in IA and NH. If, say, Warren wins both and Bernie drops out, you’ve got a fast-charging Warren in what may be a one-on-one battle with Biden.

Eric: I think that even in the worst-case scenario for Biden — Warren wins both Iowa and New Hampshire — Joe wouldn’t necessarily be doomed (as the conventional wisdom suggests). If Pete doesn’t win one of those, he’s almost certainly done. Same probably goes for Sanders. Harris shows no signs of turning things around, so let’s assume she doesn’t put in a strong second-place finish in either state. So you’ve got a two-candidate race, with one of those candidates being the bane of a very deep-pocketed wing of the party. I feel like the combination of moderate-donor consolidation behind Biden plus his surrogates blasting a “don’t let lily-white states choose our diverse party’s nominee for us” message might be sufficient to preserve his advantage in South Carolina. And then a big win there changes “the narrative.”

Ed: Yeah, I agree with all that. But historically, candidates who win both Iowa and NH tend to win the whole thing. You know, like ALL of them. One factor is the IA/NH “bounce.”

Ben: I was about to ask if there’s any historical precedent for what Eric just described. It appears there is not. But, hey, a lot of unusual things have been happening in primaries lately!

Eric: Yeah. Also, the sample size for modern presidential primaries is not large.

Ed: I know, I’m just saying that nobody’s derailed a double winner just yet.

Eric: Certainly, I’d put my money on Warren if she emerged with wins in both those states.

Ben: I also think donors — not all of them but quite a lot — might warm to her a bit if they saw she could win a couple of hard-fought races.

Ed: Yeah, I think the blowback to Bernie being the “putative nominee” would be more intense. And as I believe we’ve both said, if Pete catches fire and wins two virtually all-white states, there will be a backlash to crowning him.

Eric: Granted, Liz could seal things up if she really want to …

Ben: Haha. I think the big question is whether Biden’s over-65 voters, who mostly like him because they think he can beat Trump, which will be sufficiently shaken by early defeats that they switch their support to someone else.

Ed: And I’m not sure we know the answer to that.Though again, if Warren wins twice, and particularly if she’s been on an upward arc and is dominating later-state polls, I think she will be hard to stop.

Ben: The lack of proximity of many people who work in media to real-life Biden supporters does add an element of mystery to all this in my mind.

Ed: My wife is a Biden supporter. I have a lot of proximity to her. She is neither a senior nor a person of color, however.

Eric: Yeah. That informs my caution in ruling out Biden’s staying power, even if he falls flat in two states with an unusually high share of white liberals in their primary electorates.

Ed: We’ve seen some recent gains by both Sanders (especially) and Warren among minority voters. But not by Pete. I’d have to think that after 2016, Democrats will stay united no matter what.

Ben: If Biden comes roaring back and this turns into a knock-down, drag-out, monthslong fight, is that bad news at all for Democrats?

Eric: The sooner the primary ends, the better the party’s prospects for winning in 2020, I’d think.

Ed: But if elbows get sharp, it will give some ammo to Trump.

Eric: Unless, I guess, one stipulates that a long primary would have a “survival of the fittest” effect, and thus produce a stronger nominee.

Ed: Or Bloomberg on a late sea of money. Just kiddin’.

Eric: Seems more likely to me though that resources would be diverted, and a lot of promising attack lines for Trump beta tested.

Ed: I dunno. The strengths and weaknesses of candidates in primaries don’t necessarily transfer to a close general election. Remember when HRC was the toast of the white working class in the 2008 primaries? She even drank a beer on camera.

Fat lot of good that did her in 2016.

I am curious about how voters will measure “electability” after a few primaries are in the can. Will winning primaries make candidates look more electable against Trump? That’s probably what voters will think, whether it’s right or wrong.

Ben: Right, but that’s probably not such a rational calculation, is it? The aura of winning matters.

Ed: Ah, the golden halo of victory in South Dakota (or wherever). Hey, when Rick Santorum went on a brief winning streak in 2012, people briefly though the sweater vest was cool, not idiotic. As someone who owned several, I was grateful.

Ben: Ha, right. As Eric wrote today, Michael Bloomberg’s possible entry into the race seems like bad news for Biden. Do you think it’ll make his Iowa/New Hampshire problems significantly worse — or make it more difficult to win the states he would need after?

Ed: Depends on what “it” is. If Bloomberg just runs a bunch of ads attacking Bernie and Warren, without really promoting himself, it could help Biden.

Eric: My view is if Bloomberg has any impact, it will be to hurt Biden and Buttigieg. I’m skeptical that he won’t land with roughly the same thud as Steyer.

Ben: That is basically my view — it’ll have very little effect.

Ed: But if he goes all out, sure, it will affect somebody. Probably Pete. Not 100 percent sure it will strictly hurt Biden. I look at the profile of the SC Biden voter, and I do not see a Bloomberg fan.

Eric: Yeah. I don’t know. I just have a hard time wrapping my mind around the Bloomberg candidacy.

Ed: Me too. Or the Steyer candidacy. With which it has a certain similarity; can’t quite put my finger on it, though.

Eric: If New York held the first-in-the-nation primary, maybe I could discern a logic to it. But I don’t see any significant constituency for him among Democratic primary voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina … really anywhere outside of New York’s orbit that doesn’t have a significant Jewish population.

Ed: Do we agree Bloomberg (or for that matter, Steyer) offers a nice punching bag for Warren and Sanders?

Eric: He’s a better punching bag than Steyer, who at least has ostensibly progressive politics. Bloomberg’s made a prolonged public case for the necessity of having the police systematically harass young black men, and against the idea that the financial industry bore any responsibility for the 2008 crisis (which he blamed on Congress forcing banks to loan to poor people). Also, for cutting Social Security.

Ed: Yep. Yep. And Yep.

Eric: Ideal foil for Bernard and Elizabeth.

Ed: Believe I said this yesterday as well, but Bloomberg (and Steyer, and all the others of their class talking about it) running for president has given me new respect for Bernie’s position that billionaires should not exist.

Eric: Michael, if you’re listening, please know that you can definitely buy my silence.

Ed: I’ve seen those Brooklyn real-estate brochures on your desk, Eric. That stuff doesn’t come cheap.

Eric: I’m a simple man with simple tastes, who simply wants to buy the Barclays Center.

Ed: Haha.

Ben: So, to wrap up, all is not lost if Biden blows IA and NH — just some.

Eric: Yeah, that is my take.

Ed: Agree."

Why exactly might the party and country need him?

There is a competitive primary underway, with multiple Democrats who in head-to-head match-ups with President Trump beat him handily. Democrats have multiple advocates for tough gun safety laws and ambitious versions of the Green New Deal, two of Bloomberg’s top issues. Democrats can choose from four septuagenarians. (Bloomberg, 77, is younger than Sen. Bernie Sanders but older than former vice president Joe Biden.) Democrats can select from three current or past mayors (Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Sen. Cory Booker). Democrats do not lack for a billionaire (Tom Steyer) nor several millionaires.

What viewpoint or skill set is missing from the field that Bloomberg possesses — other than the ability to annoy fellow New Yorker Trump, who is worth a pittance (even by his own exaggerated estimate) compared to Bloomberg, who is reportedly worth $52 billion? That is no small matter, but certainly there are many candidates capable of heckling Trump. Bloomberg could pay for ads (for all the candidates!) documenting Trump’s financial, ethical and policy failings. He does not need to run in order to pester the failing president.

The overwhelming percentage of Democratic primary voters say they are happy with the field. Where is the throng of voters insisting on more choices?

AD

AD

The conventional wisdom is that Bloomberg’s entry amounts to a snub of Biden. Why it is not a snub of Elizabeth Warren or Buttigieg or others is not clear. In reality, Bloomberg’s belated entry is a snub of the primary selection process (whether deserved or not). He seems to believe he can buy name ID that others have gained over months of hard work.

I suspect Bloomberg will not get far, if he actually takes the plunge. Early state voters really do like the candidates to show up again and again. Dropping in at the last minute probably does not get him many admirers in New Hampshire or Iowa.

Maybe he is playing the game another New York City mayor did, waiting for a state much later in the race to break through. That was the loopy theory of one Rudolph Giuliani, who thought it was smart to wait for Florida to make his big move. He never won a state.

Biden and the rest should not feel slighted. I suspect most of them will be happy to jab at another billionaire candidate and tout their own humble beginnings (Scranton! Oklahoma!). They might even seem more appealing by comparison, if only because they are working hard to earn voters’ support.

In any event, the Democratic contenders should keep their eyes on the other New York billionaire, the one scuttling the Constitution, paying a $2 million fine for running a scam foundation (“The president admitted, among other things, to improperly arranging for the charity to pay $10,000 for a 6-foot portrait of him”) and facing impeachment for soliciting a bribe from Ukraine.

Michael Bloomberg is putting his money where his money is, moving to launch a self-funded bid for the Democratic presidential nomination as the intraparty fight over taxing the ultrarich intensifies.

The former New York mayor — with a net worth of $52 billion he started amassing as a Wall Street investment banker more than 50 years ago — has been critical of the party’s leftward drift. His possible entry in the race promises immediately to sharpen what was already shaping up to be a defining debate over inequality and the concentration of corporate power.

Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson wrote in a series of tweets that the could-be candidate is exploring a run out of fear that the crop of 2020 Democratic hopefuls isn’t up to the job of defeating President Trump:

In 2018, he spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable. And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature. — howard wolfson (@howiewolf) November 7, 2019

If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America’s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America’s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist. — howard wolfson (@howiewolf) November 7, 2019

The not-so-subtle subtext: Former vice president Joe Biden hasn’t sufficiently established his strength in the race’s moderate lane and neither have those jockeying to overtake him there, while Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are too far left to win a general election.

Warren and Sanders welcomed Bloomberg to the contest by making clear they intend to make his wealth count against him:

The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 7, 2019

Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg! If you're looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here: https://t.co/6UMSAf90NT — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 7, 2019

Warren’s tweet linked to a wealth tax calculator her campaign launched earlier in the day. After the Bloomberg news broke, the calculator added a link just for him (in addition to dedicated links for Microsoft founder Bill Gates and hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman, both of whom criticized her wealth tax proposal this week). Per the calculator, Bloomberg would face a $3.079 billion bill under Warren’s proposal to impose a 6 percent levy on billionaires’ net worths to fund her $20.5 trillion Medicare-for-all plan.

“It’s not enough just to have somebody come in, anybody, and say they’re going to buy this election,” Warren said on the campaign trail, per the New York Times's Alex Burns, who broke the story. Per Burns, ""Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, signaled the stiff resistance Mr. Bloomberg would face if he joined the race. 'More billionaires seeking more political power surely isn’t the change America needs,' Mr. Shakir said in an email.""

Bloomberg spent more than $110 million boosting Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms and pledged to spend at least $500 million more this cycle to defeat Trump. He has given more than $150 million to envrionmental groups, promised another $500 million to close every coal-fired power plant in the U.S., and spent tens of millions more promoting gun safety.

But he also drew a clear distinction with the Warren and Sanders wing of the party on economic issues as he circled a candidacy earlier this year. “In January, on one of his final New Hampshire trips before initially deciding against a bid, Bloomberg told The Post that Warren’s wealth tax was ‘probably unconstitutional,’ and warned that seriously pursuing it could wreck the country’s prosperity,” my colleagues Matt Viser and Michael Scherer write.

Bloomberg at the time said Democrats “shouldn’t be embarrassed about our system. If you want to look at a system that’s not capitalistic, just take a look at was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today people are starving to death. It’s called Venezuela.”

Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group called Bloomberg’s move “more of a hedge should Biden collapse after the Iowa Caucuses on February 3 than the launch of a national campaign.”

“We struggle to see the party of wealth taxes nominating a billionaire whose name is literally synonymous with Wall Street,” Krueger writes in a note. “We suspect Bloomberg will start with a hammerlock on former Republican, socially libertarian, fiscal conservatives, white, affluent men...which is not exactly an ascendant core constituency of the Democratic Party. But it is arguably the most vocal subsection terrified of Warren if you have seen CNBC in the last few weeks.”

TRUMP TRACKER

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— China, U.S. make progress: “Negotiators are making progress toward finalizing a partial trade deal between the United States and China, including agreeing on the removal of some of the tariffs that have disrupted trans-Pacific commerce for the past year and a half,” my colleagues David J. Lynch and Gerry Shih report.

“But American and Chinese diplomats still must resolve several core issues before the text is ready for [Trump] and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign, according to people familiar with the talks... Nearly four weeks after Trump said the two sides had reached an 'agreement in principle,' the White House and China continue to haggle over terms. Among them: the extent to which the United States will roll back tariffs on Chinese imports as well as specific Chinese pledges to protect the intellectual property and trade secrets of U.S. companies. Some other provisions are largely complete, including ones that govern currency moves and the opening of China’s financial services market to foreign companies.”

… Not so fast, say some in the White House: “An agreement between the United States and China to roll back existing tariffs as part of a ‘phase one’ trade deal faces fierce internal opposition in the White House and from outside advisers, multiple sources familiar with the talks said,” Reuters’s Heather Timmons and Jeff Mason report.

“The idea of a tariff rollback was not part of the original October ‘handshake’ deal between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. [Trump], the sources said. But there is a divide within the administration over whether rolling back tariffs will give away U.S. leverage in the negotiations, current and former administration officials said. The Chinese Communist Party is trying to ‘re-trade’ the agreement, said Stephen Bannon, former White House adviser. He added that rolling back earlier tariffs ‘goes against the grain’ of the original October agreement.”

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro to Fox Business, per Bloomberg News: ""There is no agreement at this time to remove any of the existing tariffs as a condition of the phase one deal. The only person who can make that decision is [Trump]. It’s as simple as that.”

— Trump administration moves closer to loosening gun export rules: “The Trump administration has passed a key milestone in a long-delayed rule change that would make it easier to sell U.S. firearms outside the United States, including assault rifles and ammunition, people briefed on the matter told Reuters,” Reuters’s Mike Stone and David Shepardson report.

“The proposed rule changes, which would move oversight of commercial firearm exports from the U.S. Department of State to the Department of Commerce, could be enacted as soon as the end of this year, the sources said late on Wednesday.”

TRUMP WATCH:

— Trump ordered to pay $2 million to charities: “A New York judge ordered [Trump] to pay $2 million in damages for misusing funds from a tax-exempt charity — taking the charity’s money to pay debts for his for-profit businesses, to boost his 2016 campaign and to buy himself art, according to court documents,” my colleagues David A. Fahrenthold and Joshua Partlow report.

“That order, from state judge Saliann Scarpulla, settled a lawsuit filed against Trump last year by the New York attorney general. The lawsuit — based on information first uncovered by The Washington Post — alleged ‘persistently illegal conduct’ at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, where Trump served as president for 32 years.”

Key paragraph: “As part of the settlement, Trump also agreed to disburse the $1.8 million remaining in the foundation to a set of charities, and to shutter it for good. In a statement signed by Trump’s attorney, the president admitted to poor oversight of the charity and to seven specific instances where its money was misspent.”

— Stocks rally on trade optimism. CNN Business's Anneken Tappe: ""It was another record-breaking day in the US stock market, after a Chinese official said that Washington and Beijing have discussed rolling back tariffs... The Dow and the S&P 500 recorded a new all-time closing high. The Dow ended up 0.7%, or 182 points, logging its third record of the week, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.3%. It was the index' second record of the week... Gains were broad across industries, with only seven Dow stocks ending in the red. Energy, telecommunications and tech stocks were the best-performing in the S&P 500.""

Demand for havens is collapsing. Bloomberg's Luke Kawa: ""As investors fretted for most of the year that the trade war and slowing growth would end in a global recession, assets like gold and sovereign bonds provided protection. That ended spectacularly Thursday. Gold lost as much as $30 an ounce, Treasuries tumbled the most since summer and defensive equities sank. While continued signs of a detente in the U.S.-China trade war sparked the day moves, such a beat-down has been months in the making as peak pessimism on global and U.S. growth has ebbed.""

— Economists split on cause of hiring skid. WSJ's Harriet Torry: ""Economists are roughly split over whether the recent hiring slowdown reflects primarily a shortage of workers or softening demand for labor, a sign of continuing uncertainty about the outlook.In The Wall Street Journal’s latest survey of economists, 45.3% blamed the slowdown on the tight labor market, which has made it harder for many employers to find enough workers. An additional 37.7% of respondents said the issue was ebbing desire to expand payrolls. The first explanation would suggest the economic expansion can continue at a solid pace if more potential workers can be drawn into the labor force from sidelines.""

— Gilead sued by administration over Truvada patent: “A rift between the Centers for Disease Control and pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences ruptured further Wednesday when the Trump administration sued Gilead in U.S. District Court, asserting that Gilead made billions of dollars on HIV prevention therapy while repeatedly ignoring government patents,” my colleague Christopher Rowland reports.

“The patent infringement case against a major drug company, coming at a time of increasing political anger over drug prices, signals a shift in a relationship that typically has been collaborative. The San Francisco-based company has worked for years with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fight HIV, including providing free drugs for government experiments, as well as efforts to expand treatment of hepatitis C.”

— Pensions taking more risks to get returns: “Some pension-fund managers are venturing further into unusual investment territory as this year’s plunge in bond yields makes it harder to find decent long-term returns,” the Wall Street Journal’s Avantika Chilkoti and Caitlin Ostroff report.

“Funds are dabbling in riskier asset classes, including private markets, real-estate projects, infrastructure financing and direct lending. Some are making riskier fixed-income bets, buying volatile assets such as 100-year Argentine government bonds. Others are going farther afield, investing in greenhouses and waste management.”

— GM sells Lordstown plant: “General Motors Co confirmed … it has sold its shuttered Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio to a start-up that has an ambitious plan to begin building electric pickup trucks by the end of 2020,” Reuters’s David Shepardson reports.

“Lordstown Motors Corp, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc, has retained Ohio investment bank Brown Gibbons Lang & Co and is working to raise additional capital, Lordstown Chief Executive Steve Burns said in an interview. Workhorse shares closed up 27% on the news.”

— Uber employees can now sell their stock, but the value has tanked: “On Wednesday morning, Uber employees woke up early and prepared for the worst: a nose-dive in stock price, just as they could finally sell their shares,” my colleagues Nitasha Tiku and Faiz Siddiqui report.

“At the opening bell, which ended the six-month period that prevented employees from selling, the stock sank 7 percent to about $26, hitting a low since Uber went public at $45 a share in May.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Buttigieg pitches free college for families earning less than $100,000. The Post's Heather Long: ""Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is unveiling a plan Friday to make tuition at four-year public colleges free for families earning up to $100,000. The move is part of a package of new economic policies aimed at boosting the fortunes of middle- and working-class Americans and positioning Buttigieg as a clear alternative to more liberal candidates.

""While Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have proposed making college free for everyone, Buttigieg is taking a more targeted approach of giving free tuition only to families he considers middle-class and lower. His new policy calls for reduced tuition at public universities for families earning $100,000 to $150,000 and no tuition for those below that threshold. Like several in the Democratic field, Buttigieg also proposes expanding Pell Grants to help low-income students pay for housing and fees and investing $50 billion in historically black colleges.""

The pay-for: Hiking capital gains taxes on the wealthy: Per Heather, Buttigieg proposes ""taxing the capital gains of the top 1 percent every year by forcing the richest Americans to calculate how much their assets rose (or fell) each year, even if they do not sell the asset. The rich would have to pay the top income tax rate on any capital gains, according to the Buttigieg plan, a major shift from the current system, which taxes capital gains at a lower rate to encourage people to invest.""

In Concord, Biden offered gracious words for Bloomberg after filing for next year’s primary but left no doubt he’s ready for the competition: “Michael’s a solid guy and let’s see where it goes. I have no problems with him being in the race.” He was quick to add, “The last polls I looked at, I’m pretty far ahead.

Buttigieg, in a brief Saturday morning interview before continuing his bus tour of the state, said the voters he’s been talking to are in the process of looking at the existing field and trying to narrow it down, albeit they are focused on “which one of us is best to beat Donald Trump.” As for a hunger for someone new to join the race, Buttigieg said, “That’s not something I’ve heard from voters.”

All the early reactions might be premature, given the fluidity in the Democratic race. Bloomberg’s apparent decision to run for president has for now sharpened the discussion about the qualities of the current candidates and the party’s prospects in November 2020.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has gained the upper hand in the nomination contest.

The unsettled nature of the Democratic nomination campaign has left many Democrats wondering whether any of their candidates can go the distance. That’s the ground on which Bloomberg is building his candidacy — the deep-seated fear that Trump, for all his problems, may be more than equal to the task of winning a second term.

At the same time, many Democrats with long experience in presidential politics are baffled by Bloomberg’s decision. Oh, they know he has long wanted to be president, that he looked at it seriously in several recent cycles, only to pull back and conclude that he couldn’t win, and for Bloomberg, winning is the thing he wants.

Almost every attribute Bloomberg brings to the campaign is already spoken for by the current field. A mayor? There’s Buttigieg or former Newark mayor Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro. A moderate? Well, there’s Biden and Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and . . .

He’s a billionaire willing to spend a fortune. So is Tom Steyer. He is a septuagenarian, if people are looking for older candidates, but so are Biden, Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). He’s a successful business executive. Andrew Yang is a business success as well.

One of Bloomberg’s signature issues that might appeal to the Democratic base is gun control. Former congressman Beto O’Rourke made that his signature issue after the horrific mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, calling for mandatory confiscation of assault weapons. He dropped out a week ago. Another of Bloomberg’s issues is climate change. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington based his whole campaign on that issue and he lasted only a few months before quitting the race.

Still, there is something about Bloomberg that draws outsized attention, and for reasons that go beyond his willingness to spend perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign. He does have a record success in business and in politics. He is admired for his competence and his leadership (and his philanthropy) by fellow mayors who have worked with him over the years.

Other Democrats are indebted to him for the money he has invested in campaigns. He has spent freely to push for action on climate change and to promote gun control legislation, including the dollars he poured into Virginia legislative races this fall that helped Democrats neutralize the National Rifle Association in the state where the NRA is headquartered.

Still, Democrats are puzzled by his decision, wondering just how and why he thinks that, at this relatively late date, he believes he can mount a successful campaign. They acknowledge that the team around him includes smart, tough, shrewd people. They know that Bloomberg and his team are data driven and will make decisions based on their best reading of what the numbers tell them.

They know that his money is a huge asset, even if he is attacked by Sanders and Warren for trying to buy an election. Warren responded to his entry with a welcome and an online calculator to show how much her wealth tax could cost Bloomberg. The answer: about $6 billion.

Bloomberg won’t run a conventional campaign. Beyond that, he’s looking to defy the odds in many ways. For example, nobody has gotten in this late and won. Retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who many Democrats thought had exactly the right attributes to take down then-President George W. Bush, tried a late entry in the early fall of 2003 and flopped.

Former senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee jumped into the 2008 Republican nomination campaign in the early fall of 2007. Some Republicans thought he was the new Ronald Reagan. Instead, with minimal effort, he got nowhere.

AD

When he was Texas’s governor, Rick Perry waited until late summer of 2011 to announce his bid for the GOP nomination. The campaign of Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee, set out to destroy his candidacy and succeeded within a few months.

Bloomberg plans to defy conventions in another way. He apparently has decided not to compete seriously in any of the four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina (although it is not yet clear whether he will seek to qualify for the ballots in those states).

The Democratic Party chairs of Iowa and New Hampshire issued statements late Friday lamenting Bloomberg’s decision to bypass their events.

AD

New Hampshire’s Ray Buckley said: “We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn’t run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states.”

AD

Iowa’s Troy Price said: “Iowa is one of the last places where retail politics and grass-roots organizing run strong, and our process — along with the other early states — makes candidates and their campaigns better prepared for a general election fight.”

Those two Democrats have particular concerns about the Bloomberg strategy. If successful, it could render the Iowa-New Hampshire hegemony at the front of the nominating process moot, something politicians in other states would be happy to see. But skipping the early states would mean Bloomberg could run for the nomination and rarely expose himself to direct questioning from voters.

AD

Bloomberg is certainly taking a risk by skipping the early states. Rudolph W. Giuliani, another former New York mayor, tried essentially that same strategy in 2008. He led the polls among Republicans for much of 2007 but never settled on how he wanted to navigate Iowa or New Hampshire. Instead, he pointed to Florida as his breakout state. With poor showings earlier, however, he had no momentum by the time of Florida. His candidacy sank there.

AD

The 2020 calendar offers Bloomberg an option this time to try again. Super Tuesday comes days after the South Carolina primary, and it will be one of the biggest single delegate hauls in history. It could also cost a fortune to compete widely. Democrats who know the financial demands of these kinds of events say it could cost $100 million to mount a television campaign across that many states, which include California and Texas.

Another Democrat who has been through the recent cycles offered this cautionary note about the value of TV ads. Presidential nominations are not won simply with blanket television advertising. It’s much more about winning begetting winning and building on free media — which is to say the news coverage and the narratives that coverage produces."

Nearly six weeks after suffering a heart attack that pushed his campaign to its lowest point, the famously grumpy U.S. senator from Vermont has reemerged as a more easygoing figure, sprinkling more humor into his policy-centric speeches and opening up about his age, immigrant roots and upbringing — topics he has long resisted emphasizing, despite repeated pleas by his aides.

AD

Sanders is also different in private, according to people who have spoken with him. A candidate with a reputation for sometimes stubbornly disregarding advice and assistance, Sanders is suddenly putting more faith in his brain trust, according to campaign officials, a shift his campaign manager attributes to a moment of clarity when he was hospitalized.

The changes underline one of the most remarkable political recoveries of recent years. In the days after his Oct. 1 heart attack, Sanders’s medical status was unclear and his confidants wondered whether his already struggling campaign would continue. Now, he is performing better in the polls than before his health scare.

AD

“It was a profound moment in his life,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign. “I think he’s sort of liberated from any of the traditional weight of the campaign, and he’s just campaigning now as the Bernie Sanders you see in private.”

AD

The senator’s rebound has reignited his battle for the Democratic Party’s liberal faction with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who a few weeks ago appeared on the verge of consolidating its support. Their renewed rivalry is part of the ongoing turbulence in the Democratic race, which has tightened in recent weeks and could grow to include former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Still, there is no denying the challenges the health scare continues to pose for Sanders, who is the oldest candidate in the race. Polls show Democratic voters are much more concerned about his age and health than they are about his two septuagenarian rivals, Warren, 70, and former vice president Joe Biden, 76.

AD

It’s also unclear whether Sanders’s new style is a momentary phenomenon or a lasting transformation. But his aides and allies hope it helps him capi­tal­ize on a crucial moment in the campaign, as the sprint to the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses is heating up.

AD

Beyond the health issues, Democrats ascribe Sanders’s improvement in the polls to several factors: a greater investment in TV ads; the rise of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who may be pulling support from Warren and Biden; and endorsements from marquee Democrats, such as ­Ocasio-Cortez, who have given his campaign a more youthful and diverse feel.

“We don’t watch the polls, we change the polls,” the congresswoman said in impassioned remarks introducing Sanders at a rally here Friday evening. “This is not a movie. This is a movement.”

AD

In addition to honing his pitch for the presidency, Sanders has recently sharpened his attacks on Biden and President Trump. While that is a more aggressive strategy, some aides see it as a reflection of his new willingness to heed their advice instead of insisting on doing things his way.

AD

The campaign is planning to unveil a new TV ad in Iowa castigating Trump for being corrupt, hitting on a theme that Sanders’s allies had long encouraged him to use more often and that Warren has made a staple of her pitch.

Similarly, before the first Democratic debate, there was a push inside the campaign for Sanders to hit Biden hard, but he did not do it, disappointing some officials. In the fourth debate, which marked Sanders’s return to the campaign after his heart attack, he was more pointed in going after the former vice president.

AD

“I don’t think it was like any degree of coaching,” said Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir. “His instincts matched what many of the staff around him were also similarly feeling.”

Shakir traces Sanders’s increased trust in his team back to his hospitalization.

AD

“What he experienced — what he saw — was, ‘Wow, the campaign, even when I was down for a few days, arguably grew even stronger,’ ” said Shakir. “Out of that experience, he’s certainly grown more comfortable giving that space to others.”

The shift also reflects something more fundamental, aides say. Sanders has always rejected the notion of talking about himself or his life, viewing that as a tacky form of campaigning and preferring to emphasize policy.

AD

But the health scare has opened him to the idea of tying the personal to the political. In recent weeks he has spoken publicly about how his heart attack caused him to think about people who don’t have good health insurance, fusing that notion to his pitch to enact a Medicare-for-all system.

The heart attack, of course, also brought greater attention to Sanders’s age, which was already on the minds of many voters. He has responded in part by portraying his age as an asset that highlights his lifelong fight for democratic socialist ideas, rather than a liability that should cause doubt about his ability to serve as president.

AD

He has also found different ways to bring up his age with a lighter touch, sometimes sounding like a Borscht Circuit comedian with his thick Brooklyn accent.

AD

“I would like to thank Pastor Jenkins for his remarks,” Sanders said when he stepped to the lectern at a church in Waterloo, Iowa, earlier this month. “Except he gave my whole speech. Didn’t leave me much to say.”

He added, “I want you to remember he introduced me as the junior senator from Vermont. I don’t want to tell you how old the senior senator is.” (Democrat Patrick J. Leahy, the other senator from Vermont, is 79.)

But there is still unease about Sanders’s health and age. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed just 48 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents feel Sanders is in good enough overall health to serve as president, while nearly as many, 45 percent, said he is not. In contrast, clear majorities said Biden and Warren are in good enough health to serve.

AD

AD

“I think he’s too old,” said Ron Swesey, 71, speaking of Sanders. A retiree who made the short trip across the border to Iowa from Omaha to see Sanders and ­Ocasio-Cortez on Friday, Swesey said he was leaning toward supporting Buttigieg, who is 37.

The Sanders campaign has promised to release his health records by the end of the year. Campaign officials have offered few specifics about his heart attack and have not said how much damage his heart sustained.

Even as he has shown signs of improvement in the polls, some Democrats are skeptical that Sanders is doing more than solidifying his most loyal supporters. While he has drawn large crowds with Ocasio-Cortez, some local Iowa Democratic officials say they have not heard much from the Sanders campaign

“We don’t get an awful lot of interaction from them,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic Party chairman in Polk County, Iowa. “What that tells me is they are really getting their base together from 2016.”

AD

To combat that notion, in Iowa and elsewhere, the Sanders campaign is trying to bring new voters into the fold, betting heavily on a network of volunteers they hope will recruit people with whom they know and interact.

And at big rallies in New York and Minnesota, Sanders has tried a new tactic to foster a more inclusive feel: He urges voters to look to their left and right and ask themselves whether they would fight for the people they see there, even if they have different needs and backgrounds from themselves.

Like several of the Democratic candidates, Sanders is investing significant resources in an effort to post a strong showing in Iowa. Some allies fear that losing to Warren in the state would have a devastating effect on his candidacy.

Overall, Sanders has eased his hectic campaign pace since his heart attack, but he is still holding more events than many of his rivals. Now that he has a bit more downtime, Shakir said, he has made more visits to campaign headquarters and taken more time to talk to his staff there.

“Bernie Sanders just feels better physically,” Shakir said. “And because he feels better, you get the truer version of who he is.”"

Seven months ago, he said he wouldn’t run, and yet here we are.

But again, we should have predicted this happening now. Bloomberg is a billionaire, and the past few weeks have seen a flurry of other billionaires expressing public consternation about the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the polls. One wrote a long, sad-sack letter complaining about her policy proposals and rhetoric. On Wednesday, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates crankily objected to Warren’s tax proposals, suggesting hyperbolically that he’d have to pay $100 billion in taxes — leaving him with only the equivalent of 110,000 years of the median annual household income to subsist on.

There are more esoteric factors at play, too. Bloomberg would be forgiven as well for assuming that if voters were looking for a self-made billionaire with a lot in the bank, he had a lot more to offer on both fronts than the guy in the Oval Office. (The Democrats have a billionaire in the race, Tom Steyer, but he’s not making much of a dent.) Heck, it’s even a boom market for media coverage for former New York mayors. How could he miss?

When Bloomberg was last toying with the idea of running in 2020 and before Steyer jumped in, we raised what seemed at the time like an obvious point: Why do these guys think that the candidate Democratic voters will find most appealing is a white, male plutocrat? We walked through all of the reasons to think that was precisely not what Democrats wanted, given that the party has grown sharply more liberal in recent years and given that the strong 2018 election for the party was powered by nonwhite candidates and women. (Bloomberg’s longtime political adviser Howard Wolfson sought to give Bloomberg some credit for the outcome of that race, noting that Bloomberg had invested $100 million in the outcome.) A poll from Gallup last month found that Democratic voters are more satisfied than usual with the field as it currently stands.

AD

AD

Part of the motivation, certainly, is the self-confidence that comes with having earned more money than one could spend several generations of lifetimes. Some billionaires seem more willing to conflate net worth with personal worth than most people, in case you hadn’t read the news in the past few years.

What’s more, while the Democratic Party of 2019 seems like a weird place for a fairly moderate, pro-business white guy to land, there’s not really anywhere else for him to go. As we’ve noted before, a lot of never-Trump Republicans have grafted themselves onto Democratic political conversations simply because there’s nowhere else to go. What’s a party-fluid guy like Bloomberg going to do, run third-party? Primary Trump?

It’s just … a weird fit. In June, the Associated Press and NORC asked Americans what qualities in a presidential candidate would make them most appealing. The factors that would generate the most excitement. Both overall and among Democrats, the most appealing quality was experience in elected office, which Bloomberg certainly has — although so do most of the other Democratic candidates. In both groups of respondents, three of the least exciting qualities were a candidate who is old (check), one who is white (check) and one who is a man (check).

AD

AD

Incidentally, our saying the 77-year-old Bloomberg is old isn’t our being rude to the former mayor. Bloomberg said that he was “a little bit too old” to run for president.

He said it 22 years ago, on CNN’s “Crossfire.”

He does have one fairly well regarded quality that much of the field doesn’t: that business experience. In the AP-NORC polling, though, a strong business background was seen as more appealing from the electorate on the whole than among Democrats. (On the graph below, dots above the line are traits more popular among Democrats.) A business background was about as appealing to Democrats as a black candidate, and it was quite a bit less appealing than a younger candidate or a woman.

There’s a big asterisk hovering above those results, of course. Democrats may say they aren’t really excited about an old white man as a candidate, but, if so, no one’s told the plurality of the electorate that supports former vice president Joe Biden. Biden has led the field for most of the year, suggesting that an older white guy might just make it after all.

AD

AD

Biden’s poll numbers are predicated heavily on his moderate positions and his support from black Democrats (two groups that overlap significantly). If Bloomberg’s going to make a dent, he’s going to have to eat into Biden’s dominance with that pool of voters.

Which is where Bloomberg’s sketchy history becomes important. It seems pretty unlikely that Bloomberg will peel away much of Biden’s support with black voters, given his advocacy for — and ongoing defense of — stop-and-frisk by New York City’s police department. That policy overwhelmingly targeted nonwhite residents of the city and had no apparent effect on the New York’s violent crime. It’s a policy that Trump has forcefully endorsed, which doesn’t suggest that it’s something Democratic voters will embrace.

There are also questions about Bloomberg’s history with women at his eponymous media company. When harassment allegations from multiple women arose 20 years ago, he called them “out-and-out extortion.” At another point, he claimed that he was being targeted because he was well-known. These assertions might also sound familiar.

AD

AD

I have certainly been wrong about the political chances of New York billionaires seeking federal office before. It’s just hard to see, in this specific case, how a late entry by Bloomberg makes a significant run at Biden. Throwing money at the race only buys you a few percentage points, at least the way Steyer’s throwing it. Battling Biden on his turf may, in fact, increase the odds that Warren is the nominee, given that it’s safe to assume Bloomberg voters will be coming from moderates currently in the field like Biden or South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Why do it? Bloomberg’s past success has probably given him a sense that he can accomplish unlikely things. He probably has some non-billionaire consultants in his proximity who are happy to help him spend a small fortune on a race, a small fortune that for Bloomberg is barely a blip. Why not do it, really, when you’ve got no shortage of self-confidence and dollars?

And who knows? Stranger things have very much happened.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: He’s a “Mad Men” president in a #MeToo world.

President Trump mimicked a Hispanic accent during a meeting in the Oval Office to complain about migrants crossing the southern border, according to a new book by an unnamed author. “We get these women coming in with like seven children,” he allegedly told aides. “They are saying, ‘Oh, please help! My husband left me!’ They are useless. They don’t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something.”

This anecdote comes from “A Warning,” which The Washington Post obtained ahead of its Nov. 19 release. Described only as “a senior official in the Trump administration,” this book is by the same anonymous person who penned the September 2018 New York Times op-ed about resisting the president from the inside.

“I’ve sat and listened in uncomfortable silence as he talks about a woman’s appearance or performance,” the author writes. “He comments on makeup. He makes jokes about weight. He critiques clothing. He questions the toughness of women in and around his orbit. He uses words like ‘sweetie’ and ‘honey’ to address accomplished professionals. This is precisely the way a boss shouldn’t act in the work environment.”

-- White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed the book as “a work of fiction” and issued a blanket denial. “The coward who wrote this book didn’t put their name on it because it is nothing but lies,” Grisham emailed. The president has previously suggested that the person doesn’t exist, but earlier this week the Justice Department warned the author’s agents at Javelin – who both served in the George W. Bush administration – that whomever has written the book may be violating “one or more nondisclosure agreements” by not going through a classification review.

-- Phil Rucker, our White House bureau chief who got ahold of the early copy, describes “A Warning” as a “chilling portrait of the president as cruel, inept and a danger to the nation he was elected to lead.” Among the allegations spread across 259 pages: “Senior Trump administration officials considered resigning en masse last year in a ‘midnight self-massacre’ … but rejected the idea because they believed it would further destabilize an already teetering government … Trump considered presidential pardons as ‘unlimited ''Get Out of Jail Free'' cards on a Monopoly board’ … Trump once asked White House lawyers to draft a bill to send to Congress reducing the number of federal judges. ‘Can we just get rid of the judges? Let’s get rid of the [expletive] judges,’ the president said, according to the book. ‘There shouldn’t be any at all, really.’ …

“The book contains a handful of startling assertions that are not backed up with evidence, such as a claim that if a majority of the Cabinet were prepared to remove Trump from office under the 25th Amendment, Vice President Pence would have been supportive. Pence denied this on Thursday, calling the book ‘appalling,’” Rucker reports. “The author portrays Trump as fearful of coups against him and suspicious of note-takers on his staff. According to the book, the president shouted at an aide who was scribbling in a notebook during a meeting, ‘What the [expletive] are you doing?’ He added, ‘Are you [expletive] taking notes?’ The aide apologized and closed the notebook.”

-- The comments about women attributed to Trump in the book track with a long record of other degrading and inappropriate statements, including to a member of his own Cabinet. The Times reported last month that Trump called then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen “sweetheart” and “honey” during a conversation about securing the U.S.-Mexico border. “Kirstjen, you didn't hear me the first time, honey,” Trump said, two people familiar with the conversation told the Times. “Shoot 'em down. Sweetheart, just shoot 'em out of the sky, O.K.?”

-- Trump has mocked the #MeToo movement and said it’s gone too far. He impersonated and ridiculed professor Christine Blasey Ford after she testified against his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who denied her allegations of sexual asault. Most notoriously, the 73-year-old who has been married three times was caught on a hot mic boasting during a 2005 conversation with “Access Hollywood” personality Billy Bush about grabbing women by the genitals and propositioning married women. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump said.

When the video emerged in October 2016, Trump apologized for what he called “locker-room banter.”

""Nobody has more respect for women than I do,"" the GOP nominee said during a debate with Hillary Clinton. ""Nobody! Nobody has more respect.""

After he got elected, Trump started suggesting without evidence that the video was not authentic. It is.

-- Trump has routinely attacked individual women in harshly personal terms, including with comments about their appearance. Last year, the president referred to Stormy Daniels as “Horseface” on Twitter. She’s the adult-film actress who was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about her allegations that they had an extramarital affair. The year before, he accused MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski of “bleeding badly from a face-lift” when she visited Mar-a-Lago. In 2015, discussing former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, a then-rival for the GOP nomination, Trump told Rolling Stone: “Can you imagine that, the face of our next president? I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?”

He’s also assigned numbers to rate women on their level of physical attractiveness. A few years ago, Trump said supermodel Heidi Klum is no longer a “10.” She responded by posting a photo of herself wearing a shirt that said “10” on it.

-- As president, he has used the word “nasty” to describe many women, from the prime minister of Denmark after she wouldn’t entertain selling Greenland to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Duchess Meghan Markle and Clinton, the former secretary of state.

-- Trump has perpetuated archaic female stereotypes in several of his own books. “There’s nothing I love more than women, but they’re really a lot different than portrayed. They are far worse than men, far more aggressive, and boy, can they be smart,” Trump wrote in “The Art of the Comeback,” which came out in 1997.

“Women have one of the great acts of all time,” he added. “The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers. The person who came up with the expression ‘the weaker sex’ was either very naive or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye — or perhaps another body part.”

He recalled urging a friend with a “nagging” wife, Trump’s word, to file for divorce. “If he doesn’t lose the ballbreaker, his career will go nowhere,” Trump recalled telling the man. “For a man to be successful he needs support at home, just like my father had from my mother, not someone who is always griping and bitching,"" the future president explained. ""When a man has to endure a woman who is not supportive and complains constantly about his not being home enough or not being attentive enough, he will not be very successful unless he is able to cut the cord.”

Trump suggested that his first marriage failed when he allowed his wife to work outside the home: “My big mistake with Ivana was taking her out of the role of wife and allowing her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City, then the Plaza Hotel,” he lamented. “The problem was, work was all she wanted to talk about. When I got home at night, rather than talking about the softer subjects of life, she wanted to tell me how well the Plaza was doing, or what a great day the casino had. … I will never again give a wife responsibility within my business.”

-- Trump continues to be dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct, which he categorically denies. Consider two stories from just this week:

A writer and longtime women’s advice columnist sued the president on Monday for defamation after she claimed he sexually assaulted her more than two decades ago and he responded that she’s “not my type” and “totally lying.” E. Jean Carroll publicly described the alleged assault for the first time in June in a memoir. “At that time and in the new lawsuit, she said that after running into the then-real estate developer at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996, they chatted and shopped together before he attacked her in a dressing room. She said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out,” Beth Reinhard reports. “Carroll is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. … White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Monday called the lawsuit ‘frivolous’ and Carroll ‘a fraud.’”

On Tuesday, phone records emerged in another defamation suit against the president in New York from a second women he called a liar after she accused him of sexual assault. Trump made the calls from his cellphone to a former contestant on “The Apprentice” around the same time that she says he sexually assaulted her. “The excerpts from Trump’s Verizon cellphone bills over a three-month period in 2007 and 2008 show that Trump exchanged calls with Summer Zervos on at least six occasions, including on a day that Trump’s private calendar has shown that he was staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel,” Josh Partlow reports. “That hotel stay is a key part of Zervos’s defamation lawsuit against Trump in New York State Supreme Court. Zervos says that Trump forced himself on her with unwanted kissing and groping while she visited him for lunch in his hotel room.”

-- These cases are likely to drag into 2020 and could become high-profile clouds over the president’s reelection campaign. What’s already been established about Trump’s conduct helps explain why he’s repelled so many college-educated suburban women who have historically voted for Republicans. The consequences of this were on display once again in Tuesday’s off-year elections, the third year in a row that Democrats have made gains in down-ballot races because of this constituency’s distaste for Trump.

-- Two other memorable metaphors about Trump in the new anonymous book are also generating buzz: Discussing his Twitter tirades, the official writes: “It’s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him.” The writer also compares Trump to “a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport.”

-- The Times published a quite negative review of the book last night, criticizing the lack of detailed anecdotes and the unwillingness of the author to attach their name: “How can a book that has been denuded of anything too specific do anything more than pale against a formal whistle-blower complaint? It’s hard to look like a heroic truth teller by comparison, but Anonymous tries very hard,” Jennifer Szalai writes. “Anonymous has seen disturbing things. Anonymous has heard disturbing things. You, the reader, will already recognize most of what Anonymous has seen and heard as revealed in this book if you have been paying any attention to the news. Did you know that the president isn’t much of a reader? That he’s inordinately fond of autocrats? That ‘he stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information’?

“‘A Warning,’ Anonymous says, is intended for a ‘broad audience,’ though to judge by the parade of bland, methodical arguments (Anonymous loves to qualify criticisms with a lawyerly ‘in fairness’), the ideal reader would seem to be an undecided voter who has lived in a cave for the past three years, and is irresistibly moved by quotations from Teddy Roosevelt and solemn invocations of Cicero.”

-- The author preemptively defends the decision to conceal his or her identity: “Some will call this ‘cowardice.’ My feelings are not hurt by the accusation. Nor am I unprepared to attach my name to criticism of President Trump. I may do so, in due course.”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg is making plans to enter the Democratic presidential primary campaign this week. Matt Viser and Michael Scherer report: “Bloomberg, who as one of the world’s richest men would bring significant financial resources to his own campaign but also inflame the populist wing of the party, plans to file paperwork and has dispatched staff to Alabama to ensure he can get onto the ballot in a state that has a Friday filing deadline. He has been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans and could make an announcement as early as next week.""

This should be read as a rebuke of Joe Biden's flailing campaign that reflects rising fear among centrist plutocrats of Elizabeth Warren: ""One of the driving reasons Bloomberg decided against joining the race earlier this year — he announced his decision seven weeks before Biden entered — was his view that Biden was too formidable a contender. But in the months since, Biden has been underwhelming, remaining among the race’s leaders but halting in his debate performances and stumbling over raising the tens of millions necessary to mount a strong campaign. … Bloomberg, 77, has been outspoken in his opposition to Warren’s and [Bernie] Sanders’s intentions to raise taxes on the extremely wealthy like himself, and on Thursday they returned the ill sentiments. ... 'Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg!' Warren tweeted, providing a link to the impacts her policies would have on billionaires.""

It is still possible that Bloomberg won't ultimately enter the race, but he is taking steps to ensure he will be on the ballot: “The Democratic field has winnowed recently from two dozen to 16, but Bloomberg’s decision could also open the door to other announcements. Former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. has not ruled out a possible entry, nor has … Hillary Clinton. Oprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama, has repeatedly begged Disney chief executive Bob Iger to jump into the race, but he has so far been unwilling.”

An unorthodox strategy: “Bloomberg has decided not to raise money for his bid if he does move forward, which would preclude him from entry in the Democratic debates under rules that require a growing number of donors to qualify. … It is also possible that he decides to skip the first four voting states … and place far more emphasis on the Super Tuesday contests of March 3, when the race will become more nationalized — and more expensive.”

-- In related billionaire-for-president news: A top aide to Tom Steyer has been privately offering campaign contributions to local politicians in Iowa in exchange for endorsing Steyer’s bid, the AP reports. “The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Steyer’s Iowa campaign, aren’t illegal — though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There’s no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer’s campaign as compensation for their backing. But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer’s campaign would think he could purchase their support.”

THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:

-- The House GOP's emerging plan to save Trump is to blame three of his deputies: E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Rudy Giuliani and, possibly, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Karoun Demijrian and Rachael Bade report: “As Republicans argue that most of the testimony against Trump is based on faulty secondhand information, they are sowing doubts about whether Sondland, Giuliani and Mulvaney were actually representing the president or freelancing to pursue their own agendas. The GOP is effectively offering up the three to be fall guys. … Their evolving strategy comes as House Democrats settle on their argument that Trump tried to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to undertake two politically advantageous investigations as a precondition for U.S. military aid and a White House meeting between the two heads of state. … Republicans, however, face several potential problems if they try to pin a quid pro quo on Sondland alone. Sondland testified that he was ‘assuming’ Giuliani was speaking for Trump when he said the president wanted Zelensky to investigate the Ukrainian energy company Burisma … But while Giuliani is Trump’s personal lawyer, GOP lawmakers appear to think they can argue he was not coordinating his actions with the president.""

-- House investigators subpoenaed Mulvaney to testify today, but he is not expected to appear. (AP)

-- Trump’s demands for Ukraine came down to three words -- “Investigations, Biden and Clinton” – according to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who oversaw Ukraine policy. The transcript of his deposition, published yesterday afternoon, lays out in perhaps the starkest terms to date Trump’s shadow efforts to coerce Ukraine’s leadership to open investigations that would benefit him politically, Greg Jaffe and Mike DeBonis report: “Trump ‘wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to a microphone and say investigations, Biden and Clinton,’ Kent told House impeachment investigators. Kent’s assessment came from a summary of a conversation that Trump had with [Sondland]. The senior diplomat … also blasted [Giuliani], whom he described as waging a ‘campaign of lies’ aimed at the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.""

-- Kent and acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor are expected to testify publicly next Wednesday. To get a taste of what to expect, read the full transcript of Kent’s deposition here.

-- Previewing his messaging plans, Trump tweeted that Joe and Hunter Biden ""must testify"" as part of the impeachment proceedings.

-- Adding to the intrigue: Kent also testified that Republican Sens. Jim Inhofe (Okla.), Robert Portman (Ohio) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.) called Trump to ask him directly about his hold on Ukraine aid before it was lifted. (Politico)

-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied discussing the ousting of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch with his former senior adviser Michael McKinley, who told investigators last month he asked Pompeo about the issue. John Hudson reports: “‘When Ambassador Yovanovitch returned to the U.S., he didn’t raise that issue with me,’ Pompeo said Thursday. He added that because McKinley’s focus wasn’t Ukraine ‘it shouldn’t surprise anyone that in May when that took place, he didn’t say a thing to me.’ McKinley testified that in September, after the administration released [the July 25 rough transcript], he pushed for the State Department to defend Yovanovitch by issuing a statement [in support of her]. … McKinley said in his testimony that he wanted a statement to underscore Yovanovitch’s ‘professionalism and courage.’ Pompeo decided against it, McKinley told impeachment investigators, saying he did not want to ‘draw undue attention to her.’”

-- The position of U.S. special envoy to Ukraine will probably be scrapped. It was formerly held by Kurt Volker, the first senior official to step down in the impeachment inquiry. From Foreign Policy: “The responsibilities of Volker’s role are expected to be taken up by other State Department officials whose portfolios include Ukraine. The demise of the special envoy post, which was part-time and unpaid, is one of the first tangible signs that fallout from the impeachment probe has left a lasting impact on U.S. policy toward Ukraine…The move leaves Kyiv without a clearly designated U.S. diplomat to watch its back in talks as [Zelensky] pushes for peace five years into a simmering war in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that has killed more than 13,000 people. … Current and former officials say the position will likely be scrapped in large part because the administration would be hard-pressed to find someone to fill the role given how fraught working on Ukraine policy has become.”

-- A star witness in the trial of former Trump confidant Roger Stone took the stand, cracking jokes and offering to do impressions while starkly contradicting Stone’s testimony to Congress about efforts to learn about Democratic emails hacked by Russia. Rachel Weiner, Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report: “Former radio host Randy Credico told jurors that — contrary to what Stone told lawmakers — he was not Stone’s secret back channel to the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, which published the emails that authorities say were hacked and ultimately released to benefit Trump’s campaign. … Prosecutors sought to prove to jurors that Stone had lied and obstructed — comparing documentary evidence to Stone’s recorded words to the House committee, and displaying inflammatory messages that Stone sent to Credico. ‘You are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends,’ Stone wrote in April 2018, adding later, ‘I am so ready. Let’s get it on. Prepare to die. . . .’ As Credico testified, Stone, 67, stared impassively at him — at times tilting his head back, and resting his right elbow at the defense table.”

-- Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones threatened on his radio show to name someone he believes to be a juror in the Stone trial. That might be jury tampering. Deanna Paul reports: “Jones broadcast on his show the name and face of an individual whom he believed had been seated on Stone’s jury, calling the person an anti-Trump ‘minion’ and launching a flurry of witness tampering and obstruction of justice allegations. Although Jones held up a photo of a person who had no connection to the Stone trial, legal experts maintained the effect was the same as if the person had been a juror. … It doesn’t matter whether he revealed the right or wrong name or image, according to Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. His actions were not about a particular juror, but rather they were aimed at intimidating the others on the jury, she said.”

-- A federal judge slammed Trump for repeatedly attacking and insulting judges he dislikes. Katie Shepherd reports: “U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman of the District of Columbia said Trump’s rhetoric ‘violates all recognized democratic norms’ during a speech at the annual Judge Thomas A. Flannery Lecture in Washington on Wednesday. ‘We are in unchartered territory,’ said Friedman, 75, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. ‘We are witnessing a chief executive who criticizes virtually every judicial decision that doesn’t go his way and denigrates judges who rule against him, sometimes in very personal terms. He seems to view the courts and the justice system as obstacles to be attacked and undermined, not as a coequal branch to be respected even when he disagrees with its decisions.’ … Other judges have raised similar concerns about Trump’s rhetoric and the increasingly partisan interpretation of judicial rulings, but as a senior judge and secretary of the American Law Institute, Friedman’s criticism carries weight.”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- A New York judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million in damages for misusing funds from his tax-exempt charity. David Fahrenthold and Joshua Partlow report: Trump took “the charity’s money to pay debts for his for-profit businesses, to boost his 2016 campaign and to buy a painting of himself, according to court documents. That order, from state Judge Saliann Scarpulla, settled a lawsuit filed against Trump last year by the New York attorney general. It marked an extraordinary moment: The president of the United States acknowledged in a court filing that he had failed to follow basic laws about how charities should be governed. Previously, Trump had insisted the charity was run properly and the suit was a partisan sham. … But in a statement tweeted out late Thursday, Trump seemed to play down the settlement he had just agreed to — saying, in spite of the failures he had just acknowledged, that the foundation’s money was spent properly and the lawsuit was politically motivated. … The June 2018 lawsuit … alleged ‘persistently illegal conduct’ at the Donald J. Trump Foundation …

“As part of the settlement, Trump also agreed to disburse the $1.8 million remaining in the foundation to a set of charities, and to shutter it for good. In a statement signed by Trump’s attorney, the president admitted to poor oversight of the charity. … The president [agreed] to submit to extra monitoring of any future charitable activities in New York. … If Trump does ever join a charity board — or starts a new charity of his own — the charity must fill a majority of board seats with people who have no relationship to Trump. It also must hire a qualified attorney, submit to audits and agree never to pay Trump or his company for any services. … Trump’s three eldest children — Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric — were also named in the original lawsuit, because they were listed as board members at the foundation. In reality, the board did not meet at all for 19 straight years, from 1999 to 2018. The three Trump children were required to take an ‘in-person interactive’ training class in how to be better board members, and the suit against them was dismissed, court documents say.”

-- My take: This settlement makes Trump much more likely to house his future presidential library and foundation in Florida, rather than New York, where he'd now face much more onerous oversight burdens. The president also recently changed his residency from the Empire State to the Sunshine State.

-- Ivanka Trump, who works in the White House, accused the Bidens of creating “wealth as a derivative” of public service, while her family made money with their businesses before her father became president. In an interview with the AP that just posted, she also said the identity of the whistleblower is “not particularly relevant.” She insisted she hasn’t been involved in discussions about the possible sale of the president’s Washington hotel. She led the acquisition and development of the hotel a few blocks from the White House.

-- The president vs. the presidency: Trump likes to boast that his landmark First Step Act has freed more than 3,000 inmates, but his own people at the Justice Department are trying to send many of them back to prison. Neena Satija, Wesley Lowery and Josh Dawsey report: “The five former inmates assembled on the White House stage weren’t scheduled to speak, but President Trump couldn’t help himself. … From behind the president, Gregory Allen saluted and then made his way to the microphone. ‘Two months ago, I was in a prison cell, and I’m in the White House,’ declared Allen, a Florida resident who had been freed under Trump’s signature criminal justice legislation. The gathering in April was a triumphant celebration of the First Step Act, the most sweeping overhaul of the federal criminal justice system in a generation. Since its passage nearly a year ago, the law has led to the release of more than 3,000 inmates — including Allen, who was convicted of cocaine trafficking in 2001.

“The Justice Department, though, had never wanted to let Allen out of prison. In fact, even as he and Trump shared a joyous embrace on television, federal prosecutors were trying to persuade a judge to put Allen back behind bars. … Neither the advocates who organized the April 1 event nor White House staff were aware that federal prosecutors had already notified the court that they would seek to reincarcerate him … Two weeks after local newscasts led the evening news with images of Allen smiling and embracing the president, the former inmate got another phone call: The government was dropping its appeal. Allen never received a formal explanation of why prosecutors changed course. But he gave The Post his theory: ‘Once they saw they gave me a presidential invite, they had to rethink things.’""

What's the rub? “The First Step Act aims to lessen long-standing disparities in punishment for nonviolent drug offenses involving crack cocaine. … But federal prosecutors are arguing in hundreds of cases that inmates who have applied for this type of relief are ineligible, according to a review of court records and interviews with defense attorneys. In at least half a dozen cases, prosecutors are seeking to reincarcerate offenders who have been released under the First Step Act. The department has told federal prosecutors that when determining whether to challenge an application for early release, they should consider not the amount of crack an inmate was convicted of having or trafficking — but rather the amount that court records suggest they may have actually had, which is often much larger. …

“In the vast majority of cases reviewed by The Washington Post, judges have disagreed with the Justice Department’s interpretation. Some of the people involved in writing the legislation also disagree, including Brett Tolman, a former U.S. attorney in Utah. He and other supporters of the law note that the text of the legislation does not explicitly instruct courts to consider the actual amount of crack an offender allegedly had. ‘This is not a faithful implementation of this part of the First Step Act,’ said Tolman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.”

-- Environmental Protection Agency officials are in a standoff with the agency’s independent watchdog over a probe of a top EPA official’s attempts to influence a scientist ahead of her congressional testimony. Juliet Eilperin reports: “In a letter released publicly Wednesday, acting EPA inspector general Charles J. Sheehan informed Congress that his office had encountered a ‘flagrant problem’ in light of [EPA chief of staff Ryan] Jackson’s refusal to cooperate with an ongoing audit and investigation focused on his activities while in office. ‘To countenance open defiance even in one instance — much less two, both by a senior official setting precedent for himself and all agency staff — is ruinous,’ Sheehan wrote. Agency officials have pushed back at the accusations, arguing that they had sought to accommodate the IG’s requests.”

-- The IG is also asking witnesses whether Jackson has routinely destroyed politically sensitive documents, Politico reports.

-- Senior aides at the Commerce Department forced NOAA to publicly rebuke its weather forecasters in Birmingham, Ala., for contradicting Trump’s comments about the threat Hurricane Dorian posed there. Jason Samenow and Andrew Freedman report: “According to emails released via a Freedom of Information Act request from The Post and other news organizations, Julie Kay Roberts, NOAA’s deputy chief of staff and communications director, was told on Sept. 2 about the motivation behind a tweet that the National Weather Service office in Birmingham had sent at 11:11 a.m. the day before. When forecasters there tweeted that ‘Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,’ they were responding to an influx of calls from worried residents and not to an earlier tweet from Trump. Trump had wrongly tweeted at 10:51 a.m. the same day that Alabama would ‘most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated,’ sparking confusion and fear in the state. … ‘I wanted to let you know that the forecasters in Birmingham who made the clarification post for Alabama [were] unaware of the POTUS tweet when they made their post,’ Susan Buchanan, director of public affairs for the National Weather Service, wrote to Weather Service and NOAA officials.”

-- JBS, a Brazilian company that is the largest meat producer in the world, has received $78 million as part of Trump's $16 billion bailout meant for farmers getting crushed because of his trade war. That’s more than any domestic pork producer. Kimberly Kindy reports: “JBS’s winning hand in securing a quarter of all of the pork bailout contracts is one example of the power a small number of multinational meat companies now hold in the United States. JBS has become a major player in the United States even as it faces price-fixing and other investigations from the federal government. … A dozen years ago, JBS did not own a single U.S. meat plant. Today, JBS and three other food companies control about 85 percent of beef production. … JBS said in a written statement that its American subsidiary, JBS USA, is a vital part of the agricultural economy. The company employs more than 60,000 people in the United States and buys from more than 11,000 U.S. farmers and ranchers. ...

""Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) recently challenged whether JBS’s entry into the U.S. market should have been allowed. Corruption scandals have engulfed JBS in Brazil, the senators wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and company officials have ‘admitted criminal conduct to secure loans that were used for investment in the United States.’ They’ve asked for a review of the purchases.”

-- A new chain of Christian pregnancy centers will provide contraception. Sarah Puliiam Bailey reports: “Eight independent Texas-based pregnancy centers merged earlier this year to form a chain called The Source. With Christian women’s health centers in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, the nonprofit organization plans to offer a full array of medical services, to include testing for sexually transmitted diseases, first-trimester prenatal care and contraception choices. … Planned Parenthood announced in August its plans to forgo about $60 million in Title X family planning funds rather than comply with new Trump administration rules ... Now the Source group, which will not refer patients for abortion, plans to vie for the money in 2020. The decision to provide contraception is a huge cultural shift for Christian centers that, for religious reasons, do not normally offer birth control. But it represents what some in the antiabortion movement say is a much-needed rebranding for pregnancy centers.”

-- Walgreens handled nearly one in five of the most addictive opioids at the height of the epidemic. Jenn Abelson, Aaron Williams, Andrew Ba Tran and Meryl Kornfield report: “Walgreens dominated the nation’s retail opioid market from 2006 through 2012, buying about 13 billion pills — 3 billion more than CVS, its closest competitor, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration database of opioid shipments. Over those years, Walgreens more than doubled its purchases of oxycodone. The company had ‘runaway growth’ of oxycodone sales because it continued to send pills to stores ‘without limit or review,’ Edward Bratton, Walgreens manager of pharmaceutical integrity, wrote to another employee in 2013. The email is among thousands of documents recently disclosed in a federal lawsuit that seeks to hold Walgreens and other businesses responsible for the nation’s opioid crisis. … By acting as its own distributor, Walgreens took on the responsibility of alerting the DEA to suspicious orders by its own pharmacies and stopping those shipments. Instead, about 2,400 cities and counties nationwide allege that Walgreens failed to report signs of diversion and incentivized pharmacists with bonuses to fill more prescriptions of highly addictive opioids.”

-- Bernie Sanders released his immigration plan, which would give undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years the chance to stay without the risk of deportation. From the Times: “[He] called for ending virtually all of the Trump administration’s immigration policies and creating a ‘swift, fair pathway to citizenship’ for undocumented immigrants … If elected, Mr. Sanders would, on his first day in office, place a moratorium on all deportations until his administration conducted a ‘thorough audit of current and past practices and policies,’ his campaign said. And he would seek to restructure the Department of Homeland Security, reassigning responsibilities for border enforcement, naturalization and citizenship and customs authority to other cabinet agencies. In doing so, he would ‘break up’ Immigrations and Customs Enforcement … splitting its responsibilities between the Justice and State Departments. … He also said he would decriminalize unauthorized border crossings, making them a civil offense, an idea pushed by Julián Castro.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Iran barred the U.N. nuclear inspector from entering a uranium-enrichment plant after Iranian officials said she tested positive for explosive nitrates. Erin Cunningham and Steve Hendrix report: “The move drew condemnation from the United States, which called Iran’s decision to expel the inspector an ‘outrageous provocation.’ A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, confirmed that one of its inspectors was ‘temporarily prevented from leaving Iran’ last week. … According to Iranian officials, the inspector was halted by security at the gate of Iran’s main enrichment plant in Natanz after triggering an alarm. The alert raised officials’ concerns she was carrying ‘suspicious material.’ … ‘We repeated the [security] process with different detectors and also her suitcase, and the alarms went off every time,’ Kazem Gharbabadi, Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, said in an interview Thursday with Iranian state television.”

-- The top American diplomat in northern Syria said the Trump administration didn’t do enough to prevent Turkey’s military offensive and said Turkish-backed military fighters committed “war crimes and ethnic cleansing.” From the Times: “In a searing internal memo, the diplomat, William V. Roebuck, raised the question of whether tougher American diplomacy, blunter threats of economic sanctions and increased military patrols could have deterred Turkey from attacking. Similar measures had dissuaded Turkish military action before. ‘It’s a tough call, and the answer is probably not,’ Mr. Roebuck wrote in the 3,200-word memo. ‘But we won’t know because we didn’t try.’ He did note several reasons the Turks might not have been deterred: the small American military presence at two border outposts, Turkey’s decades-long standing as a NATO ally and its formidable army massing at the Syrian frontier.”

-- French President Emmanuel Macron told the Economist that NATO has suffered “brain death.” Adam Taylor reports: “‘What will Article 5 mean tomorrow?’ the French leader said in an interview with the Economist, referring to the article of the North Atlantic Treaty on collective defense. ‘If the Bashar al-Assad regime [in Syria] decides to retaliate against Turkey, will we commit ourselves under it? It’s a crucial question.’ Macron’s comments are among the most pessimistic made by a leader of a European NATO power in recent years. They follow years of criticism of NATO by [Trump]. … The remarks drew a rebuke Thursday afternoon in Berlin, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the French president had used ‘drastic words’ that did not reflect her view. ‘NATO remains a cornerstone of our security,’ Merkel said at a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who emphasized the need for unity in the alliance. Some analysts warned that although Macron may be trying to rally European allies with his remarks, his comments could backfire.”

-- Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, children of a united Germany remain divided. Loveday Morris and Luisa Beck report: “Events celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall’s demise this week are tempered by soul-searching about continued rifts in society. Although economic divisions between East and West have narrowed, the East still lags behind. And political and psychological divisions, which until recent years had been written off by some politicians as issues of the past, have become increasingly obvious. That’s especially the case within the generation raised after reunification and without memory of the communist state that preceded it. Only 38 percent of East Germans think reunification succeeded, according to a government report released in September. That drops to 20 percent among those younger than 40, who experienced East Germany only as children or not at all.”

-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s party could break Israel’s political deadlock by dumping him. But it likely won’t. Ruth Eglash reports: “Such a rebellion has never happened in Likud’s long history, and there is little talk of one now. … [Former military chief and Netanyahu rival Benny] Gantz has less than two weeks left to pull together a coalition in parliament and says he’s willing, even prefers, to join forces with Likud, but he has also made very clear his reluctance to sit in government with a leader facing criminal indictment. If Gantz falls short, Israel could be headed back to a third national election in less than a year. … There are subtle signs Netanyahu’s position is weakening. Present and former Likudniks — as members are known in Hebrew — are beginning to express disillusionment with the direction he is taking the party and asking why he’s still there after a year of failures.”

-- A Hong Kong student died following a police operation, provoking a new wave of anger among protesters. Casey Quackenbush reports: “Chow Tsz-lok, a computer science student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, had been in a coma since early Monday, when he fell one story in a parking lot in the Tseung Kwan O neighborhood while police officers were dispersing protesters nearby. The 22-year-old died shortly after 8 a.m. Friday, the city’s Hospital Authority said. Chow’s death could be the first directly connected to police confrontation with protesters, but the details of what exactly happened in the lead-up to the fall are not clear. … The development quickly ignited the city’s pro-democracy movement. By Friday afternoon, crowds of black-clad people began gathering across the city to commemorate Chow’s death, with marchers brandishing signs denouncing the police, bearing white flowers, and calling for revenge.”

-- Newly published diplomatic cables show that the U.S. ambassadors to El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras asked administration officials to abandon plans to send hundreds of thousands of migrants back to their home countries. From the AP: “As the Trump administration in its early days tried to push through hardline immigration policies, it appeared to calculate their possible impact on the 2020 presidential race while rejecting national security warnings from U.S. diplomats, according to State Department memos … The apparent injection of electoral politics in what was supposed to be a policy decision about humanitarian protections for migrants from some of the Western Hemisphere’s poorest and most violent countries came from then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s policy planning staff.”

-- Mourners flooded the small fundamentalist Mormon community in Northern Mexico for the first funerals after the massacre that left nine dead. Kevin Sieff reports: “The first caskets carried Dawna Langford, 43, and her sons Trevor, 11, and Rogan, 2. Family members wept as they delivered their eulogies. … Hundreds of mourners, many of them family, streamed into this town settled in the 1950s by American fundamentalist Mormons for the first of the services, held in Langford’s backyard. … In eulogy after eulogy, mourners spoke of La Mora and other nearby Mormon communities as one large extended family, members now leaning on each other as they mourn their losses and face the uncertainty of what comes next.”

Donald Trump Jr. writes in his new book that visiting Arlington National Cemetery with his father to lay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns reminded him of his family’s sacrifices. “I rarely get emotional, if ever,” Trump Jr. writes in the book, “Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.” “In that moment, I also thought of all the attacks we’d already suffered as a family, and about all the sacrifices we’d have to make to help my father succeed — voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were ‘profiting off the office,’” Trump Jr. explained.

In Concord, Biden offered gracious words for Bloomberg after filing for next year’s primary but left no doubt he’s ready for the competition: “Michael’s a solid guy and let’s see where it goes. I have no problems with him being in the race.” He was quick to add, “The last polls I looked at, I’m pretty far ahead.

Buttigieg, in a brief Saturday morning interview before continuing his bus tour of the state, said the voters he’s been talking to are in the process of looking at the existing field and trying to narrow it down, albeit they are focused on “which one of us is best to beat Donald Trump.” As for a hunger for someone new to join the race, Buttigieg said, “That’s not something I’ve heard from voters.”

All the early reactions might be premature, given the fluidity in the Democratic race. Bloomberg’s apparent decision to run for president has for now sharpened the discussion about the qualities of the current candidates and the party’s prospects in November 2020.

AD

AD

A Bloomberg entry is seen both as a vote of no confidence in Biden and as evidence that the donor wing of the party, or the moderate wing of the party, or the establishment wing of the party is truly terrified that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has gained the upper hand in the nomination contest.

The unsettled nature of the Democratic nomination campaign has left many Democrats wondering whether any of their candidates can go the distance. That’s the ground on which Bloomberg is building his candidacy — the deep-seated fear that Trump, for all his problems, may be more than equal to the task of winning a second term.

At the same time, many Democrats with long experience in presidential politics are baffled by Bloomberg’s decision. Oh, they know he has long wanted to be president, that he looked at it seriously in several recent cycles, only to pull back and conclude that he couldn’t win, and for Bloomberg, winning is the thing he wants.

AD

AD

Almost every attribute Bloomberg brings to the campaign is already spoken for by the current field. A mayor? There’s Buttigieg or former Newark mayor Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro. A moderate? Well, there’s Biden and Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and . . .

He’s a billionaire willing to spend a fortune. So is Tom Steyer. He is a septuagenarian, if people are looking for older candidates, but so are Biden, Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). He’s a successful business executive. Andrew Yang is a business success as well.

One of Bloomberg’s signature issues that might appeal to the Democratic base is gun control. Former congressman Beto O’Rourke made that his signature issue after the horrific mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, calling for mandatory confiscation of assault weapons. He dropped out a week ago. Another of Bloomberg’s issues is climate change. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington based his whole campaign on that issue and he lasted only a few months before quitting the race.

AD

AD

Still, there is something about Bloomberg that draws outsized attention, and for reasons that go beyond his willingness to spend perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign. He does have a record success in business and in politics. He is admired for his competence and his leadership (and his philanthropy) by fellow mayors who have worked with him over the years.

Other Democrats are indebted to him for the money he has invested in campaigns. He has spent freely to push for action on climate change and to promote gun control legislation, including the dollars he poured into Virginia legislative races this fall that helped Democrats neutralize the National Rifle Association in the state where the NRA is headquartered.

Still, Democrats are puzzled by his decision, wondering just how and why he thinks that, at this relatively late date, he believes he can mount a successful campaign. They acknowledge that the team around him includes smart, tough, shrewd people. They know that Bloomberg and his team are data driven and will make decisions based on their best reading of what the numbers tell them.

AD

AD

They know that his money is a huge asset, even if he is attacked by Sanders and Warren for trying to buy an election. Warren responded to his entry with a welcome and an online calculator to show how much her wealth tax could cost Bloomberg. The answer: about $6 billion.

Bloomberg won’t run a conventional campaign. Beyond that, he’s looking to defy the odds in many ways. For example, nobody has gotten in this late and won. Retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who many Democrats thought had exactly the right attributes to take down then-President George W. Bush, tried a late entry in the early fall of 2003 and flopped.

Former senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee jumped into the 2008 Republican nomination campaign in the early fall of 2007. Some Republicans thought he was the new Ronald Reagan. Instead, with minimal effort, he got nowhere.

AD

AD

When he was Texas’s governor, Rick Perry waited until late summer of 2011 to announce his bid for the GOP nomination. The campaign of Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee, set out to destroy his candidacy and succeeded within a few months.

Bloomberg plans to defy conventions in another way. He apparently has decided not to compete seriously in any of the four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina (although it is not yet clear whether he will seek to qualify for the ballots in those states).

The Democratic Party chairs of Iowa and New Hampshire issued statements late Friday lamenting Bloomberg’s decision to bypass their events.

AD

New Hampshire’s Ray Buckley said: “We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn’t run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states.”

AD

Iowa’s Troy Price said: “Iowa is one of the last places where retail politics and grass-roots organizing run strong, and our process — along with the other early states — makes candidates and their campaigns better prepared for a general election fight.”

Those two Democrats have particular concerns about the Bloomberg strategy. If successful, it could render the Iowa-New Hampshire hegemony at the front of the nominating process moot, something politicians in other states would be happy to see. But skipping the early states would mean Bloomberg could run for the nomination and rarely expose himself to direct questioning from voters.

AD

Bloomberg is certainly taking a risk by skipping the early states. Rudolph W. Giuliani, another former New York mayor, tried essentially that same strategy in 2008. He led the polls among Republicans for much of 2007 but never settled on how he wanted to navigate Iowa or New Hampshire. Instead, he pointed to Florida as his breakout state. With poor showings earlier, however, he had no momentum by the time of Florida. His candidacy sank there.

AD

The 2020 calendar offers Bloomberg an option this time to try again. Super Tuesday comes days after the South Carolina primary, and it will be one of the biggest single delegate hauls in history. It could also cost a fortune to compete widely. Democrats who know the financial demands of these kinds of events say it could cost $100 million to mount a television campaign across that many states, which include California and Texas.

Another Democrat who has been through the recent cycles offered this cautionary note about the value of TV ads. Presidential nominations are not won simply with blanket television advertising. It’s much more about winning begetting winning and building on free media — which is to say the news coverage and the narratives that coverage produces."

Nearly six weeks after suffering a heart attack that pushed his campaign to its lowest point, the famously grumpy U.S. senator from Vermont has reemerged as a more easygoing figure, sprinkling more humor into his policy-centric speeches and opening up about his age, immigrant roots and upbringing — topics he has long resisted emphasizing, despite repeated pleas by his aides.

AD

Sanders is also different in private, according to people who have spoken with him. A candidate with a reputation for sometimes stubbornly disregarding advice and assistance, Sanders is suddenly putting more faith in his brain trust, according to campaign officials, a shift his campaign manager attributes to a moment of clarity when he was hospitalized.

The changes underline one of the most remarkable political recoveries of recent years. In the days after his Oct. 1 heart attack, Sanders’s medical status was unclear and his confidants wondered whether his already struggling campaign would continue. Now, he is performing better in the polls than before his health scare.

AD

“It was a profound moment in his life,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign. “I think he’s sort of liberated from any of the traditional weight of the campaign, and he’s just campaigning now as the Bernie Sanders you see in private.”

AD

The senator’s rebound has reignited his battle for the Democratic Party’s liberal faction with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who a few weeks ago appeared on the verge of consolidating its support. Their renewed rivalry is part of the ongoing turbulence in the Democratic race, which has tightened in recent weeks and could grow to include former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Still, there is no denying the challenges the health scare continues to pose for Sanders, who is the oldest candidate in the race. Polls show Democratic voters are much more concerned about his age and health than they are about his two septuagenarian rivals, Warren, 70, and former vice president Joe Biden, 76.

AD

It’s also unclear whether Sanders’s new style is a momentary phenomenon or a lasting transformation. But his aides and allies hope it helps him capi­tal­ize on a crucial moment in the campaign, as the sprint to the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses is heating up.

AD

Beyond the health issues, Democrats ascribe Sanders’s improvement in the polls to several factors: a greater investment in TV ads; the rise of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who may be pulling support from Warren and Biden; and endorsements from marquee Democrats, such as ­Ocasio-Cortez, who have given his campaign a more youthful and diverse feel.

“We don’t watch the polls, we change the polls,” the congresswoman said in impassioned remarks introducing Sanders at a rally here Friday evening. “This is not a movie. This is a movement.”

AD

In addition to honing his pitch for the presidency, Sanders has recently sharpened his attacks on Biden and President Trump. While that is a more aggressive strategy, some aides see it as a reflection of his new willingness to heed their advice instead of insisting on doing things his way.

AD

The campaign is planning to unveil a new TV ad in Iowa castigating Trump for being corrupt, hitting on a theme that Sanders’s allies had long encouraged him to use more often and that Warren has made a staple of her pitch.

Similarly, before the first Democratic debate, there was a push inside the campaign for Sanders to hit Biden hard, but he did not do it, disappointing some officials. In the fourth debate, which marked Sanders’s return to the campaign after his heart attack, he was more pointed in going after the former vice president.

AD

“I don’t think it was like any degree of coaching,” said Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir. “His instincts matched what many of the staff around him were also similarly feeling.”

Shakir traces Sanders’s increased trust in his team back to his hospitalization.

AD

“What he experienced — what he saw — was, ‘Wow, the campaign, even when I was down for a few days, arguably grew even stronger,’ ” said Shakir. “Out of that experience, he’s certainly grown more comfortable giving that space to others.”

The shift also reflects something more fundamental, aides say. Sanders has always rejected the notion of talking about himself or his life, viewing that as a tacky form of campaigning and preferring to emphasize policy.

AD

But the health scare has opened him to the idea of tying the personal to the political. In recent weeks he has spoken publicly about how his heart attack caused him to think about people who don’t have good health insurance, fusing that notion to his pitch to enact a Medicare-for-all system.

The heart attack, of course, also brought greater attention to Sanders’s age, which was already on the minds of many voters. He has responded in part by portraying his age as an asset that highlights his lifelong fight for democratic socialist ideas, rather than a liability that should cause doubt about his ability to serve as president.

AD

He has also found different ways to bring up his age with a lighter touch, sometimes sounding like a Borscht Circuit comedian with his thick Brooklyn accent.

AD

“I would like to thank Pastor Jenkins for his remarks,” Sanders said when he stepped to the lectern at a church in Waterloo, Iowa, earlier this month. “Except he gave my whole speech. Didn’t leave me much to say.”

He added, “I want you to remember he introduced me as the junior senator from Vermont. I don’t want to tell you how old the senior senator is.” (Democrat Patrick J. Leahy, the other senator from Vermont, is 79.)

But there is still unease about Sanders’s health and age. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed just 48 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents feel Sanders is in good enough overall health to serve as president, while nearly as many, 45 percent, said he is not. In contrast, clear majorities said Biden and Warren are in good enough health to serve.

AD

AD

“I think he’s too old,” said Ron Swesey, 71, speaking of Sanders. A retiree who made the short trip across the border to Iowa from Omaha to see Sanders and ­Ocasio-Cortez on Friday, Swesey said he was leaning toward supporting Buttigieg, who is 37.

The Sanders campaign has promised to release his health records by the end of the year. Campaign officials have offered few specifics about his heart attack and have not said how much damage his heart sustained.

Even as he has shown signs of improvement in the polls, some Democrats are skeptical that Sanders is doing more than solidifying his most loyal supporters. While he has drawn large crowds with Ocasio-Cortez, some local Iowa Democratic officials say they have not heard much from the Sanders campaign

“We don’t get an awful lot of interaction from them,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic Party chairman in Polk County, Iowa. “What that tells me is they are really getting their base together from 2016.”

AD

To combat that notion, in Iowa and elsewhere, the Sanders campaign is trying to bring new voters into the fold, betting heavily on a network of volunteers they hope will recruit people with whom they know and interact.

And at big rallies in New York and Minnesota, Sanders has tried a new tactic to foster a more inclusive feel: He urges voters to look to their left and right and ask themselves whether they would fight for the people they see there, even if they have different needs and backgrounds from themselves.

Like several of the Democratic candidates, Sanders is investing significant resources in an effort to post a strong showing in Iowa. Some allies fear that losing to Warren in the state would have a devastating effect on his candidacy.

Overall, Sanders has eased his hectic campaign pace since his heart attack, but he is still holding more events than many of his rivals. Now that he has a bit more downtime, Shakir said, he has made more visits to campaign headquarters and taken more time to talk to his staff there.

“Bernie Sanders just feels better physically,” Shakir said. “And because he feels better, you get the truer version of who he is.”"

“Online advertising lowers the cost and the barriers to entry,” Fowler said, in part because advertisers can pay for specific impressions rather than having to display ads to an entire local television audience, which may exceed a particular electoral district, creating unnecessary costs.

That targeting ability was critical to Democrat Rui Xu, who won election to the Kansas House of Representatives last year. He attributes his victory in part to his advertising campaign on Facebook.

“I really, really honed my messaging on Facebook,” said Xu, 30, who used the platform’s microtargeting tools, in combination with a list of voters in the district, to reach specific users. He spent an estimated $2,500 on the platform — and nothing on television.

AD

Other candidates in Kansas seeking to replicate his success next year and give Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly greater support in the state legislature are already using similar methods.

AD

Mari-Lynn Poskin, a first-time Democratic candidate for the Kansas House, paid less than $100 this fall to gain between 1,000 and 5,000 views from users interested in politically moderate content in her area south of Kansas City. Her first ad touts Poskin, a lifelong Republican who switched parties after Trump’s 2016 victory, as a “high energy champion for District 20!”

She never could have afforded to get her name out so early on television, she said.

Poskin knows Facebook’s brand has become toxic, having played host to Russian interference in 2016 and now refusing to fact-check political speech. But, she says, it’s a “necessary evil.”

AD

“I have friends who complain about Facebook and say we need to get off, but they’re not getting off,” the 54-year-old said. “So if I want to reach them, I’m going to find them there. I’m going to use it as long as my voters are still getting information and ideas from Facebook.”

AD

Her perspective offers a counterpoint to the growing concern that Facebook ads are primarily a conservative asset. As Twitter found praise for washing its hands of the issue last month, some suggested that Facebook should do the same.

“I think other online platforms would do well to either accept their responsibility for truth or question whether they should be in the business at all,” said Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Ind. Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana and another Democratic presidential candidate, put it bluntly. “Good,” he tweeted. “Your turn, Facebook.”

AD

Yet even as they criticize Facebook, national Democrats rely on the platform to build email lists, solicit small-dollar donations and compete with the conservative media juggernaut that has managed to catapult Trump-friendly stories into a dominant position in Facebook’s News Feed.

AD

Platforms like Facebook have options short of banning political ads entirely, including applying stricter fact-checking rules. Another avenue would be to restrict microtargeting, which Facebook is considering, according to a person familiar with the company’s deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company conversations.

While local Democrats say they understand the case for change, they also lack the resources to navigate a web of new regulations. Poskin’s 27-year-old daughter, for example, moonlights as her social media czar.

AD

These candidates say updates to Facebook’s rules for authenticating pages for political advertising — announced at the end of August — serve as a cautionary tale for those calling on the company to clamp down. Advertisers were required to provide additional information about themselves, as part of the company’s ongoing attempt to fend off foreign influence and give users a better understanding of who is bankrolling political content on the platform.

AD

Experts praised the move as a modest step toward greater transparency. But the extra burden for down-ballot candidates and local causes came into sharp focus in a Facebook group where Kansas Democrats like Poskin trade ideas and seek advice from activists and campaign strategists. When Facebook announced the update, members of the group scrambled to make sense of the rules.

Their efforts offer insight into the real-time, crowdsourced effort to conduct campaigns in a quickly evolving digital landscape.

AD

The simplest methods of complying, which involved having a government website or a Federal Election Commission number available only to federal candidates, were of little use to local candidates in the group. Instead, Poskin had to match her campaign email address to the domain name of her website, provide a nine-digit employer identification number and send Facebook a copy of her driver’s license.

AD

The rules struck some as excessive, especially compared with the ease with which other users seem to slip through the cracks of Facebook’s policies.

“Until we as a whole decide that [Facebook chief executive Mark] Zuckerberg is evil and despicable and get off Facebook, we are stuck with a system where it’s more difficult to run an ad for a school board election than it is to be a white nationalist on their platform,” Kathy Cook, a public education advocate in Shawnee, Kan., wrote in the group.

AD

“Good for democracy, bad for municipal candidates,” Dave Miranda, the director of strategy for a digital firm called Apollo Artistry who helps local candidates running in the Kansas City area, wrote of the new rules in a thread of comments in the private Facebook group.

Michael Franz, a government professor at Bowdoin College and one of Fowler’s co-authors on the working paper, said Trump’s use of the platform is giving Zuckerberg a “reputation as a mastermind of misinformation.”

The finding that Facebook ads benefit down-ballot and first-time candidates serves as a “corrective to what’s emerging as the consensus position,” he said.

Still, Franz won’t defend the company.

“We’d be fine without Facebook,” he said. “I like the advantage it creates for challengers, but we’d be fine.”

For seven months after Michael Bloomberg first passed on running for president in 2020, the former New York City mayor and his tight team of political advisers reviewed the constant flow of polling data they kept commissioning from all over the country and felt mostly okay. The tycoon was at some version of peace about his decision to stay out of the fray — just like he had in 2016 and 2008 — largely because Joe Biden looked well positioned to win the Democratic primary, and then to beat Donald Trump. Bloomberg almost definitely would’ve gotten into the race if the former vice-president wasn’t looking so strong in the spring, his friends said at the time. And for the next six months-plus, they repeated that intel to themselves, to their colleagues, and to anyone who pointed out that Biden, 2020’s moderate standard-bearer, was hardly a strong front-runner. Bloomberg himself was watching closely, of course, trusting in Biden but wondering aloud in private with increasing agitation as the year matured — just like everyone else — about whether anyone in the field was truly ready to beat Trump. But the data, for seven months, held up.

Then Bloomberg’s privately commissioned polls started telling a different story. As news of Trump’s attempted Ukraine extortion spread in September, Bloomberg’s team saw “a shift: Democrats becoming hyper-focused on the issue of electability. It was always a consideration. But becoming hyper-focused,” Howard Wolfson, a top Bloomberg adviser, told New York. “There are obviously plenty of Democrats who are very excited about voting for the most progressive candidate, but what we have seen is there is a large number of Democrats who want to vote for the candidate with the best shot of winning.” Most important, it was no longer obvious to Bloomberg’s team, looking at data showing a weakened Biden — having faced constant attacks and questions about his durability and fitness to match up against Trump — was still that candidate. To Bloomberg, a Bloomberg-shaped opening was finally emerging, just like he’d quietly been musing about for months to associates and political supporters, including a handful of current and former elected officials. “He’s been thinking about this for a long time,” said former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who said he had no advance notice of Bloomberg’s decision. “The thinking is, ‘Does it look like Biden has imploded?’ And obviously it’s looked more and more that way recently,” added a New York power player close with the Bloomberg team.

Biden’s team, of course, doesn’t see it this way, and its immediate concern was that Bloomberg’s entry would freeze the former VP’s already-lagging fundraising. Within hours after the first Thursday Times report of his latest moves, some top Biden aides and allies began calling their current and prospective major donors to reassure them, and to gauge their feelings about Bloomberg’s potential candidacy, according to Democrats familiar with some such conversations. Some big fish either didn’t immediately respond to the calls or told the Biden team to give them some more time — they now had to reconsider given the news.

Bloomberg’s move to start getting his name on primary ballots isn’t a final decision on a full-scale campaign, but it is a new, public stage of an evolving conversation he has been having with supporters and allies for years, especially in the last two. One of the party’s two biggest donors over the last decade, he’s remained wired in: He privately discussed a potential run last year with Democratic honchos including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrats briefed on the talks said, and he’s kept in touch with others like Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, as the presidential race has evolved. Over the spring and into the summer he made no secret to associates about his preference for a centrist candidate like Biden, and his displeasure with Bernie Sanders and the ascendant Elizabeth Warren. (Sometimes this poked into public view: “I just said to Sen. Warren on the way out, ‘Senator, congratulations, it’s a nice talk. But let me just remind you if my company hadn’t been successful, we wouldn’t be here today, so enough with this stuff,’” Bloomberg joked to the audience at a Des Moines gun-safety forum in August.)

Then, in recent weeks, members of his political team, led by strategist Kevin Sheekey, ramped up their outreach to politically powerful New Yorkers over dinners and drinks. The invitees hardly needed reminding that Bloomberg — worth $52 billion, according to Forbes — had talked about spending $1 billion on an independent run in 2016, and could easily drop that much now, too.

The would-be candidate himself is not yet 100 percent convinced that he will run. Early filing deadlines for ballot access in some states forced him to go public with his possible intentions last week. But over the last few days those around Bloomberg have been working to convince political allies and potential supporters that this is for real: “Get ready,” they keep saying. And after the news broke, Bloomberg himself — notoriously not one for glad-handing — made a round of calls that would be expected of a presidential candidate, including to Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez and the chairmen of the state parties in Iowa and New Hampshire, operatives aware of the calls told New York.

Still, even some of his closest ideological and business allies in New York and Washington aren’t sure just how seriously to take it yet, after almost none of them got any heads-up that Bloomberg was seriously reconsidering the race. Many have requested calls or briefings from Bloomberg or his lieutenants, hoping to understand exactly where they see room for him in the race when polling shows the electorate is not actually dissatisfied with the primary field — just 4 percent said they were undecided because of a lack of good choices in a USC/Los Angeles Times survey last week. Bloomberg would also enter the race with national support between that of Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang and with the highest unfavorability rating of any Democrat — at least before unleashing his inevitable torrent of money for ads.

“This is ridiculous,” one New York Democrat in regular, friendly contact with Team Bloomberg told me. “I love those guys,” he said. But “you will not be able to find an individual who is not on their payroll who’ll say this is a good idea.”

THE PROSPECT THAT’S making many of the skeptics from the center-left particularly nervous is Bloomberg’s entry weakening support for Biden and Pete Buttigieg, arguably the two leading moderates in the race, while also himself not winning. That could clear Warren or Sanders’s path to the nomination, while giving them reason to go extra-heavy on billionaire bashing. Already both of them have made political hay of yet another tycoon’s interest in the race, as have others like Yang, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker.

But Bloomberg looks like he’s trying to find a way around that outcome, employing a new game plan altogether. The idea is to skip the first four states in the nominating process, where every other candidate has already spent months and millions of dollars, and to instead build up operations in the states that vote in March, when the field will presumably be less crowded. The plan was almost immediately compared to Rudy Giuliani’s ill-fated attempt to do something similar in 2008 by not seriously contesting any states until Florida, though in reality Giuliani did briefly try to compete in the preceding states, but failed. Bloomberg, too, spent time in Iowa and New Hampshire when he was first considering a run earlier this year. In any case, it’s too late for him to try organizing them now.

The revelation of this strategy has infuriated the traditional gatekeepers in the states that usually play the biggest roles in the process. The idea came into public view in a series of reports on Friday, thanks to Wolfson, who along with Sheekey, ad maker Bill Knapp, and pollster Doug Schoen have long made up Bloomberg’s inner circle, though the mayor has also brought on Brynne Craig, a veteran of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, and worked with top Barack Obama campaign alums Mitch Stewart and Dan Wagner. Both Iowa and New Hampshire’s Democratic Party chairs almost immediately made a point of their “disappointment” (read: fury) that a candidate would skip their contests, which are central to the nominating path but constantly under threat from reformers who want to change it. The latter’s Raymond Buckley warned, “It’s unfortunate that Michael Bloomberg doesn’t want to participate in this invaluable, important, and unique primary process and be tested in the same way that the other Democratic candidates have been and will be.” But it also sparked speculation that he’s positioning himself as a white-knight candidate who could step in if Biden collapses in the first four states. It’s a plan of attack that fits perfectly with Bloomberg’s likeliest preferred campaign tactic: blanketing states with television ads and paid organizers, rather than personally stopping through diners to greet voters day after day, and trying to lead rousing rallies. “They’re looking for a coronation,” griped a senior Democratic strategist who’s worked closely with the Bloomberg operation for years. “Is he really willing to do the retail thing? Billions in ads don’t get you where you need to be. Just look at Tom Steyer.”

The entry of a well-funded, well-known candidate swooping in just as huge states begin voting could also raise the probability of a contested convention come July, warned one longtime Bloomberg associate currently being courted by both the former mayor and the former vice-president. Others who’d voiced a similar concern about Steyer — the hedge-fund billionaire and environmental and impeachment activist and the only person to spend more on Democratic politics than Bloomberg in the last decade — worried it could draw Bloomberg’s attention from his funding of liberal operations around the country, particularly around voter data and climate and gun-control issues. He’s talked about spending half a billion dollars on that work this election cycle. (“The Democrats owe him a tremendous amount of credit,” said McAuliffe, whom Bloomberg supported in his 2013 gubernatorial run, and who at one point discussed a campaign role with Biden. “I have nothing but great things to say about him.”) Bloomberg has not indicated that he would put these projects aside, and those close to him find that unlikely. But some leading party operatives who acknowledge how reliant they are on his cash and network are still nervous about the left’s funding and organizing future if he were to focus more on the campaign.

Even some of the Democrats closest to Bloomberg aren’t sure this is anything more than a trial balloon to see how voters and the media treat him before fully committing. Or, in the words of one of his longtime backers who is now on Team Biden, “an insurance policy” that might never be tapped. For one thing, it’s far from clear that Bloomberg — a former Republican and Independent — would be able to make many Biden supporters think twice. The ex-VP’s base, after all, is not suburban moderates so much as non-college-educated white voters and African-Americans in states like South Carolina. “This could be famous last words, but this may be like Wesley Clark entering, getting single digits, then not getting anywhere,” said one powerful state Democratic Party chair who hasn’t heard from Bloomberg, repeating a popular comparison to the general who entered the 2004 race in September of 2003, then flopped. Then there are Bloomberg’s repeated flirtations with running since 2006. “Until I hear Mike say, on the record, ‘I’m in,’ I won’t believe it,” another top New York City political operator close to Bloomberg’s team told me.

Even if Bloomberg ultimately decides against a run, he’s already changed the dynamics of the race for some major candidates and moneymen. For one, his tentative entry sucked up all the oxygen in the 2020 media room for the weekend, lightening the scrutiny Warren had been receiving for her Medicare for All funding plan and allowing her to regain an offensive posture by coming out swinging against his candidacy. Meanwhile, “you’re going to have billionaires out there crying tears of joy for their savior,” said a well-connected East Coast fundraiser who’s spoken extensively with Bloomberg and his deputies in recent months. “The Bloomberg people are going to have to convince them to calm down.” A few minutes after we hung up, investor Leon Cooperman — who’s recently been attacking Warren like he did Obama in 2011 — said he’d back Bloomberg, and the next day Recode reported that Jeff Bezos had asked him to run earlier this year.

But that plutocratic brand of exuberance has its limits. Some of Bloomberg’s friends said they’re concerned that if the mayor pumps the brakes, this renewed flirtation with 2020 runs the risk of already having backfired. It hasn’t just given the populist left’s preferred candidates an easy applause line, a handful worried over the weekend, it may have cast yet another shadow over a Biden campaign that could use as much sunlight as possible these days.

“I don’t see how this doesn’t hand the nomination to Warren,” sighed a Manhattan financier, a longtime Bloomberg supporter who’d tried nudging him toward running late last year and early in 2019. This spring, after Bloomberg initially said he wouldn’t run, the financier considered a range of other candidates before settling on backing Biden. He continued, “I don’t see how this isn’t the most destructive thing he could possibly do.”"

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent is slightly closer to Warren than she is to Biden. Bloomberg sits in sixth place with 4 percent.

This is not to say that Bloomberg couldn’t catch on, especially if Biden falls short in early states. However, it does throw cold water on the notion he could breeze into the race in March having skipped the four early states and expect to be competitive. If he is not competitive now, imagine where he will be in four months after one or more contenders have won contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

If Biden does falter early on, there is every reason to believe one of the candidates already in the race will move in to scoop up Biden voters before Bloomberg finds his footing. Buttigieg is annoying his rivals, peeved that he is connecting with voters, especially in Iowa where his polling and crowd size continue rising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is into the December debate and now is pushing back against Buttigieg on grounds of experience:

“Of the women on the stage… do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that [Mayor Pete Buttigieg] had? No, I don’t. Maybe we’re held to a different standard.” - Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Mayor Buttigieg’s qualifications #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/xz0cEH86OZ — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 10, 2019

A race between two non-elderly and super-articulate moderates, I would suggest, would be the interesting battle for Biden votes, especially in the primaries in the Midwest and South where New York’s ex-mayor does not equate with “electable” in the minds of many Democratic voters. A young mayor and Afghanistan War veteran vs. a more experienced female senator would be an engaging contest, the party well-served by the competition and well-represented should either of them prevail.

Klobuchar likely struck a cord with regular Democratic voters when she declared, “I don’t think you just waltz in and say, instead of ‘I’m good enough to be president,’ your argument is the other people aren’t good enough — that is not how we’ve been conducting these debates.” She added, “When people look at the White House and see this multimillionaire — including, by the way, independents and moderate Republicans — and now he’s messing up so many things, I don’t think they say, ‘Oh, we need someone richer.' I think you have to earn votes and not buy them.” Touché.

In short, the notion that the Democratic Party needs another old, white rich guy to save itself from the clutches of Warren is a bit preposterous. For starters, Warren is doing a fine job slowing her own momentum by tossing out a rainbows-and-unicorns Medicare-for-all plan (and then refusing to defend it on the merits from a torrent of criticism). Meanwhile, moderates are still sticking with Biden and have not one but two fine alternatives should he crumble. Maybe the media have been pining to write Bloomberg stories, but so far there is little indication that Democratic primary voters are pining for his candidacy. Indeed, the odds that Bloomberg will never enter the race at all seem better than the odds he will do much to affect it.

With Simmons’s help, Sanders (I-Vt.) — along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — is working frantically to narrow Biden’s commanding lead among South Carolina’s African Americans, who make up just under two-thirds of the state’s Democratic voters.

Rather than attack Biden directly, his rivals are mostly deploying tactics that include church visits and tailgate parties, and holding private conversations and teaming up with young influencers who can spread the word. The Feb. 29 South Carolina primary will be a pivotal sign of minority support three days before Super Tuesday, which itself features 15 states, including California and Texas.

Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg have each faced obstacles attracting support from black voters, a challenge that has been apparent as each has drawn increasingly large and excited, albeit mostly white, crowds to campaign events. Biden has held a wide lead in South Carolina since he entered the race, the beneficiary of wide name recognition, decades of trips to South Carolina and, as Simmons points out, a stamp of approval earned serving in the White House under Barack Obama.

“He does have long-standing, deep and abiding relationships in South Carolina — they’re real,” Columbia Mayor Stephen K. Benjamin said. “There’s some catch-up that everyone else is doing.”

In the interest of catching up, Biden’s rivals are trying to play to whatever strengths they have. Warren is making appeals to black women. Buttigieg and Sanders are aiming at younger activists, largely ceding the older generation to Biden.

The goal for Biden’s rivals, at least for now, is not to overtake him among black voters but to come out of the South Carolina primary with at least a respectable showing, Democratic strategists say — and to be well positioned in case Biden stumbles in Iowa or New Hampshire, which hold votes shortly before South Carolina.

AD

To date, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg have all held events in predominantly black areas of South Carolina — only to have the voters who show up be overwhelmingly white. Biden, in contrast, touts his solid support from African Americans as evidence of his political strength.

“I’m the only person in this race that has support from every constituency that we have,” including young people, Biden told reporters recently. “I have more from African Americans. I have more support from them than anyone. The Democratic Party is a big tent, and in order to win you have to reach out and win parts of all the constituencies.”

The latest Monmouth Poll in South Carolina gave Biden 39 percent support among African American Democratic primary voters, compared with 11 percent for Warren and Sanders and 8 percent for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is black. Buttigieg is at 1 percent among black voters.

Warren’s counteroffensive includes 40-plus organizers and 10 field offices across the state, including small places like rural Orangeburg, a city of about 13,000 where 75 percent of the residents are black. Away from journalists and rallies, she is holding private sit-downs with influential undecided black women.

Hours before taking the stage at a recent forum at historically black Benedict College, Warren sat down at her hotel for an ask-anything Q&A with a small group of elected black women and other influencers.

“Those women represent hundreds and hundreds of voters in their circles,” said state Rep. Wendy C. Brawley, a Warren supporter who is helping the candidate make such connections.

AD

Warren did not explicitly ask for an endorsement as the attendees munched on muffins and fruit. Rather, she encouraged the women to keep an open mind about her candidacy, answered questions and listened to criticism.

AD

“It was very open — ask anything you want,” said Columbia City Council member Tameika Isaac Devine. “Someone asked why she hadn’t been to South Carolina more. And somebody asked did she feel like she was too liberal to bring the country together.”

It is not clear that Warren’s answers persuaded anyone, but the campaign hopes such events plant seeds. A few hours later, Warren stopped by the historic Bethel AME Church in Columbia for a private meeting with another small group of black voters.

AD

Buttigieg, the youngest candidate at 37, is focusing much of his South Carolina outreach on historically black colleges and universities. He recently hosted a tailgate party at Allen University's homecoming football game.

A DJ hired by the campaign eschewed Buttigieg’s usual rally song — “High Hopes” by the alternative rock band Panic! At the Disco — in favor of rap and hip-hop. “We ain’t playing no ‘High Hopes’ here,” one organizer quipped.

AD

The event was organized in part by Walter A. Clyburn Reed, grandson of Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a powerful figure in South Carolina politics. The elder Clyburn has not endorsed a presidential candidate, though he is a longtime friend of Biden’s and has worked with Warren in Congress.

AD

“As you know, 2020 is coming up,” Reed exhorted the small crowd at the Oct. 26 tailgate. “If you didn’t vote in 2016, I understand. If you didn’t vote in 2018, I understand. But in 2020, it’s not a game.”

Reed regularly notes his grandfather’s support for his political activity on social media, sometimes using the hashtag #BlackAndProud4Pete.

Buttigieg likes to cite what he calls the Douglass Plan, an elaborate racial justice proposal he rolled out in July. It would direct a quarter of government contracts to minority businesses and cut the federal and state incarceration rate, among other steps.

AD

Buttigieg persuaded hundreds of prominent black South Carolinians to sign onto the plan even if they are not supporting his candidacy. His campaign then trumpeted these signatures in a way that forced figures such as Devine, for one, to clarify that she was not endorsing Buttigieg.

AD

But as Buttigieg tries to build relationships with black voters, his problems outside South Carolina echo within it. In June, a white police officer in South Bend, where Buttigieg is mayor, shot a black man, setting off weeks of protests.

More recently, Buttigieg distanced himself from a supporter named Steve Patton, a former Chicago city attorney who tried to block the release of a video showing the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, angering many black leaders.

Patton was set to co-host a fundraiser for Buttigieg last month. He was ultimately removed from that role, but Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said the matter should have set off Buttigieg’s “natural radar” much earlier.

“Every time he seems to go three steps forward, something happens . . . and it takes him six steps backwards,” Seawright said of Buttigieg’s outreach to black voters. The campaign, he said, must get “a better handle on the things they can control if they want a better shot of making inroads within the African American community.”

Sanders’s African American backers say his message of revolutionary change has particular relevance for the black community. Sanders surrogates recently took a “Medicare for Y’all” tour through the state, in part to expound on how the candidate’s Medicare-for-all plan would help African Americans.

One Sanders supporter, South Carolina State Rep. Ivory Thigpen, has been touting the Vermont senator to members of his church. In a flier that has been mailed around Columbia, Thigpen says Sanders’s agenda is “driven by compassion: compassion in health care, in the criminal justice system, and economic justice.”

AD

In an interview, Thigpen said Democrats must nominate a candidate who can electrify black voters and others. He suggested that’s not Biden.

“Have you ever been to a Trump rally? You should see the energy,” Thigpen said. “They’re turning over tables, they’re pushing around stuff. It’s a heightened level of excitement. Will the Democratic Party with its nominee be able to match that type of energy?”

Two black candidates in the race, Harris and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), have so far failed to show they can generate such energy. (Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick launched his campaign last week.) Harris initially put much of her focus on South Carolina, but after meager results, she has shifted her emphasis to Iowa. Booker has made a significant investment in the Palmetto State, visiting often and hiring respected operatives but has yet to catch on there.

AD

Sanders hopes to do better. The youthful state legislators supporting him hold themselves up as a breakthrough generation, and they say the Vermont senator amounts to the same thing on a national level.

Simmons said her conversations with Biden supporters do not end after she tries to divorce his accomplishments from Obama’s. She goes on to tell them that Sanders may be an unconventional politician, but that is a good thing.

She is a single mother of five and one of the youngest members of the legislature. She is an African American representative in a state that just four years ago flew a Confederate battle flag on state capitol grounds.

“I bring a whole new perspective to the statehouse,” Simmons said. “I am younger. I have the most kids of anybody in the legislature. I’m still working a full-time job by myself, which not a lot of [legislators] do.”

Regarding Sanders, she asked, “What if you can bring fresh eyes to the situation?”"

But it’s hard to see his winning a lot of Democratic primaries, and not just because he turned himself into a temporary Republican to get to City Hall. From the moment word went out that he was pondering a campaign for president, he sharpened the class and ideological divisions within the Democratic electorate.

Somewhere on the seventh tee, the phony populist Trump is laughing. One side of the Democratic Party is denouncing its foes as class enemies and apologists of the rich. The other argues that champions of the left will destroy the American economy. Is this how Democrats want to spend the next few months?

Bloomberg might usefully notice that the two candidates most elated by the prospect of his candidacy are Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). A multi-multi-billionaire is the foil Warren and Sanders dream about.

Warren’s supporters are understandably angry over how the party’s Wall Street wing has recently sharpened its knives against her, especially on her wealth tax.

In fact, the wealth tax underscores how much money is concentrated at the very top of our economy. Warren is asking why the wealth of so many middle-class Americans is already taxed (homes are their biggest nest egg, and they pay real estate taxes every year), while the holdings of the very rich often never face a levy. Perhaps her wealth tax will need to be reconfigured in the form of higher taxes on the capital gains, estates and transactions of the most fortunate Americans. Nonetheless, she has already transformed our thinking about how the government should raise money.

Medicare-for-all is similarly helpful, putting fundamental change on the agenda and making clear how moderate Obamacare is by comparison. But as my Post colleagues Ruth Marcus and Catherine Rampell pointed out last week, Warren’s heroic efforts to explain how it would work highlighted its vulnerability to both substantive and political attacks.

Democrats have the high ground on health care now. In Kentucky’s race for governor, Democrat Andy Beshear demonstrated that even Trump voters want to save and build on the Affordable Care Act. Why throw away this advantage? All Democrats should support universal coverage, but we can get there, as other countries have, through mixed public-private systems. Arguments over Medicare-for-all would make sense after we finish the initial work of covering everyone.

When it comes to former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Bloomberg’s actions can be seen as a vote of no confidence. It’s true that Biden, shall we say, hasn’t lived up to the hopes of his supporters. Buttigieg has yet to solve his problems with the African American community.

But Bloomberg’s support for stop-and-frisk policing will hardly make him more popular than Buttigieg among black voters. And polls suggest that in South Carolina and Nevada — the states that vote after Iowa and New Hampshire, where Biden is in trouble — the former vice president is hanging on. In the meantime, Buttigieg is surging in Iowa. Bloomberg could thus be a spoiler for the candidates he is closest to ideologically — without winning himself.

But here’s the larger issue: Democrats need a leader who can remind progressives and moderates that they have far more in common than their current strife would suggest. These competing camps agree on the urgency of ousting Trump, but also on getting health insurance to everyone, moving forcefully on climate change, acting humanely on immigration, defending civil and voting rights, and pushing back against growing inequality.

The person who rises to the task of pulling these sides together will deserve the nomination. Will one of these candidates even audition for the part?

“Online advertising lowers the cost and the barriers to entry,” Fowler said, in part because advertisers can pay for specific impressions rather than having to display ads to an entire local television audience, which may exceed a particular electoral district, creating unnecessary costs.

That targeting ability was critical to Democrat Rui Xu, who won election to the Kansas House of Representatives last year. He attributes his victory in part to his advertising campaign on Facebook.

“I really, really honed my messaging on Facebook,” said Xu, 30, who used the platform’s microtargeting tools, in combination with a list of voters in the district, to reach specific users. He spent an estimated $2,500 on the platform — and nothing on television.

“I have friends who complain about Facebook and say we need to get off, but they’re not getting off,” the 54-year-old said. “So if I want to reach them, I’m going to find them there. I’m going to use it as long as my voters are still getting information and ideas from Facebook.”

AD

Her perspective offers a counterpoint to the growing concern that Facebook ads are primarily a conservative asset. As Twitter found praise for washing its hands of the issue last month, some suggested that Facebook should do the same.

“I think other online platforms would do well to either accept their responsibility for truth or question whether they should be in the business at all,” said Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Ind. Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana and another Democratic presidential candidate, put it bluntly. “Good,” he tweeted. “Your turn, Facebook.”

AD

Yet even as they criticize Facebook, national Democrats rely on the platform to build email lists, solicit small-dollar donations and compete with the conservative media juggernaut that has managed to catapult Trump-friendly stories into a dominant position in Facebook’s News Feed.

AD

Platforms like Facebook have options short of banning political ads entirely, including applying stricter fact-checking rules. Another avenue would be to restrict microtargeting, which Facebook is considering, according to a person familiar with the company’s deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company conversations.

While local Democrats say they understand the case for change, they also lack the resources to navigate a web of new regulations. Poskin’s 27-year-old daughter, for example, moonlights as her social media czar.

AD

These candidates say updates to Facebook’s rules for authenticating pages for political advertising — announced at the end of August — serve as a cautionary tale for those calling on the company to clamp down. Advertisers were required to provide additional information about themselves, as part of the company’s ongoing attempt to fend off foreign influence and give users a better understanding of who is bankrolling political content on the platform.

AD

Experts praised the move as a modest step toward greater transparency. But the extra burden for down-ballot candidates and local causes came into sharp focus in a Facebook group where Kansas Democrats like Poskin trade ideas and seek advice from activists and campaign strategists. When Facebook announced the update, members of the group scrambled to make sense of the rules.

Their efforts offer insight into the real-time, crowdsourced effort to conduct campaigns in a quickly evolving digital landscape.

AD

The simplest methods of complying, which involved having a government website or a Federal Election Commission number available only to federal candidates, were of little use to local candidates in the group. Instead, Poskin had to match her campaign email address to the domain name of her website, provide a nine-digit employer identification number and send Facebook a copy of her driver’s license.

AD

The rules struck some as excessive, especially compared with the ease with which other users seem to slip through the cracks of Facebook’s policies.

“Until we as a whole decide that [Facebook chief executive Mark] Zuckerberg is evil and despicable and get off Facebook, we are stuck with a system where it’s more difficult to run an ad for a school board election than it is to be a white nationalist on their platform,” Kathy Cook, a public education advocate in Shawnee, Kan., wrote in the group.

AD

“Good for democracy, bad for municipal candidates,” Dave Miranda, the director of strategy for a digital firm called Apollo Artistry who helps local candidates running in the Kansas City area, wrote of the new rules in a thread of comments in the private Facebook group.

Michael Franz, a government professor at Bowdoin College and one of Fowler’s co-authors on the working paper, said Trump’s use of the platform is giving Zuckerberg a “reputation as a mastermind of misinformation.”

The finding that Facebook ads benefit down-ballot and first-time candidates serves as a “corrective to what’s emerging as the consensus position,” he said.

Still, Franz won’t defend the company.

“We’d be fine without Facebook,” he said. “I like the advantage it creates for challengers, but we’d be fine.”

You can understand why Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar is annoyed by the relative success on the presidential campaign trail of South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. She’s easily won three Senate races in a state that’s been trending Republican. Buttigieg has twice been elected mayor of the 306th largest city in America. She’s the next-door senator to Iowa Democrats. Pete’s town is more than 400 miles from Des Moines. Klobuchar’s claim to represent the Democratic mainstream against the dangerous lefty-progressives threatening to take over the party is based on an extensive Senate voting record. Buttigieg’s “fighting centrist” credentials are mostly a matter of assertion, and didn’t really emerge even in this campaign for a good while.

Yet Buttigieg leads Klobuchar in the RealClearPolitics polling averages for Iowa by 17.5 percent to 4.0 percent; for New Hampshire by 11.3 percent to 3.3 percent; and nationally by 7.0 percent to 2.6 percent. He’s raised a lot more money than Klobuchar: over $50 million so far in 2017, compared to her $18.8 million. Her explanation for this disparity seems pretty simple, and got some attention when she repeated it on CNN’s Sunday show this last weekend (as reported by the Washington Post):

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Sunday that women in politics are held to a higher standard than men, arguing that a female candidate with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s experience probably would not make it to the presidential debate stage.

Klobuchar’s comments mark the latest instance of a 2020 presidential contender taking aim at Buttigieg, a newcomer on the national political stage whose ascent in the fundraising race and in polls for the Democratic nomination has taken many by surprise.

They also bring renewed attention to the hurdles female candidates face, following former vice president Joe Biden’s description last week of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as “angry” and antagonistic.

As it happens, both Buttigieg and Klobuchar have already qualified for the November and December debates. So I guess in theory she’s not talking about herself but instead of some hypothetical woman. But Klobuchar also clearly wants to convey that she is being held to a double standard, too:

Klobuchar, who is on her third term in the Senate, described herself as “the one from the Midwest that’s actually won in a statewide race over and over again,” adding, “That’s not true of Mayor Pete.”

So the not-so-veiled suggestion is that Buttigieg’s success is principally the product of male (or perhaps white male) privilege.

Buttigieg has answered this charge earlier in the campaign, acknowledging his privileges but observing that it’s not the whole story of his candidacy, as Laura Bradley observed back in April:

[W]hen host Trevor Noah asked “Mayor Pete” whether he believes he’s benefited from white privilege, Buttigieg responded by acknowledging both that those privileges exist and that he’s considered that very question.

“I’d like to believe it’s my qualities and my message,” Buttigieg told Noah. “But I’ve been reflecting on this because one of the things about privilege, especially things like white privilege or male privilege, is that you don’t think about it very much. It’s being in an out-group where you are constantly reminded of it. It’s not when you are in a majority or a privileged group. And so, I try to check myself and make sure I try to understand the factors that help explain why things are going well.”

Pete probably didn’t have to say it out loud, but his other defense is that he, too, is a member of an “out-group” thanks to his gay sexual identity. So he’s not just some random vaguely centrist white male dude like Steve Bullock or Michael Bennet, whom Buttigieg is also trouncing in the polls, not to mention Beto O’Rourke, John Hickenlooper, Seth Moulton, or Tim Ryan, who have already dropped out. Each and every one of them had a better résumé than Pete, but that didn’t matter. And as a New York Times piece this week suggested, lots of candidates both resent and envy Buttigieg:

“It is a natural thing when a young candidate comes along and has success for other candidates who feel like they’ve toiled in the vineyards to resent it,” said David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama in 2008. “I think they’d like him better if he weren’t doing as well …”

Campaign aides acknowledge privately that Mr. Buttigieg triggers some of his rivals. But they dismiss the criticism as little more than sour grapes. Over last weekend in Iowa, he drew crowds of several hundred people in towns that numbered just a few thousand.

And it’s blind quotes like that which make other camps resent Mayor Pete even more.

Some observers assume Buttigieg’s sexual orientation is a handicap. But Gallup data show how rapidly that is ceasing to be an issue: Currently 83 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of independents (and even 61 percent of Republicans) deem themselves willing to vote for a gay or lesbian president, and the trend lines are clearly and quickly moving toward more acceptance of LGBTQ pols, and people generally. Meanwhile, being openly gay has pretty clearly helped Buttigieg raise money, as the New York Times reported in April:

After vaulting into the top tier of presidential candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination — going from “adorable” to “plausible,” in his own words — Mr. Buttigieg is building on the fly a nationwide network of donors that is anchored by many wealthy and well-connected figures in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political circles.

From more intimate cocktail parties on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where the composer Stephen Sondheim appeared in March, to larger events, like a planned June gala at the Beverly Hills home of the television producer Ryan Murphy, the L.G.B.T. donor base is helping push Mr. Buttigieg from the margins of the presidential contest into the same moneyed circles that raised millions of dollars for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Top L.G.B.T. donors face no shortage of loyal allies among the 20 Democratic candidates. But Mr. Buttigieg’s candidacy has struck an especially powerful chord with many of them. Though many said they believed they would see a gay man or lesbian become a serious contender for the White House one day, most of them had never considered it beyond the abstract. Mr. Buttigieg’s ascent has made a sudden and unexpected reality of something they thought was still years away, if not decades.

So Buttigieg’s sexual orientation is an “identity politics” credential for him that matters not just to LGBTQ folks, but to those who care about equality and breaking “glass ceilings.” Buttigieg would probably be the first to acknowledge that his claim to pioneer status is not as powerful as that of Barack Obama’s in 2008 (which the at time was resented by some feminists backing Hillary Clinton) or HRC’s in 2016. But it’s real, and the fact that he is married, religiously observant, and a military veteran adds a traditionalist twist to his background and identity which some voters likely find appealing — along with his much-discussed verbal skills. His youth, in an age-heavy field and in a party unusually dependent on millennial and post-millennial votes, is also an asset. And it’s worth noting that he didn’t exactly come out of nowhere: His well-regarded if unsuccessful 2017 race for DNC chair earned him a lot of good will, as Business Insider reported at the time:

John Verdejo had never heard of Pete Buttigieg before the Democratic National Committee chair’s race. By Saturday’s vote, he had only one impression of the South Bend, Indiana, mayor.

“Mind. Blown. Mind. Blown. You ask any of the DNC members here, and he was their second choice. I don’t care if you voted for Perez first, Ellison first — Buttigieg was their No. 2,” the North Carolina DNC member said here at the committee’s winter meeting in Atlanta.

None of this is to say that Buttigieg’s current position is stable, or fully earned. His “whiteness” is indeed an issue in the nominating contest, thanks to the trouble he has had dealing with police-minority relations in South Bend, and that may doom his candidacy when the contest moves past the very white states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

But the idea that Pete Buttigieg’s gender is the only reason anyone would prefer him to Amy Klobuchar a bit of a reach.

Now if Klobuchar was really arguing that a woman exactly like Pete Buttigieg — a married, lesbian, small-city mayor with military service who attends church and is unusually articulate about a more-or-less-centrist policy agenda – wouldn’t be doing as well as he is, thanks to media or voting bias or whatever — well, that’s a different proposition. But it’s not one we will get to test in 2020."

Photo: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images

First it was Michael Bloomberg. Now it’s former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick considering throwing his hat into the once-shrinking, now possibly expanding, ring of Democratic candidates. (Oh, and possibly Hillary Clinton for good measure.) But could Patrick actually make a difference in the race? I spoke with national correspondent Gabriel Debenedetti and political columnist Ed Kilgore to try to figure it out.

Ben: Deval Patrick seemed like a possibly promising presidential candidate about a year ago. Then he became among the first high-profile names to declare he wouldn’t run, citing, reasonably enough, the “cruelty of our elections process.” Now, in a twist I don’t really think anyone saw coming, he might jump in at the last minute after all. Could he shake up the race, or this mostly just wishful thinking on his end?

Gabriel: Depends what you mean by “shake up,” but it’s hard to see how he could come in this late and win if he’s really trying to compete in New Hampshire (which, notably, Mike Bloomberg is saying he wouldn’t do). All indications are the former Massachusetts governor wants to play in the early state, but it’s been organized and advertised in by the other candidates for a year.

Ed: He’s got until Friday (the NH filing deadline) to lie down and get over it.

Sorry to usurp Ben’s role, but I do have a question for Gabe: How much of this do you think just reflects the famous “donor panic” we’ve been hearing so much about?

Ben: I was getting to that…

Gabriel: I don’t know about donors who have been encouraging Patrick, specifically. But there’s definitely a feeling of “AAHH! We need someone else!” in much of the professional political class that’s simply not reflected in the primary electorate. As I pointed out in my story about Bloomberg yesterday, a recent USC/LAT poll showed only 4 percent of Democratic primary voters are undecided because they’re unsatisfied with the candidates. All that said, it’s definitely true that a lot of donors (and strategists and former pols and people that just generally like to think of themselves as savvy) are very, very worried about the field and, most importantly, the front-running candidates’ ability to beat Trump. No doubt Patrick feels the same way and has participated in such conversations, or we wouldn’t be here. I mean, every day I get texts from political pros, donors, and retired electeds wondering “who else might be out there?”

Ed: Well, Patrick does work at Bain Capital.

Gabriel: To back up for a second, the idea of a Patrick candidacy was not far-fetched at all around a year ago.

Ed: A big part of his promise, though, was the implied support of a certain former president and his circle.

Gabriel: You mean Carter?

Ed: Haha. I was going to say Bill Clinton.

Gabriel: Kidding. Last year, there were very influential corners of ObamaWorld (insofar as “ObamaWorld” is still a real thing) that took Patrick 2020 much more seriously than the potential candidacies of the other two Obama friends who were looking at it, Joe Biden and Eric Holder. So that wasn’t a crazy premise. (Michael Bennet is also an Obama friend, but, well. Yeah.)

It’s true he’s been working at Bain Capital, which would obviously be hard to maneuver politically, but the idea of a moderate former governor who is close with Obama, who could theoretically be very competitive in New Hampshire and South Carolina, was a promising one.

Ed: Julián Castro was in his Cabinet.

Gabriel: Indeed, but never a personal friend.

Ben: As many have noted, not only are Democrats satisfied with their choices, according to the polls, but the great moderate hope, Joe Biden, is doing perfectly fine in national and most state polls — just not so much Iowa and New Hampshire. Does the apparent concern about his candidacy have more to do with his ability to win the primary and/or general, or a certain level of alarm about his slips of the tongue and faculties in general? It’s not like the latter concern hasn’t been around for quite a while now.

Gabriel: Well, the concern is that the latter is feeding into the former.

Ed: Is there any intel suggesting that these fears about Uncle Joe extend deeply into the circles of the 44th president? Because any hint of Obama giving up on Biden could really set off the kindling beneath his campaign.

Ben: Ed, I’ll ask the questions here.

Gabriel: None of this would be happening, of course, if Biden were in a stronger position. But the overarching fear that’s causing it is that he would lose to Trump. Secondarily, it’s that he can’t even get out of the primary and someone even less acceptable to the general population would win it.

No, Obama has been extremely careful not to send any signals.

Ben: Do you find there to be a mismatch between the donor sentiment and what you see on the ground, though, in terms of Biden’s actual capabilities to make it through the primary?

Gabriel: Of course. There’s a mismatch in donor sentiment and voter sentiment on, like, everything right now. It’s just a mismatch, though, not a total disagreement. There’s a reason Pete Buttigieg is having a moment right now — a lot of people who might otherwise be interested in Biden are giving him a look. A lot of donors, too. The idea that Biden is vulnerable isn’t exactly a niche one born of Wall Street.

Ed: Trouble is, of course, that Biden has blocked the emergence of what donors probably want — another Bill Clinton or Barack Obama: a centrist with charisma and an interesting story.

Ben: And that’s where Mayor Pete comes in.

Ed: Yeah, but you can see why he would not be the answer to every donor’s prayer. His inability to appeal to African-Americans (which Patrick presumably could do) and his brief résumé (Patrick’s is fine) are problems, even if his sexual orientation isn’t considered a handicap.You could almost see Patrick’s name emerge from a discussion of why Buttigieg isn’t the answer.

Ben: We should note, though, that the current black candidates in the race aren’t exactly doing great numbers among black voters. Joe Biden continues to dominate there.

Gabriel: A lot of this gets to what I noted above: Patrick had a lot of promise when he was first considering the race. The thing I’m unsure of now is what dynamics would change with him in it, other than the novelty generating news coverage, and therefore some attention that might be good for him.

Ben: Back then, I recall chatting about whether he would actually be appealing to voters. Bain Capital was seen as a possible albatross.

Ed: Yeah, I’m not saying I think Patrick makes sense; just trying to make sense of why he’s getting this very late boomlet of interest.

Gabriel: I’m not convinced there is a boomlet of interest at all. Just a boomlet of “My name is Deval Patrick, and I might be interested.”

Ben: Are there other big names we should be expecting to jump in over the next few weeks? Andrew Cuomo? Al Gore? Walter Mondale?

Ed: No.

Gabriel: Maybe Cory Booker should leak to the Times that he’s considering filing for the New Hampshire primary, and he’ll get a front-page story too. (No.)

Ed: Haha. But seriously, it’s the filing deadlines that are creating this little squall. When a few more pass, it will probably end.

Gabriel: Yes, exactly. And that’s actually one of the things that makes this all slightly baffling, as I said up top. If Patrick thinks he can seriously compete for NH, that would be a massive development, and I would be fascinated to see the data he’s looking at.

Ben: Is there nothing that would point to that being a possibility? He was a popular governor in my home state of Massachusetts, across the border. He’s a skilled politician and, like his friend Obama, an excellent orator — among the best in this field, for sure.

Ed: Last Massachusetts pol to come in late and sweep the New Hampshire primary was Henry Cabot Lodge in 1964 … and he was in Saigon.

Ben: Good history lesson.

Gabriel: As far as I can tell, there were zero NH polls this cycle before Patrick took himself out of the running. There’s no obvious evidence that he’d do well there. Of course, he’s from next door. But so are two other candidates who’ve been near-constant presences in NH for a year, or, in one case, five years.

Ben: So is this really just a lesson about how big your average politican’s ego really is?

Gabriel: I don’t know if this is all about ego. He was a successful governor! But it is a lesson about how nervous professional Democrats are.

Ed: For reasons we’ve talked about off and on all cycle, this is a year in which an awful lot of pols are going to see the next president of the United States in the mirror: the Trump ’16 example, the sense that this is the highest-stakes election of our era, and now the very size of the field which makes the emergence of a real front-runner so difficult."

Times appended a correction to the story, but the write-ups, hot takes and notions of Buttigieg as an Obama critic had already gone into the world. Interestingly — and worryingly — to some journalism and communications experts, the correction did not necessarily sway everyone who had reacted to a now-debunked premise.

AD

“It does reinforce the velocity of social media and Twitter and taking comments — true or not, in context or not — and magnifying them exponentially,” Bill Grueskin, who teaches about trends in journalism and digital media at Columbia Journalism School, told The Washington Post. “It shows what happens when you go too fast. The results can be catastrophic.”

The virality of the Buttigieg misquote comes amid the ramp-up to a high-stakes election cycle that is increasingly driven by social media; it also indicates how the intensifying speed and reach of inaccurate information threatens to further erode public trust in the news at the same time audiences retreat further into ideological bubbles.

To illustrate the reach of just one tentacle of the misinformation, Clemson University communications professor Darren Linvill used a data tool to scrape Twitter for every mention of the specific misquoted phrase — “failures of the Obama era” — from when the L.A. Times article went live Sunday afternoon to 5 p.m. Eastern on Monday. The results showed nearly 20,000 tweets discussing the quote that were a mix of reactions to the misquote and the later correction. Linvill notes the 20,000 tweets are not representative of the entirety of the discussion about the Buttigieg story on Twitter and only capture a slice of the conversation, based on the search term (it also does not include tweets that were deleted before the search query).

AD

AD

Linvill, who spent the past year and a half studying how Russian “trolls” used social media to negatively influence political discourse during the 2016 presidential election, saw the barest of silver linings after a quick perusal of the data: There did not appear to be any targeted efforts by trolls or foreign agents to weaponize the story.

The downside: That means the story and its offshoots that perpetuated further misinformed tweets spread organically. That, Linvill said, is a particularly hard kind of disinformation to neutralize.

“Spin is very hard to counter because people want to believe what they’re already inclined to believe … it’s really difficult to stop and properly assess the information. That’s fundamentally how good disinformation works,” Linvill said. “And it’s even more difficult because [the Buttigieg quote] wasn’t a lie, it was a mistake.""

AD

AD

Getting incorrect information from a credible source is especially hard to combat, he said. Journalism ethicists have long warned that corrections never reach the full audience of an initial mistake. Linvill said he noticed, however, some people who saw the Buttigieg correction were unmoved by the facts.

“[What’s] scary is that if you look at the replies to Evan Halper’s retraction, [it’s] the number of people who say, ‘I don’t believe you’ — in reference to his retraction,” Linvill said.

Journalism experts agreed mistakes are serious but also inevitable. They said Halper, the L.A. Times reporter, did the right thing by owning his mistake and explaining why it happened (“the result of transcribing a noisy recording at a loud rally,” he tweeted in his correction). Halper went on to share Buttigieg’s full quote in context:

AD

AD

“I think because I come from a part of the country where normal has been a real problem for a very long time, and I think the failures of the old normal help explain how we got to Trump, I am much more interested in building a future that is going to have a lot of differences.”

“My biggest concern isn’t this particular error — my concern is that it’s one more matchstick thrown on the bonfire of people distrusting the media across the political divide,” said Vivian Schiller, CEO of the Civil Foundation, a media nonprofit focused on sustainability and transparency in journalism.

“Now we live in an era [where] you unleash a story and you lose control of it immediately,” she added.

AD

By the time the correction was issued, the misquote had already taken on a life of its own: Various news outlets published stories about the statement (many later issued corrections on their report of the quote); Buttigieg competitors like former HUD Secretary Julián Castro tweeted (then later deleted) rebukes of Buttigieg; former vice president Joe Biden fired off a conspicuously timed tweet praising Obama.

AD

“The minute the reporter retracted the quote, it went from misinformation to disinformation,” Schiller said, drawing a distinction between inaccurate information borne of honest mistakes and intentional efforts to deceive. “Anyone still propagating and ginning up conspiracy theories about it now knows full well that the correction has been issued. They’re taking misinformation [and weaponizing] it into disinformation.”

It is unknown whether the mistake will have a lingering impact on Buttigieg’s campaign. On Twitter, he was gracious about the mistake and took the opportunity to reaffirm his appreciation of Obama.

I appreciate this reporter’s swift and honest correction of a misquote on my views of the Obama presidency. From health care to DADT repeal to the rescue of the auto industry, my appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place. https://t.co/eWvSDtcpTQ — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) November 11, 2019

The Glezmans’ story, with all its rifts, love and sadness, became a private matter gone painfully public. Religious conservatives and gay rights activists across America took sides, and a once-close family was pulled further apart.

The split is resonating even more since Chasten, a 30-year-old former schoolteacher, has attracted his own enthusiastic following and begun holding solo campaign events separate from Buttigieg.

“I think in some ways he’s modeling what kind of a first spouse he might be,” Buttigieg said on a recent bus tour through Iowa, of Chasten’s visits to schools and LGBTQ centers. “I talk about my story, [but] I think his story is even more of somebody whose life has really been shaped by the political decisions of others.”

Beyond the primary, it’s not clear how the broader electorate will react to a candidate who is in a same-sex marriage, something that’s never been tested on the presidential level before.

A family split goes public

The Glezman family’s strains erupted several months ago when Chasten told The Washington Post about his childhood in Michigan and his anxiety about coming out in high school. He recounted giving his parents a letter — he was afraid to say “I’m gay” aloud — and said his mother responded by asking whether he was sick, perhaps with AIDS.

That prompted a silence in the household so hostile he was forced to leave home for a while, Chasten said. The article quoted Chasten saying of his brothers, “We never got over it,” and Rhyan adding, “I just don’t support the gay lifestyle.”

The next day, Rhyan woke up to dozens of messages calling him a bigot, a homophobe and worse. “It kind of blindsided me,” Rhyan said.

Beyond that, he felt Christianity itself was under assault. So after much prayer, he reached out to Faithwire.com to tell his side of the story, prompting the headline, “Pete Buttigieg’s pastor brother-in-law blasts ‘false narrative’ in WaPo report smearing him as ‘bigot.’ ” Other right-leaning outlets soon jumped on the story.

AD

In Rhyan’s telling, their parents were in fact very supportive of Chasten, and it was Rhyan who got the cold shoulder when he announced he was giving himself to Jesus.

Now he says Buttigieg’s candidacy is giving him a way to defend the faith. “If I’m able to help extend the truth of Jesus, if I’m able to help unify the LGBT community and evangelicals together as human beings . . . in a small way, I’m definitely open,” Rhyan said. “I’m very grateful and very humbled by the new, I guess you could say, platform.”

The Buttigieg campaign declined requests for Chasten to comment for this article, but emphasized that Rhyan Glezman does not speak for the family. Buttigieg himself, while not directly addressing the attacks on Chasten, says the Gospel’s message is to protect those less fortunate. In speeches, he has directed a question to Vice President Pence that in a sense is aimed at religious conservatives more broadly: “Is it that he stopped believing in Scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump?”

The Glezmans’ story may seem almost biblical, but unlike Cain and Abel or Jacob and Esau, Rhyan and Chasten have a middle brother. Dustin Glezman, neither preacher nor politico but a landscaper in Georgia, has tried to avoid the spotlight.

And it largely worked, until a reporter from the Daily Mail showed up at his house. Dustin told him he agreed with Rhyan that the family had never mistreated Chasten.

In an interview, Dustin said he is taken aback by the way his ordinary Midwestern family is being wracked by the furor around his brother-in-law’s campaign.

“I’ve seen [what happened to] my older brother, how it all blew up,” Dustin said. “I’m just a little guy here in Georgia. I don’t think we had any issues until all this started. When Pete started running for president, I think that’s when everything started getting more distant, you know what I mean?”

Sticking up for 'Little Glez'

The Glezman brothers grew up in a Catholic household in Traverse City, Mich., where religion was a quiet underpinning but not a center of conversation. Their memories diverge regarding their parents’ political leanings: Chasten describes his parents as conservative, while Rhyan and Dustin remember them as liberal.

The two older brothers played just about any sport they could. “I would honestly say I had an amazing childhood,” said Dustin, recalling summers on the family pontoon boat on Michigan’s lakes. “I can’t remember any negative thing. We had everything.”

Chasten’s memories, though, are more complicated. He was “Mom’s boy” — shopping, going to movies and working around the house with Sherri Glezman — while his brothers went hunting and worked on trucks with Terry Glezman. (Sherri and Terry Glezman declined interview requests.)

“We definitely didn’t spend a lot of time together in harmony,” Chasten told The Post in April.

At school, Rhyan and Dustin were jocks while Chasten was called “Little Glez,” a nickname he didn’t love. He struggled with a sense that he didn’t fit in with his athletic brothers. In his high school of 1,500, he knew of no students or teachers who were openly gay; he came out after graduating.

“It was simply unsafe to be out, it was unsafe to be gay,” he would say later.

Once, when he was getting picked on in the hallway, he remembers Dustin stepping in and throwing his tormentor against a locker. He told him not to mess with his brother again, then immediately walked away, according to Chasten.

AD

“I don’t think he wanted his brother to be hurt, and he probably was embarrassed that somebody probably thought that I was gay,” Chasten said. “That’s not to say that my brothers would never have stuck up for me — because they did, on multiple occasions. We were just in different tribes.”

Skull tattoo, 'Cowboy Bible'

Today, Rhyan’s right arm is covered in tattoos. A large skull on the forearm and a cluster of smaller skulls leading to his shoulder are reminders of what he calls his “pre-Christian” past as a partyer and wild man.

Rhyan embraced religion a few years after college, and he grew quiet recently when asked how that decision was received by his family. Speaking generally, he said some people did not believe him, and others assumed it was a phase.

AD

One day last year when Rhyan was on the phone with Dustin, his middle brother also decided to become an evangelical Christian. The two now talk regularly, and Dustin occasionally watches online as Rhyan leads church services.

Rhyan says he longs to reconcile with his youngest brother, too. “I do look for that day,” he said. “But reconciliation is a two-way street.”

Rhyan said he loves Chasten and sees everyone as a child of God. When he reads online comments calling him a bigot, he doesn’t understand how anyone can think so. “The best for anyone — my brother or anyone — is recognizing their need for Jesus,” Rhyan said.

AD

But for Chasten, rejecting homosexuality is rejecting who he is. “We still live in a country where we have to second-guess whether it is okay for us to talk about our husbands and our wives,” Chasten said in June to the Ingham County, Mich., Democrats.

“When the stranger on the airplane tells you about his wife and his kids and then asks you, ‘So what about you?’ is it okay for me to say, ‘I live with my husband in Indiana?’ I still have to ask myself that every day.”

When Rhyan graduated from college, he struggled to find a career, working as a police officer and then a mixed martial arts fighter. By 2012, he was married and running a landscaping business.

But he still felt empty, he says — until, looking for some kind of sign, he descended to the basement and retrieved a book he’d received years earlier called “The Cowboy Bible,” adorned with a man on a horse. His eyes fell on a passage: “Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.”

AD

Later that day he was talking to a friend, and he spontaneously quoted the same passage, even though he’d had no idea Rhyan had been reading the Bible that day. Rhyan felt a jolt; this was the divine message he’d been seeking.

The next morning, he wept. “Up to this point, I was a very kind of rough, gruff, don’t-cry type of person, and I had this overwhelming emotion come over me that I just, I couldn’t explain,” Rhyan said. “So from that day forward, I just completely surrendered.”

He showed up at a nearby church, grew more involved and eventually felt called to become a pastor.

Two versions of Christianity

The Community Church of God, which Rhyan now leads, sits on a grassy lot in Clio, a tiny city north of Flint, Mich., with a population of 2,500. He took the stage on a recent Sunday following a performance of Christian worship songs, telling the crowd of about 80 that the day’s sermon would be about authentic vs. inauthentic Christianity.

“Anyone can claim to be a Christian,” he said. “I could say I play for the Chicago Bulls.”

He spoke faster, almost spitting out the words. “Our opinions really don’t matter. Our opinions should not matter. What we think Christianity should be like?” He let his disdain for that notion hang in the air. “What does God’s word say for his children?”

“Amen,” a woman’s voice rose from the audience.

Buttigieg, in contrast, speaks on the campaign trail both about his Christianity and his support for gay rights — a position Rhyan considers deeply anti-Christian.

Over the summer months, as the Democratic primary heated up, it became especially galling to Rhyan to see Buttigieg repeatedly depicting the Christian right as hypocritical and saying it failed to stand up for the oppressed, including gay people.

“You shouldn’t be misrepresenting the Bible and publicly contradicting God’s word,” Rhyan said. “He’s manipulating stories in the Scripture to make his points.”

Rhyan says he nonetheless tried to lay low and avoid a second flare-up — until late summer when he saw clips of a Buttigieg interview with the radio show “The Breakfast Club,” where he characterized abortion as a complex issue.

“There’s a lot of parts of the Bible,” Buttigieg said on the show. “Even that is something that we can interpret differently.”

Rhyan took to Twitter to blast Buttigieg for his “false religion.” Soon, a producer from Tucker Carlson’s show reached out to Rhyan, and once again he was in a studio in Detroit, this time as a Fox News illustration of “Saint Pete” flashed on-screen.

“I would like to make a plea to Pete Buttigieg, my brother-in-law, that he would reconsider his position and the way he is misrepresenting Scripture to push this pro-abortion platform that he’s pushing,” Rhyan said.

The first gentleman of South Bend

As that side of the debate plays out, Chasten is sending a very different message, through tweets, campaign talks and other venues, about tolerance, feminism and gay rights.

“So here’s the thing,” he posted recently. “You can look at that tweet...(that really nasty tweet. The gross, homophobic tweet. The blatantly racist tweet. The ‘fire you up with fake outrage’ click-bait news article tweet) and just say ‘nope.’ Scroll away. Don’t engage. Adios gross tweet. Not today.”

As Buttigieg’s star has risen, so too has Chasten’s. A former teacher at a Montessori school, the “first gentleman of South Bend” has amassed nearly 400,000 Twitter followers.

At first, Chasten mostly stood to the side as his husband gave speeches and worked the crowds. Not anymore. In recent months, the 30-year-old has hosted numerous solo campaign events, usually fundraisers that command anywhere between $25 and $1,000 per ticket. His Twitter account alternates between inspirational messages, references to their dogs, tributes to Buttigieg and gentle teasing of his husband.

Whatever they felt when their son came out, the Glezman parents have since embraced Chasten as well as Buttigieg. In his memoir, the mayor describes how Terry Glezman leveled the parking lot of their wedding venue the night before the ceremony; the next day, both parents walked Chasten down the aisle.

The Buttigieg campaign noted Chasten’s parents have attended several campaign events. At a recent meet-and-greet in their hometown, when Chasten broke down recalling the struggles of coming out, Sherri Glezman discreetly stepped onstage with a tissue.

“My parents are incredible, because they’ve always tried to hold this family together,” Chasten told The Post in April. “They just want everyone to be happy. . . . I think my mom wants nothing more than for all of us to sit around the table again. And it breaks her heart, and it breaks my heart for her, that she will never have that.”

On a Saturday in late June, Chasten held court at the Traverse City pride festival, an event that didn’t exist when he was in high school. Behind him, colorful balloons spelled out “PRIDE.” In front of him stood 5,000 exuberant festival-goers, including his parents.

Chasten told the crowd they had made it. They had survived the closet and the ridicule and would no longer tolerate anyone who made them feel lesser.

“You’re here. You are perfect just the way you are in this space,” Chasten said. “Love is love, and that is enough.”

It felt good, Chasten told everyone, to be home."

Buttigieg is leading the field in the Iowa caucuses in the latest Monmouth University poll. He has 22 percent of the vote, with former vice president Joe Biden (19 percent), Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18 percent) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (13 percent) behind him. Klobuchar has 5 percent.

That’s better than Buttigieg is performing nationally. In the most recent Washington Post/ABC poll, he’s at 9 percent. But that’s still better than Klobuchar (2 percent).

On Sunday, the senator expounded upon her earlier comments in a CNN interview.

“The last point I made in that article was that of the women on the stage — I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators — Senator Harris, Senator Warren and myself,” Klobuchar said on CNN. “Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t. Maybe we’re held to a different standard.”

Some people wrongly accused Klobuchar of suggesting that Buttigieg was not experienced enough to be a top-tier presidential candidate — or perhaps to even run for office. The day of Klobuchar’s interview, VoteVets, a liberal nonprofit focusing on veterans issues, used its Twitter account to push back on the idea that Buttigieg doesn’t have experience.

We've heard people say @PeteButtigieg doesn't have experience. Those who served in war have real world experience & perspective relatively few others in America have.#VeteransDay is good time for those people to apologize to Pete, and all vets, for minimizing their experience. — VoteVets (@votevets) November 11, 2019

But that is not what the lawmaker said. When host Jake Tapper asked Klobuchar whether she thought Buttigieg was “qualified period,” she answered “yes.”

Other prominent Democratic women backed up Klobuchar’s belief that a woman whose most significant public office experience was being a mayor of a town of 100,000 would never be in the running to be the Democratic Party’s nominee for president of the United States.

Patti Solis Doyle, who worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, said Klobuchar was “absolutely 100 percent right on this one.”

“It’s no secret that sexism plays a role in politics and government. It’s no secret that women have to work twice as hard, be twice as good, to get half the credit,” she said on CNN on Monday. “It’s why we’ve never elected a female president.”

Buttigieg acknowledged that women were at a disadvantage last month when he told CNN that sexism in politics is hurting female candidates.

“Sexism is a real force in politics right now,” he said. “I think it would be naive for me to say that that hasn’t played some role to the disadvantage of female candidates and to the advantage of male candidates” like him.

AD

Klobuchar’s statement actually invokes controversial ideas about electability — the often vague concept about who has the skills, traits and characteristics needed to defeat President Trump in the upcoming election. According to a September Washington Post-ABC News poll, just 7 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independents said that a woman would be more likely to defeat Trump in 2020. Another 23 percent said a man would be more likely to beat Trump, and a 69 percent majority said it didn’t matter.

AD

This argument that people are backing Buttigieg who would not back a woman with a similar résumé is a difficult one for a female candidate to make without harming herself in the process. Some supporters of Buttigieg will hear Klobuchar calling them sexist. Whether it will move those voters to reconsider Klobuchar’s candidacy is another thing. But this might have been a risk worth taking for Klobuchar, a candidate who can’t drop much further in the polls, and perhaps as a result enjoys the freedom that can come with not having much to lose.

AD

What could be more interesting to watch in that framing is whether Warren runs with it at any point. Warren has said she’s experienced some sexism in her presidential race and praised Buttigieg for acknowledging in the past that he is enjoying some advantages because he is a man.

When asked whether she agreed with Klobuchar comments on Pete, @ewarren said “@PeteButtigieg said that’s the case, he agreed with Sen. Klobuchar and I appreciate his recognizing that he gets a certain advantage by being male. That’s what he said.” — Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou (@misyrlena) November 11, 2019

Despite their experience, there are actually reasons that some voters could prefer Buttigieg over the other women — and particularly Klobuchar — that aren’t because of sexism. Interrogating those things could be instrumental in Klobuchar and her opponents discovering why they aren’t doing as well with voters as Buttigieg. But the mayor more or less backing up the lawmaker’s point could also challenge some of his supporters to ask themselves if they would be as supportive of Buttigieg if he didn’t remind them of JFK or Obama, but were a woman instead.

For seven months after Michael Bloomberg first passed on running for president in 2020, the former New York City mayor and his tight team of political advisers reviewed the constant flow of polling data they kept commissioning from all over the country and felt mostly okay. The tycoon was at some version of peace about his decision to stay out of the fray — just like he had in 2016 and 2008 — largely because Joe Biden looked well positioned to win the Democratic primary, and then to beat Donald Trump. Bloomberg almost definitely would’ve gotten into the race if the former vice-president wasn’t looking so strong in the spring, his friends said at the time. And for the next six months-plus, they repeated that intel to themselves, to their colleagues, and to anyone who pointed out that Biden, 2020’s moderate standard-bearer, was hardly a strong front-runner. Bloomberg himself was watching closely, of course, trusting in Biden but wondering aloud in private with increasing agitation as the year matured — just like everyone else — about whether anyone in the field was truly ready to beat Trump. But the data, for seven months, held up.

Then Bloomberg’s privately commissioned polls started telling a different story. As news of Trump’s attempted Ukraine extortion spread in September, Bloomberg’s team saw “a shift: Democrats becoming hyper-focused on the issue of electability. It was always a consideration. But becoming hyper-focused,” Howard Wolfson, a top Bloomberg adviser, told New York. “There are obviously plenty of Democrats who are very excited about voting for the most progressive candidate, but what we have seen is there is a large number of Democrats who want to vote for the candidate with the best shot of winning.” Most important, it was no longer obvious to Bloomberg’s team, looking at data showing a weakened Biden — having faced constant attacks and questions about his durability and fitness to match up against Trump — was still that candidate. To Bloomberg, a Bloomberg-shaped opening was finally emerging, just like he’d quietly been musing about for months to associates and political supporters, including a handful of current and former elected officials. “He’s been thinking about this for a long time,” said former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who said he had no advance notice of Bloomberg’s decision. “The thinking is, ‘Does it look like Biden has imploded?’ And obviously it’s looked more and more that way recently,” added a New York power player close with the Bloomberg team.

Biden’s team, of course, doesn’t see it this way, and its immediate concern was that Bloomberg’s entry would freeze the former VP’s already-lagging fundraising. Within hours after the first Thursday Times report of his latest moves, some top Biden aides and allies began calling their current and prospective major donors to reassure them, and to gauge their feelings about Bloomberg’s potential candidacy, according to Democrats familiar with some such conversations. Some big fish either didn’t immediately respond to the calls or told the Biden team to give them some more time — they now had to reconsider given the news.

Bloomberg’s move to start getting his name on primary ballots isn’t a final decision on a full-scale campaign, but it is a new, public stage of an evolving conversation he has been having with supporters and allies for years, especially in the last two. One of the party’s two biggest donors over the last decade, he’s remained wired in: He privately discussed a potential run last year with Democratic honchos including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrats briefed on the talks said, and he’s kept in touch with others like Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, as the presidential race has evolved. Over the spring and into the summer he made no secret to associates about his preference for a centrist candidate like Biden, and his displeasure with Bernie Sanders and the ascendant Elizabeth Warren. (Sometimes this poked into public view: “I just said to Sen. Warren on the way out, ‘Senator, congratulations, it’s a nice talk. But let me just remind you if my company hadn’t been successful, we wouldn’t be here today, so enough with this stuff,’” Bloomberg joked to the audience at a Des Moines gun-safety forum in August.)

Then, in recent weeks, members of his political team, led by strategist Kevin Sheekey, ramped up their outreach to politically powerful New Yorkers over dinners and drinks. The invitees hardly needed reminding that Bloomberg — worth $52 billion, according to Forbes — had talked about spending $1 billion on an independent run in 2016, and could easily drop that much now, too.

The would-be candidate himself is not yet 100 percent convinced that he will run. Early filing deadlines for ballot access in some states forced him to go public with his possible intentions last week. But over the last few days those around Bloomberg have been working to convince political allies and potential supporters that this is for real: “Get ready,” they keep saying. And after the news broke, Bloomberg himself — notoriously not one for glad-handing — made a round of calls that would be expected of a presidential candidate, including to Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez and the chairmen of the state parties in Iowa and New Hampshire, operatives aware of the calls told New York.

Still, even some of his closest ideological and business allies in New York and Washington aren’t sure just how seriously to take it yet, after almost none of them got any heads-up that Bloomberg was seriously reconsidering the race. Many have requested calls or briefings from Bloomberg or his lieutenants, hoping to understand exactly where they see room for him in the race when polling shows the electorate is not actually dissatisfied with the primary field — just 4 percent said they were undecided because of a lack of good choices in a USC/Los Angeles Times survey last week. Bloomberg would also enter the race with national support between that of Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang and with the highest unfavorability rating of any Democrat — at least before unleashing his inevitable torrent of money for ads.

“This is ridiculous,” one New York Democrat in regular, friendly contact with Team Bloomberg told me. “I love those guys,” he said. But “you will not be able to find an individual who is not on their payroll who’ll say this is a good idea.”

THE PROSPECT THAT’S making many of the skeptics from the center-left particularly nervous is Bloomberg’s entry weakening support for Biden and Pete Buttigieg, arguably the two leading moderates in the race, while also himself not winning. That could clear Warren or Sanders’s path to the nomination, while giving them reason to go extra-heavy on billionaire bashing. Already both of them have made political hay of yet another tycoon’s interest in the race, as have others like Yang, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker.

But Bloomberg looks like he’s trying to find a way around that outcome, employing a new game plan altogether. The idea is to skip the first four states in the nominating process, where every other candidate has already spent months and millions of dollars, and to instead build up operations in the states that vote in March, when the field will presumably be less crowded. The plan was almost immediately compared to Rudy Giuliani’s ill-fated attempt to do something similar in 2008 by not seriously contesting any states until Florida, though in reality Giuliani did briefly try to compete in the preceding states, but failed. Bloomberg, too, spent time in Iowa and New Hampshire when he was first considering a run earlier this year. In any case, it’s too late for him to try organizing them now.

The revelation of this strategy has infuriated the traditional gatekeepers in the states that usually play the biggest roles in the process. The idea came into public view in a series of reports on Friday, thanks to Wolfson, who along with Sheekey, ad maker Bill Knapp, and pollster Doug Schoen have long made up Bloomberg’s inner circle, though the mayor has also brought on Brynne Craig, a veteran of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, and worked with top Barack Obama campaign alums Mitch Stewart and Dan Wagner. Both Iowa and New Hampshire’s Democratic Party chairs almost immediately made a point of their “disappointment” (read: fury) that a candidate would skip their contests, which are central to the nominating path but constantly under threat from reformers who want to change it. The latter’s Raymond Buckley warned, “It’s unfortunate that Michael Bloomberg doesn’t want to participate in this invaluable, important, and unique primary process and be tested in the same way that the other Democratic candidates have been and will be.” But it also sparked speculation that he’s positioning himself as a white-knight candidate who could step in if Biden collapses in the first four states. It’s a plan of attack that fits perfectly with Bloomberg’s likeliest preferred campaign tactic: blanketing states with television ads and paid organizers, rather than personally stopping through diners to greet voters day after day, and trying to lead rousing rallies. “They’re looking for a coronation,” griped a senior Democratic strategist who’s worked closely with the Bloomberg operation for years. “Is he really willing to do the retail thing? Billions in ads don’t get you where you need to be. Just look at Tom Steyer.”

The entry of a well-funded, well-known candidate swooping in just as huge states begin voting could also raise the probability of a contested convention come July, warned one longtime Bloomberg associate currently being courted by both the former mayor and the former vice-president. Others who’d voiced a similar concern about Steyer — the hedge-fund billionaire and environmental and impeachment activist and the only person to spend more on Democratic politics than Bloomberg in the last decade — worried it could draw Bloomberg’s attention from his funding of liberal operations around the country, particularly around voter data and climate and gun-control issues. He’s talked about spending half a billion dollars on that work this election cycle. (“The Democrats owe him a tremendous amount of credit,” said McAuliffe, whom Bloomberg supported in his 2013 gubernatorial run, and who at one point discussed a campaign role with Biden. “I have nothing but great things to say about him.”) Bloomberg has not indicated that he would put these projects aside, and those close to him find that unlikely. But some leading party operatives who acknowledge how reliant they are on his cash and network are still nervous about the left’s funding and organizing future if he were to focus more on the campaign.

Even some of the Democrats closest to Bloomberg aren’t sure this is anything more than a trial balloon to see how voters and the media treat him before fully committing. Or, in the words of one of his longtime backers who is now on Team Biden, “an insurance policy” that might never be tapped. For one thing, it’s far from clear that Bloomberg — a former Republican and Independent — would be able to make many Biden supporters think twice. The ex-VP’s base, after all, is not suburban moderates so much as non-college-educated white voters and African-Americans in states like South Carolina. “This could be famous last words, but this may be like Wesley Clark entering, getting single digits, then not getting anywhere,” said one powerful state Democratic Party chair who hasn’t heard from Bloomberg, repeating a popular comparison to the general who entered the 2004 race in September of 2003, then flopped. Then there are Bloomberg’s repeated flirtations with running since 2006. “Until I hear Mike say, on the record, ‘I’m in,’ I won’t believe it,” another top New York City political operator close to Bloomberg’s team told me.

Even if Bloomberg ultimately decides against a run, he’s already changed the dynamics of the race for some major candidates and moneymen. For one, his tentative entry sucked up all the oxygen in the 2020 media room for the weekend, lightening the scrutiny Warren had been receiving for her Medicare for All funding plan and allowing her to regain an offensive posture by coming out swinging against his candidacy. Meanwhile, “you’re going to have billionaires out there crying tears of joy for their savior,” said a well-connected East Coast fundraiser who’s spoken extensively with Bloomberg and his deputies in recent months. “The Bloomberg people are going to have to convince them to calm down.” A few minutes after we hung up, investor Leon Cooperman — who’s recently been attacking Warren like he did Obama in 2011 — said he’d back Bloomberg, and the next day Recode reported that Jeff Bezos had asked him to run earlier this year.

But that plutocratic brand of exuberance has its limits. Some of Bloomberg’s friends said they’re concerned that if the mayor pumps the brakes, this renewed flirtation with 2020 runs the risk of already having backfired. It hasn’t just given the populist left’s preferred candidates an easy applause line, a handful worried over the weekend, it may have cast yet another shadow over a Biden campaign that could use as much sunlight as possible these days.

“I don’t see how this doesn’t hand the nomination to Warren,” sighed a Manhattan financier, a longtime Bloomberg supporter who’d tried nudging him toward running late last year and early in 2019. This spring, after Bloomberg initially said he wouldn’t run, the financier considered a range of other candidates before settling on backing Biden. He continued, “I don’t see how this isn’t the most destructive thing he could possibly do.”"

It shows a three-person race, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg joining Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden at the top of the field. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) trails just behind.

It’s a big change for Buttigieg who, in Monmouth’s August poll, was under 10 percent. He’s improved by 14 points, ignoring the role of margins of error for the moment.

That’s going to be the focal point of a lot of coverage of the new poll, and understandably so. But the snapshot we were handed was something like a picture of a crowded field on the stretch turn, a number of horses, any of which have some shot at crossing the line first. Buttigieg joined the pack, but it remains to be seen whether he can keep running with them.

One indicator that he can is that he’s the combined first or second choice of 37 percent of likely caucusgoers. That’s about where Warren is, at 35 percent. Warren’s position on that metric has held steady since August, when she was the first or second choice of 38 percent of Iowans. Biden dropped from 38 percent, then to 29 percent now.

It’s important to remember, too, that this isn’t a normal race. It’s not simply that each candidate is racing to cross the finish line and the person with the most support earns the delegates. Instead, the Iowa caucuses use a threshold underneath which support gets redistributed. That’s where the second-choice question becomes particularly significant: If Sanders doesn’t get 15 percent support at a caucus site, for example, his supporters have to go to another candidate. Being the most popular second choice means more in Iowa than it does elsewhere.

That system does admittedly break our horse-race analogy.

What’s particularly notable in Monmouth’s poll is the factor highlighted by the pollsters themselves, who published their results under the headline, “Few Caucusgoers Tied to 2020 Choice.” The race is very fluid, and a lot of people indicate that they’re willing to change their minds.

Specifically, only about a third of respondents say that they’re firmly committed to a candidate or that there’s only a low possibility they’ll change their minds. About half say they’re more flexible. That sort of flexibility is what leads to 14-point jumps in the polls.

(It’s worth noting that Buttigieg, in addition to earning the most support, was the candidate most likely to be identified as someone voters had seen in person. A third of respondents said they’d seen a candidate in person. Seventeen percent said they had seen Buttigieg. By contrast, 11 percent said they had seen Biden.)

Buttigieg also probably benefits from not being the target of much negative attention from his opponents. His net favorability (those who view him favorably minus those who don’t) remained high since August. Biden and Warren both saw their net favorabilities drop. In Warren’s case, that’s probably partly a function of how much fire she took at the most recent Democratic debate, itself a function of her surge in the polls.

This, too, doesn’t translate well to our horse-race analogy. The horse in the lead is … the target of people throwing rotten fruit or something? As they race to a finish line at which point the trailing horses have to join the leading horses’ teams? Is that right?

AD

AD

The Monmouth poll also undercuts that analogy in the most direct way. At any given moment, the position of half the horses in the field could just suddenly change dramatically. It’s like a horse race with changing rules taking place on a flood plain during a monsoon. A snapshot of what’s happening is by no means useless, but it takes about six minutes of explanation before you can understand what you might be looking at.

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent is slightly closer to Warren than she is to Biden. Bloomberg sits in sixth place with 4 percent.

This is not to say that Bloomberg couldn’t catch on, especially if Biden falls short in early states. However, it does throw cold water on the notion he could breeze into the race in March having skipped the four early states and expect to be competitive. If he is not competitive now, imagine where he will be in four months after one or more contenders have won contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

If Biden does falter early on, there is every reason to believe one of the candidates already in the race will move in to scoop up Biden voters before Bloomberg finds his footing. Buttigieg is annoying his rivals, peeved that he is connecting with voters, especially in Iowa where his polling and crowd size continue rising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is into the December debate and now is pushing back against Buttigieg on grounds of experience:

“Of the women on the stage… do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that [Mayor Pete Buttigieg] had? No, I don’t. Maybe we’re held to a different standard.” - Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Mayor Buttigieg’s qualifications #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/xz0cEH86OZ — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 10, 2019

A race between two non-elderly and super-articulate moderates, I would suggest, would be the interesting battle for Biden votes, especially in the primaries in the Midwest and South where New York’s ex-mayor does not equate with “electable” in the minds of many Democratic voters. A young mayor and Afghanistan War veteran vs. a more experienced female senator would be an engaging contest, the party well-served by the competition and well-represented should either of them prevail.

Klobuchar likely struck a cord with regular Democratic voters when she declared, “I don’t think you just waltz in and say, instead of ‘I’m good enough to be president,’ your argument is the other people aren’t good enough — that is not how we’ve been conducting these debates.” She added, “When people look at the White House and see this multimillionaire — including, by the way, independents and moderate Republicans — and now he’s messing up so many things, I don’t think they say, ‘Oh, we need someone richer.' I think you have to earn votes and not buy them.” Touché.

In short, the notion that the Democratic Party needs another old, white rich guy to save itself from the clutches of Warren is a bit preposterous. For starters, Warren is doing a fine job slowing her own momentum by tossing out a rainbows-and-unicorns Medicare-for-all plan (and then refusing to defend it on the merits from a torrent of criticism). Meanwhile, moderates are still sticking with Biden and have not one but two fine alternatives should he crumble. Maybe the media have been pining to write Bloomberg stories, but so far there is little indication that Democratic primary voters are pining for his candidacy. Indeed, the odds that Bloomberg will never enter the race at all seem better than the odds he will do much to affect it.

With Simmons’s help, Sanders (I-Vt.) — along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — is working frantically to narrow Biden’s commanding lead among South Carolina’s African Americans, who make up just under two-thirds of the state’s Democratic voters.

Rather than attack Biden directly, his rivals are mostly deploying tactics that include church visits and tailgate parties, and holding private conversations and teaming up with young influencers who can spread the word. The Feb. 29 South Carolina primary will be a pivotal sign of minority support three days before Super Tuesday, which itself features 15 states, including California and Texas.

Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg have each faced obstacles attracting support from black voters, a challenge that has been apparent as each has drawn increasingly large and excited, albeit mostly white, crowds to campaign events. Biden has held a wide lead in South Carolina since he entered the race, the beneficiary of wide name recognition, decades of trips to South Carolina and, as Simmons points out, a stamp of approval earned serving in the White House under Barack Obama.

“He does have long-standing, deep and abiding relationships in South Carolina — they’re real,” Columbia Mayor Stephen K. Benjamin said. “There’s some catch-up that everyone else is doing.”

In the interest of catching up, Biden’s rivals are trying to play to whatever strengths they have. Warren is making appeals to black women. Buttigieg and Sanders are aiming at younger activists, largely ceding the older generation to Biden.

The goal for Biden’s rivals, at least for now, is not to overtake him among black voters but to come out of the South Carolina primary with at least a respectable showing, Democratic strategists say — and to be well positioned in case Biden stumbles in Iowa or New Hampshire, which hold votes shortly before South Carolina.

AD

To date, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg have all held events in predominantly black areas of South Carolina — only to have the voters who show up be overwhelmingly white. Biden, in contrast, touts his solid support from African Americans as evidence of his political strength.

“I’m the only person in this race that has support from every constituency that we have,” including young people, Biden told reporters recently. “I have more from African Americans. I have more support from them than anyone. The Democratic Party is a big tent, and in order to win you have to reach out and win parts of all the constituencies.”

The latest Monmouth Poll in South Carolina gave Biden 39 percent support among African American Democratic primary voters, compared with 11 percent for Warren and Sanders and 8 percent for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is black. Buttigieg is at 1 percent among black voters.

Warren’s counteroffensive includes 40-plus organizers and 10 field offices across the state, including small places like rural Orangeburg, a city of about 13,000 where 75 percent of the residents are black. Away from journalists and rallies, she is holding private sit-downs with influential undecided black women.

Hours before taking the stage at a recent forum at historically black Benedict College, Warren sat down at her hotel for an ask-anything Q&A with a small group of elected black women and other influencers.

“Those women represent hundreds and hundreds of voters in their circles,” said state Rep. Wendy C. Brawley, a Warren supporter who is helping the candidate make such connections.

AD

Warren did not explicitly ask for an endorsement as the attendees munched on muffins and fruit. Rather, she encouraged the women to keep an open mind about her candidacy, answered questions and listened to criticism.

AD

“It was very open — ask anything you want,” said Columbia City Council member Tameika Isaac Devine. “Someone asked why she hadn’t been to South Carolina more. And somebody asked did she feel like she was too liberal to bring the country together.”

It is not clear that Warren’s answers persuaded anyone, but the campaign hopes such events plant seeds. A few hours later, Warren stopped by the historic Bethel AME Church in Columbia for a private meeting with another small group of black voters.

AD

Buttigieg, the youngest candidate at 37, is focusing much of his South Carolina outreach on historically black colleges and universities. He recently hosted a tailgate party at Allen University's homecoming football game.

A DJ hired by the campaign eschewed Buttigieg’s usual rally song — “High Hopes” by the alternative rock band Panic! At the Disco — in favor of rap and hip-hop. “We ain’t playing no ‘High Hopes’ here,” one organizer quipped.

AD

The event was organized in part by Walter A. Clyburn Reed, grandson of Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a powerful figure in South Carolina politics. The elder Clyburn has not endorsed a presidential candidate, though he is a longtime friend of Biden’s and has worked with Warren in Congress.

AD

“As you know, 2020 is coming up,” Reed exhorted the small crowd at the Oct. 26 tailgate. “If you didn’t vote in 2016, I understand. If you didn’t vote in 2018, I understand. But in 2020, it’s not a game.”

Reed regularly notes his grandfather’s support for his political activity on social media, sometimes using the hashtag #BlackAndProud4Pete.

Buttigieg likes to cite what he calls the Douglass Plan, an elaborate racial justice proposal he rolled out in July. It would direct a quarter of government contracts to minority businesses and cut the federal and state incarceration rate, among other steps.

AD

Buttigieg persuaded hundreds of prominent black South Carolinians to sign onto the plan even if they are not supporting his candidacy. His campaign then trumpeted these signatures in a way that forced figures such as Devine, for one, to clarify that she was not endorsing Buttigieg.

AD

But as Buttigieg tries to build relationships with black voters, his problems outside South Carolina echo within it. In June, a white police officer in South Bend, where Buttigieg is mayor, shot a black man, setting off weeks of protests.

More recently, Buttigieg distanced himself from a supporter named Steve Patton, a former Chicago city attorney who tried to block the release of a video showing the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, angering many black leaders.

Patton was set to co-host a fundraiser for Buttigieg last month. He was ultimately removed from that role, but Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said the matter should have set off Buttigieg’s “natural radar” much earlier.

AD

AD

“Every time he seems to go three steps forward, something happens . . . and it takes him six steps backwards,” Seawright said of Buttigieg’s outreach to black voters. The campaign, he said, must get “a better handle on the things they can control if they want a better shot of making inroads within the African American community.”

Sanders’s African American backers say his message of revolutionary change has particular relevance for the black community. Sanders surrogates recently took a “Medicare for Y’all” tour through the state, in part to expound on how the candidate’s Medicare-for-all plan would help African Americans.

One Sanders supporter, South Carolina State Rep. Ivory Thigpen, has been touting the Vermont senator to members of his church. In a flier that has been mailed around Columbia, Thigpen says Sanders’s agenda is “driven by compassion: compassion in health care, in the criminal justice system, and economic justice.”

AD

In an interview, Thigpen said Democrats must nominate a candidate who can electrify black voters and others. He suggested that’s not Biden.

“Have you ever been to a Trump rally? You should see the energy,” Thigpen said. “They’re turning over tables, they’re pushing around stuff. It’s a heightened level of excitement. Will the Democratic Party with its nominee be able to match that type of energy?”

Two black candidates in the race, Harris and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), have so far failed to show they can generate such energy. (Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick launched his campaign last week.) Harris initially put much of her focus on South Carolina, but after meager results, she has shifted her emphasis to Iowa. Booker has made a significant investment in the Palmetto State, visiting often and hiring respected operatives but has yet to catch on there.

AD

Sanders hopes to do better. The youthful state legislators supporting him hold themselves up as a breakthrough generation, and they say the Vermont senator amounts to the same thing on a national level.

Simmons said her conversations with Biden supporters do not end after she tries to divorce his accomplishments from Obama’s. She goes on to tell them that Sanders may be an unconventional politician, but that is a good thing.

She is a single mother of five and one of the youngest members of the legislature. She is an African American representative in a state that just four years ago flew a Confederate battle flag on state capitol grounds.

“I bring a whole new perspective to the statehouse,” Simmons said. “I am younger. I have the most kids of anybody in the legislature. I’m still working a full-time job by myself, which not a lot of [legislators] do.”

Regarding Sanders, she asked, “What if you can bring fresh eyes to the situation?”"

But it’s hard to see his winning a lot of Democratic primaries, and not just because he turned himself into a temporary Republican to get to City Hall. From the moment word went out that he was pondering a campaign for president, he sharpened the class and ideological divisions within the Democratic electorate.

Somewhere on the seventh tee, the phony populist Trump is laughing. One side of the Democratic Party is denouncing its foes as class enemies and apologists of the rich. The other argues that champions of the left will destroy the American economy. Is this how Democrats want to spend the next few months?

Bloomberg might usefully notice that the two candidates most elated by the prospect of his candidacy are Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). A multi-multi-billionaire is the foil Warren and Sanders dream about.

AD

Warren’s supporters are understandably angry over how the party’s Wall Street wing has recently sharpened its knives against her, especially on her wealth tax.

In fact, the wealth tax underscores how much money is concentrated at the very top of our economy. Warren is asking why the wealth of so many middle-class Americans is already taxed (homes are their biggest nest egg, and they pay real estate taxes every year), while the holdings of the very rich often never face a levy. Perhaps her wealth tax will need to be reconfigured in the form of higher taxes on the capital gains, estates and transactions of the most fortunate Americans. Nonetheless, she has already transformed our thinking about how the government should raise money.

Medicare-for-all is similarly helpful, putting fundamental change on the agenda and making clear how moderate Obamacare is by comparison. But as my Post colleagues Ruth Marcus and Catherine Rampell pointed out last week, Warren’s heroic efforts to explain how it would work highlighted its vulnerability to both substantive and political attacks.

Democrats have the high ground on health care now. In Kentucky’s race for governor, Democrat Andy Beshear demonstrated that even Trump voters want to save and build on the Affordable Care Act. Why throw away this advantage? All Democrats should support universal coverage, but we can get there, as other countries have, through mixed public-private systems. Arguments over Medicare-for-all would make sense after we finish the initial work of covering everyone.

When it comes to former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Bloomberg’s actions can be seen as a vote of no confidence. It’s true that Biden, shall we say, hasn’t lived up to the hopes of his supporters. Buttigieg has yet to solve his problems with the African American community.

But Bloomberg’s support for stop-and-frisk policing will hardly make him more popular than Buttigieg among black voters. And polls suggest that in South Carolina and Nevada — the states that vote after Iowa and New Hampshire, where Biden is in trouble — the former vice president is hanging on. In the meantime, Buttigieg is surging in Iowa. Bloomberg could thus be a spoiler for the candidates he is closest to ideologically — without winning himself.

But here’s the larger issue: Democrats need a leader who can remind progressives and moderates that they have far more in common than their current strife would suggest. These competing camps agree on the urgency of ousting Trump, but also on getting health insurance to everyone, moving forcefully on climate change, acting humanely on immigration, defending civil and voting rights, and pushing back against growing inequality.

The person who rises to the task of pulling these sides together will deserve the nomination. Will one of these candidates even audition for the part?

Tom Steyer files to be placed on the New Hampshire primary ballot at the statehouse in Concord, N.H., on Tuesday. (Elise Amendola/AP)

It was the first question Tom Steyer got after officially filing as a candidate in New Hampshire’s presidential primary. It was the question he always got: How was a billionaire, mostly bankrolling his own campaign, going to inspire Democrats to vote for him?

“I think that what every Democratic voter is looking for is for someone to tell the truth,” Steyer said. “I’ve spent 10 years thinking about what the truth is.”

It was a cryptic answer, but it made sense for Steyer. Like Mike Bloomberg, if he decides to run, Steyer is able to fund a large-scale presidential campaign without worrying about where the money will come from. Both men have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on down-ballot candidates and causes, winning them allies from the gun control movement to the House Democratic conference. While Bloomberg is perhaps 50 times wealthier than Steyer, both of them have enough money to say and do whatever they want and invite frustrated, pragmatic Democrats to come along.

But Steyer’s campaign so far has demonstrated the limits of hacking the Democratic Party and its primary. Bloomberg adeptly did that to New York’s desperate Republican Party two decades ago, with his quick transition from business to politics. Steyer has spent at least $47 million — that number does not include the past six weeks of hire and TV buys — for single-digit polls, small crowds of voters and minor scandals in two early-voting states. When Steyer spoke at this month’s Liberty and Justice Celebration in Des Moines, sandwiched between Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the lack of a cheering section was noticeable.

“I haven’t seen them at events,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chairman in Polk County, Iowa, of Steyer’s five-month campaign there. “I haven’t seen them as much at the phone banking. They’ve been a lot less visible.”

If Bloomberg does run for president — he was filing in person for the Arkansas ballot Tuesday but hasn't officially announced a bid — it will be with a different focus from Steyer, who has turned his lack of elected experience into familiar “Washington is broken” messaging. Unlike Bloomberg, who has won office as only a Republican and given to multiple Republican campaigns, Steyer entered the race with Democratic bona fides and a brand built by countless “Need to Impeach” TV ads.

It got him into the conversation, at some cost. Steyer’s campaign, according to people who had been offered jobs in early states, has floated higher salaries and better benefits than anything else in the field. A national communications role was pegged at $150,000, about 25 percent higher than comparable positions with other Democrats. Organizing roles in the Iowa campaign paid $4,500 to $5,000 per month and came with “wellness benefits,” such as gym membership and student debt forgiveness.

“The workplace policies that we have put in place are meant to attract top talent and catch up with campaigns that have already hired hundreds of staff,” said Steyer spokesman Ben Gerdes. “We pay our staff a living wage and want to ensure that all people can afford to work on this campaign.”

With less than three months to go before the caucuses, this has been enough to organize an Iowa campaign while running behind the campaigns that built more organically. Ten days ago, as former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke's campaign shuttered, some top staff were approached about roles with Steyer and a chance to leave a sunken ship for a well-stocked one. While the campaign has “added staff from congressman O'Rourke's campaign in Iowa,” according to Gerdes, top staffers rebuffed them, with some returning to consulting work and some going on vacation. The appeal of a Texan driving himself from town hall to town hall did not transfer to a wealthy candidate promising to spend big and then take money out of politics.

There were some challenges money couldn't fix and some it could create. The biggest blows to Steyer's campaign came this month: first, when his deputy South Carolina director Dwayne Sims stole data belonging to Kamala D. Harris's campaign, then when his Iowa adviser Pat Murphy offered campaign donations to legislators if they would endorse Steyer. The campaign forced out both Sims and Murphy.

“He resigned,” Steyer said Tuesday, when asked whether Murphy's scandal might make it harder for legislators to support Steyer. “Nothing bad happened. I feel like that's what an organization does. I've been running organizations now for 34 years, and I feel that you have to have standards and live up to those standards.”

Any campaign starting now would have even fewer available staffers than Steyer did when he launched his campaign this summer. Bloomberg, who like Steyer had flirted with a presidential bid, ruled it out and reconsidered, had a strong initial idea of who would staff his campaign in early states. Nine months later, political talent has scattered.

“The best-case scenario is that they find the old Beto people, which would be tough,"" said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democratic strategist who is not aligned with any campaign. ""Five days out, you don’t want to be telling people how to pronounce 'Madrid' or 'Nevada.'"" (It’s MAY-drid and Nuh-VAY-duh, in Iowa.)

Bloomberg’s allies suggest that they wouldn't have to worry about that — not in Iowa. To the immediate fury of the early-state Democratic chairs, Bloomberg’s team suggested he could skip organizing in February and focus on Super Tuesday and the states voting afterward. Instead of lobbying for every vote in Iowa, the mayor could introduce himself to the voters of California, Minnesota, Texas and so on with an ad blitz, the sort of candidate interaction that they’re used to. And doing so did not require a grass-roots campaign.

“I'm going to finance the campaign, if there is one, with my own money so I don't owe anybody anything,” Bloomberg told reporters after filing in Arkansas. “Other people ask for donations, in return for which they've got to give favors. But it costs a lot of money, whether you're doing it with your own money or somebody else's money, to get a message out.”

That’s the angle Steyer has been using for months, to mixed results. In Concord, he talked up how successful NextGen, his young voter outreach campaign, had been in New Hampshire; Bloomberg had been tremendously successful in funding organizations such as Moms Demand Action and ads for Democrats in 2018. Asked on Tuesday how much more money he might spend, Steyer had another cryptic answer.

“Campaigns are wild animals,” he said. “You’re not sure where they’re going to twist and where they’re going to turn.”

On Sept. 8, former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford began his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, telling Fox News's Chris Wallace that “we need to have a conversation about what it means to be a Republican.” On Tuesday, that conversation came to an end, as Sanford, arriving at New Hampshire's state house, announced that he would not even bother filing for the February primary.

“All of the oxygen is leaving the room, in terms of meaningful debate, on what comes next in our country on a whole host of issues,” Sanford said. “You cannot have a meaningful debate on what we do about the debt and deficit.”

It was a surprise — not because Sanford was in a winning position but because he had seemed ready for a quixotic Republican rescue mission. Just 59 years old, campaigning on a tight budget, Sanford spent nearly as much time talking to Republican operatives about a run as he spent running as an actual primary candidate.

But nobody seemed to pay attention. Last month, Sanford participated in a friendly debate with the two other Republicans challenging Trump, former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld. He was largely left out of the coverage, with his rivals delivering more memorable zingers about the president. He intended to drive the conversation toward his issues with a national tour of events about the debt. Few people showed up. A speech outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall drew no voters and just one reporter, to whom Sanford seemed ready to concede.

“If there’s an appetite in terms of people’s concerns on the financial realities of our country and the way in which we are at a tipping point, then there’s going to be some level of measure and movement with regard to the campaign,” Sanford told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “And if there’s not, there won’t be. And it will be short-lived.”

The indignities came one after the other, often from Sanford's own party. South Carolina Republicans canceled their primary, which drew a lawsuit from anti-Trump Republicans on behalf of Sanford, Weld and Walsh. Minnesota Republicans submitted their primary ballot, months ahead of the deadline, with just one presidential candidate: Trump.

“I don't think we want to get our cues on electoral participation from North Korea,” Sanford said in Concord.

Nothing, least of all the campaigning, could turn the conversation to the national debt. It hit $23 trillion while Sanford was a candidate, with government spending far outpacing revenue, in part because of a tax cut that Sanford supported. In Concord, Sanford held up a mock U.S. Treasury check for $1 trillion, made out to generations of “future years.” Current spending levels are leaving the country in an “unsettling spot” financially, he said, calling sweeping social programs from Democratic candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts akin to “financial malpractice.”

Until Sanford quit the race, New Hampshire's libertarian-leaning Republicans looked like a potential constituency for him. Shortly after the Concord announcement, a town councilor from the nearby town of Merrimack, Bill Boyd, approached Sanford to thank him for addressing the issue and lament that his campaign hadn't caught on.

Sanford walked on, into the State House Visitors Center, where he inspected a wall of campaign bumper stickers stretching back into the decades. A Sanford aide added one of his mock “trillion-dollar bills” to the collection. Nearby was a life-size cardboard cutout of Trump, flashing a grin and a thumbs-up.

The director of the visitor center, Virginia Drew, let out a sigh when Sanford told her he was withdrawing.

“It starts here,” she said, referring to New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, “and it ends here.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Tom Steyer, “Democracy Agenda.” This kitchen-sink spot, running in national markets, sums up Steyer's total agenda: citizen referendums and term limits to unclog the pipes of government. ""I don't think we can fix our democracy from the inside,"" Steyer says. ""I don't think Washington politicians or big corporations will let that happen.""

Bernie Sanders, “Belongs to Us.” The senator from Vermont's latest Iowa spot is interesting for whom it pegs as villains (Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, makes an appearance) and how it phrases his priorities: to “expand Social Security and guarantee health care for all.” Sanders, who wrote the Senate Medicare-for-all legislation and has made it the focus of campaign events, has used the “Medicare-for-all” term in his paid media less than Andrew Yang, who does not support the legislation in full. A previous Sanders ad in Iowa referred to “guaranteed health care for all.”

Joe Biden, “Moment.” The latest of Biden's Iowa spots focuses on foreign policy, for the first time pitching his “strong, steady, stable leadership” as an antidote to President Trump. It touches on a common topic with Democratic voters: a worry about how long it could take to restore stability after the Trump years. But it does not focus on any particular Trump foreign policy failure.

POLL WATCH

Iowa caucuses (Monmouth, 451 Iowa Democrats)

Pete Buttigieg — 22% ( 14)

Joe Biden — 19% (-7)

Elizabeth Warren — 18% (-2)

Bernie Sanders — 13% ( 5)

Amy Klobuchar — 5% ( 2)

Kamala D. Harris — 3% (-9)

Tom Steyer — 3% (-)

Andrew Yang — 3% ( 2)

Cory Booker — 2% ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 2% ( 1)

Steve Bullock — 1% (-)

Julián Castro — 1% ( 1)

The first poll to show Buttigieg in the lead is the umpteenth poll to find, essentially, an Iowa deadlock: Sanders doing a bit better as voters view him more favorably, but Buttigieg, Biden and Warren are in a close fight for the lead. Buttigieg's own favorable rating is unchanged since August, but after a month-long dogpile by other candidates, Warren has experienced her first drop in favorables; more than 20 percent of Iowa Democrats view her unfavorably, for the first time. But she remains better liked, and a more popular second-choice candidate, than Biden, who has dropped in this poll all year and for the first time does not lead it.

The rest of the results demonstrate just how much Iowa Democrats have begun to focus on a few top choices. The number of Iowa Democrats who have “no opinion” of Harris, Booker and Steyer has increased, as they've fallen out of the conversation. Weeks of ad buys have done nothing to move Michael F. Bennet's numbers. By a 31-point margin, Iowa Democrats view Michael Bloomberg unfavorably, with Monmouth finding next to no interest for his campaign. And this poll probably freezes the debate stage at 10, with Castro and Bullock running out of time to qualify for November's event in Atlanta.

Would you consider voting for Michael Bloomberg? (Quinnipiac, 1,134 New Hampshire likely voters)

Definitely not — 54%

Consider it — 37%

Definitely would — 2%

As of Tuesday, it's unclear whether Bloomberg will really run for president or not; it's unclear whether he will file in the first primary state, where the deadline to make the ballot is Friday. But the first poll taken since he began flirting with a run again is ominous, with firm support for a Bloomberg candidacy starting at 2 percent. A majority or plurality of voters, in every demographic and political affiliation, rule out a vote for Bloomberg. The only exceptions are “somewhat liberal” voters, 50 percent of whom would definitely support the former mayor or consider it. Of the current Democratic candidates, Joe Biden loses the most support to a hypothetical Bloomberg run, but it's negligible. The fundamental problem is the one seen in the same poll's horse race numbers, which find Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent: The independents who are inclined to cross over into the Democratic primary are more anti-politics-as-usual than pro-centrism.

Louisiana governor (Mason-Dixon, 625 registered voters)

John Bel Edwards (D) — 48%

Eddie Rispone (R) — 46%

The last election of 2019 is happening in four days, with one more presidential rally coming before the polls close. Rispone, who secured a runoff spot by dominating the airwaves with ads, has not grabbed control of the runoff; Edwards slashed at him in their single televised debate, and African American turnout has been up relative to last month's primary. But this poll, probably the only one we'll get before Saturday, lines up with Democrats' internal polling: a single-digit lead for Edwards, who is popular but running up against an increasingly Republican electorate.

IN THE STATES

California. Former Republican congressman Steve Knight is running again in the 25th Congressional District, which he lost by nine points to Katie Hill. The one-time Democratic phenom resigned after accusations of inappropriate relationship with staff and the release of “revenge porn” photographs; the election to replace her hasn't been set. But Knight is unlikely to clear the field, joining GOP recruit Mike Garcia (who raised $481,013 before Hill's resignation) and local Republican city councilor Angela Underwood Jacobs, who began running before the seat opened up again. State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who represents much of the Los Angeles-area seat, has dominated the Democratic field in endorsements so far.

Kentucky. The Democratic primary for next year's Senate race got another Democrat: state legislator Charles Booker. He's the first Democrat to enter the race since Amy McGrath, a female veteran and 2018 congressional candidate well-liked by national party leaders, raised $10.7 million in her first quarter, far outpacing any other Senate candidate in the country. But where McGrath has been criticized for taking moderate stances (such as a bungled answer on whether she'd have voted for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh), Booker is pitching himself as a liberal and supporter of the Green New Deal.

Mississippi. Mike Espy officially entered the state's 2020 Senate race, one year after narrowly losing a special election for the seat to Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith — and one week after Democrats lost the state's race for governor, which had looked winnable this summer for Attorney General Jim Hood.

“We tried to help Jim Hood,” Espy said in an interview. “We did as much as Jim Hood asked me to do. But Jim Hood would be the first to tell you that there wasn't a lot of energy around that race, and there wasn't enough done to get out the black vote. Coming up in 2020, I don't think that's going to be an issue.”

Espy, who had largely retired from politics before his 2018 run, said he was hurt by lower turnout and by the short time frame he had for campaigning.

“We had enough money, but not enough time to deploy the money,” Espy said. “I had to stand up and campaign alone, because the Mississippi Democratic Party wasn't strong like it should have been. But the enthusiasm was palpable in 2018, and this time we need it to be off the charts.”

Espy said that pushing black turnout slightly higher and holding onto gains with white voters would get his candidacy to 50 percent of the vote; he'd won 46.4 percent in his bid against Hyde-Smith. And he distanced himself from his party's more left-wing voices.

“I'm not for Medicare-for-all,” he said. “I believe that if you have your own health insurance, you ought to be able to keep it. I don't want a single-payer system. I'm not for open borders on immigration. I'm an independent, moderate Democrat, and I've always been that way.”

2020

What does a multimillionaire coal magnate do after a self-funded Senate bid falls through? He runs for president. Don Blankenship, whose 2018 candidacy in West Virginia startled Republicans into spending money against him, is now seeking the conservative Constitution Party's presidential nomination.

“Don will be attempting to be the first person ever to become an occupant of the White House after having been in the 'big house,' "" his campaign announced. (Blankenship served a year in prison after a 2015 misdemeanor conviction over the violation of federal mine-safety standards.) ""In response to the Mitch McConnell-led smear campaign Don has an active defamation lawsuit against the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), numerous media outlets and Donald Trump, Jr."" The Post is among the media defendants Blankenship has sued.

The Constitution Party, which grew out of the old U.S. Taxpayers Party, has never become a real player in presidential politics. In 2008, the party's Montana affiliate gave its ballot line to Ron Paul; it has otherwise nominated conservative activists with small or nonexistent national profiles. A perennial problem has been how to make the case against the Republican Party without enabling a Democratic victory, something Blankenship has been puzzling over.

“I see a country that does not have a plan to get better or to make the country be great again,” Blankenship told The Post. “I am still supportive of the president’s policies, and generally I am supporting the president.”

Blankenship spent more than $2 million of his own money on the 2018 Senate run, and his net worth is estimated in the tens of millions, less than billionaire Tom Steyer has spent on his Democratic primary campaign.

Tulsi Gabbard. Through an unnamed legal counsel, Gabbard demanded that Hillary Clinton apologize for the remarks she made Oct. 17, in which she claimed the Hawaiian was being “groomed” for a third-party candidacy. Clinton's quote referred to Republicans sounding out Gabbard for a run, but her spokesman did not deny that she was talking about Russians; Gabbard and allies have said the 2016 Democratic nominee was smearing her as a traitor.

Gabbard's demands now include that Clinton hold a news conference (which would be her first in three years) and issue this statement: “On October 17, 2019, I made certain statements about Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Among other things, I accused her of being a Russian asset and that Russia was grooming her to be a third-party presidential candidate. I was wrong. I never should have made these remarks, and I apologize. I did not have any basis for making the statements. I acknowledge my grave mistake and error in judgment in this matter. I support and admire the work that Congresswoman Gabbard has done and will continue to do in serving our country.”

Bernie Sanders. He secured the endorsement of National Nurses United, a union that had provided millions of dollars in support for his 2016 campaign. Only three candidates submitted themselves for sit-down interviews with the union: Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. ""We were fortunate to have candidates to choose from this time,"" said Jean Ross, the union's co-president. ""In 2016, there was one candidate who backs our issues. This was more difficult.""

Joe Biden. He published a list of 133 endorsements from diplomats and military leaders, part of a post-Veterans Day campaign push on his experience and credibility as a commander in chief.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

The latest Democratic argument started with a dodge. Over the weekend, at a lightly attended environmental justice forum in South Carolina, Democracy Now host Amy Goodman asked Elizabeth Warren whether the order of the primaries was unfairly biased against nonwhite voters.

“Are you actually going to ask me to sit here and criticize Iowa and New Hampshire?” Warren asked.

“They’re two of the whitest states in the country,” Goodman explained, “and then we move to South Carolina with a very significant population of people of color, and it means the candidates spend so much of their time catering to those first two states. Overall, do you think that should change?”

Warren didn't bite. “Look, I’m just a player in the game on this one,” she said. “And I am delighted to be in South Carolina.”

Other candidates had given similar answers to the question, which is both direct and full of risks. The timing of Goodman's question added some drama; some who watched it, unaware that it was the final question at a largely policy-focused forum, speculated that Warren had lost her cool and cut the interview short. Since then, most Democrats have given the same answer as Warren, while Julián Castro has come out against the standard (since 2008) primary order.

“I actually do believe that we need to change the order of the states because I don’t believe that we’re the same country we were in 1972 — that is when Iowa first held its caucus first,” Castro said. “Demographically, it’s not reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party, and I believe that other states should have their chance. … We can't say to black women, 'Oh thank you, you are the ones empowering our victories,' and then turn around and start our nominating contests in two states that have barely any black people in them.”

Castro said this in Iowa, shortly after downsizing his campaign in New Hampshire and South Carolina. He has repeatedly criticized the DNC's debate rules, which are likely to boot him from the stage this month, because they depend on polling from early states, and Nevada — the only February state with a significant Latino population — has hardly been polled at all. (Castro came in at 1 percent in the most recent state poll, conducted for the Nevada Independent.)

Still, he was the only candidate to dig in on a perennial, awkward topic, one that had actually stayed beneath the surface for much of this year. The first two states, which winnow down the primary field and get the vast majority of candidate attention, are overwhelmingly white. The party is not. While issues that primarily affect Latino, black and Asian American issues have been debated throughout the campaign, they're not determinative in Iowa or New Hampshire.

Why hadn't this debate broken out before? Part of the reason was the 2016 election, which swept Democrats out of power thanks to heavy losses in the Midwest. Iowa, overnight, transformed from yet another mostly white state, to a state with a story to tell: Nearly one-third of its 99 counties had voted for Barack Obama, then for Donald Trump. The Democratic panic about “electability” was in large part a panic about white voters without college degrees, and Iowa was suddenly a place to prove a candidate's appeal to those voters.

Another reason: the general Democratic awareness that no candidate could win with white primary voters alone. Joe Biden had been the most blunt about it, with his campaign emphasizing the candidate's diverse support by way of explaining how he could absorb losses in the first two primaries. The primary's two black candidates, Kamala D. Harris and Cory Booker, worked to evoke memories of 2008: A win in Iowa, proving a black candidate's appeal to white voters, could move black voters' minds.

Why has the debate broken out now? A big reason is Pete Buttigieg, who, unlike the other high-polling white candidates, has negligible support so far with nonwhite voters. Castro, who in the past few weeks has been especially scabrous about the 37-year-old Hoosier's rise, was making a point about how dazzled Iowans might be on track to elevate a candidate whom nonwhite voters view skeptically, if they think of him at all.

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: President Trump called John Bolton at home to complain after he saw a CNN report last December that said the U.S. Navy was preparing to sail a warship into the Black Sea as a show of strength following Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian vessels and sailors, a State Department official testified. The maneuvers were canceled after the then-national security adviser conveyed these concerns.

That’s one of the eyebrow-raising, Russia-related revelations in the three transcripts released on Monday night by House impeachment investigators, as they prepare for the start of televised hearings tomorrow. The disclosure hints at Trump playing a more hands-on role in Ukraine policy than his defenders want to acknowledge as they search for possible fall guys to pin the blame on.

Trump talks a big game about how important it is to be strong on the world stage, and he’s declared that “nobody has been tougher on Russia” than he has been, but his recurring impulse to disregard Vladimir Putin’s provocations has been anything but. It’s put him at odds with many of the more hawkish aides he installed in the national security firmament.

“We met with Ambassador Bolton and discussed this, and he made it clear that the president had called him to complain about that news report. And that may have just been that he was surprised,” said Christopher Anderson, a senior Ukraine specialist at the State Department. “I can't speculate as to why, but that operation was canceled.”

Anderson recalled hearing Bolton joke about how Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, seemed to pop up every time Ukraine was mentioned, according to the 118-page transcript of his Oct. 30 deposition. He also said that Gordon Sondland, the Trump megadonor who got appointed as ambassador to the European Union, played an outsized role, even though Ukraine is not a member of the E.U.

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has orchestrated a separatist war in the eastern part of Ukraine that has left at least 13,000 people dead. In November 2018, Russia escalated the conflict again by capturing three Ukrainian-flagged military vessels and detaining 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait as they headed to a Ukrainian port in the Sea of Azov.

“While my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,” Anderson testified.

Instead, it was left to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to condemn the move. Later, Trump would cite the Russian seizure of the vessels when he canceled a scheduled meeting with Putin during the G-20 in Argentina. But Anderson said that Ukrainian officials noticed Trump’s silence, especially as other Western leaders spoke out, and they asked their counterparts in the American government why the White House never expressed support.

Ironically, Anderson explained, the CNN story that prompted the president’s complaint to Bolton was overblown. (He said during the hearing that he thought it came out in early January, but the piece was published in December.)

“The news report seemed to be, in my understanding, exaggerating the situation, because all the Navy had done was file a standard notification under the Montreux Convention that they were planning to transit into the Black Sea,” Anderson said.

The Montreux Convention is a 1936 treaty that requires any country without coastline on the Black Sea to notify Turkey at least 15 days before transiting a military vessel through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, which connect the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.

Anderson, a career foreign service officer, added that U.S. officials forged ahead with a subsequent operation in February to show support for Ukraine by deploying an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer to Odessa on the fifth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Crimea.

-- Other witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have also linked the Russia and Ukraine sagas. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified that Trump appeared to sour on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky between their calls on April 21 and July 25 partly because of conversations he had with Putin, the Russian president, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

-- A belief that Ukraine is part of Russia’s sphere of influence has been cited by other inside sources as a possible explanation for Trump’s treatment of Kyiv. During a meeting with his own aides in the fall of 2017, before a sit-down with Ukraine’s previous president, former aides have told us that Trump grumbled that Ukraine is not a “real country” and that it had always been a part of Russia.

-- In another transcript released Monday night, State Department Ukraine specialist Catherine Croft revealed that Mick Mulvaney – before he became acting White House chief of staff – placed a peculiar hold on the sale of Javelin antitank missiles to Ukraine. It was “highly unusual,” she explained, because he was running the Office of Management and Budget at the time. She said the policy concern he expressed related to how the Russians would react, which was outside of his primary portfolio, and came after the secretaries of defense and state had signed off. Ultimately, Croft said, then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster had her brief Mulvaney on the value of the weapons and he dropped his hold after “a week or two.”

“In a briefing with Mr. Mulvaney, the question centered around the Russian reaction,” Croft testified. “That Russia would react negatively to the provision of Javelins to Ukraine.”

-- Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense, said during her deposition that it, similarly, seemed peculiar when OMB officials froze aid to Ukraine this summer. The Pentagon had greenlighted the money, and there was consensus that the money was essential across the national security apparatus, when the budget office blocked the money from being transferred, reportedly at Trump’s apparent behest.

-- The latest tranche of testimony further undercuts the Trump team’s talking point that there couldn’t have been a quid pro quo because Ukrainian leaders didn’t find out that nearly $400 million in congressional approved security assistance had been frozen until Politico reported on it in late August. Croft said the Ukrainians “found out very early on” after the OMB froze the funds at Trump’s behest on July 18.

Cooper told investigators that Kurt Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine and Croft’s boss at the time, led her to make a “very strong inference” that the Ukrainians knew weeks before the freeze became public. The deputy assistant secretary of defense testified that Ukrainian leaders would never have entertained Volker’s request for a public statement about launching investigations unless they were doing so in exchange for “something valuable.” Furthermore, Cooper noted that acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor was also sounding “alarm bells … that there were Ukrainians who knew” about the freeze before it became publicly known, though she didn’t provide specific dates.

Cooper testified that her team at the Pentagon was especially concerned the funds were being held up by the White House this summer because it weakened Ukraine’s hand in negotiations with Russia. “They are trying to negotiate a peace with Russia, and if they are seen as weak, and if they are seen to lack the backing of the United States for their armed forces, it makes it much more difficult for them to negotiate a peace on terms that are good for Ukraine,” she said.

-- Two of Trump’s other explanations also don’t hold up under scrutiny. “The president, in his defense, asserts that he was concerned about corruption writ large in Ukraine, not in securing some 2020 election advantage. In addition, he says he was angered that European allies were not doing enough financially to help the beleaguered country, leaving the United States to carry the can,” Karen DeYoung and Ellen Nakashima report. But, on the July 25 call, “Trump did not mention any wider concern about overall corruption related to U.S. assistance, the subject that he and senior administration officials now insist was the basis for the sudden holdup after years of steady security aid.” Also: “European nations have far outpaced the United States in Ukraine, spending $18.3 billion since Russia annexed Crimea … By contrast, combined military and nonmilitary assistance from the United States has totaled about $4 billion over the same period…”

-- Connecting the dots: Career employees have emerged as crucial witnesses more than in any political scandal in modern history. “All but one of the 11 career Foreign Service staff, military officers and Pentagon officials who first testified in closed-door depositions in the Capitol basement are still in government,"" Lisa Rein reports. ""For now, they’ve faced no efforts to punish them for telling House investigators that normal diplomacy was bypassed by a rogue foreign policy to benefit Trump politically, their lawyers say. However, former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who is scheduled to testify publicly on Friday, is close to retirement and told House investigators that she felt ‘threatened’ by the president — and worried about her pension and her employment.”

MORE ON MULVANEY:

-- The White House’s bifurcated and disjointed response to the impeachment inquiry has been fueled by a battle between Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Erica Werner, Josh Dawsey, Carol D. Leonnig and Rachael Bade report: “Mulvaney has urged aides not to comply with the inquiry and blocked any cooperation with congressional Democrats. Top political aides at the Office of Management and Budget, which Mulvaney once led, have fallen in line with his defiant stance ... Mulvaney’s office blames [Cipollone] for not doing more to stop other government officials from participating in the impeachment inquiry, as a number of State Department officials, diplomats and an aide to Vice President Pence have given sworn testimony to Congress.

""Cipollone, meanwhile, has fumed that Mulvaney only made matters worse with his Oct. 17 news conference, when he publicly acknowledged a quid pro quo, essentially confirming Democrats’ accusations in front of television cameras and reporters. Cipollone did not want Mulvaney to hold the news conference, a message that was passed along to the acting chief of staff’s office, according to two senior Trump advisers ... A Mulvaney aide said a team of White House lawyers prepared him for the news conference and never said he should not do it.

“Neither Mulvaney nor Cipollone has broad experience navigating a White House through such a tumultuous period. But their actions have contributed to the White House’s increasingly tenuous response to the impeachment inquiry ... Despite the high stakes, the White House moved slowly to hire a staff specifically dedicated to working on the impeachment issue, a concern that was expressed to the White House by multiple GOP senators … Another dispute between the Mulvaney and Cipollone camps emerged over the potential hiring of former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) ... Mulvaney advocated for hiring his former House colleague and longtime friend ... But Cipollone was opposed. ... Some Hill Republicans were not pleased and have accused Cipollone of being territorial behind the scenes. They wanted Gowdy ... to lead the cross-examination for Trump in the Senate — a role Cipollone is said to want for himself. ...

""Trump has complained about his legal team to White House officials and advisers in recent weeks, saying they need to be more aggressive and defend him more. ... At the same time, Trump has been complaining about Mulvaney, blaming him for his political troubles, and has toyed with the idea of replacing him ... Some administration officials complain that Cipollone has not kept Mulvaney and other White House offices in the loop on key decisions. Cipollone’s office released the transcript of the president’s July 25 call with his Ukrainian counterpart — a move Mulvaney opposed ... Neither the acting chief of staff nor some members of the White House press office knew ahead of time that was going to happen. ...

""GOP senators have been worried that the White House was moving too slowly to hire staffers specifically dedicated to working on the impeachment issue as the inquiry moves into its public phase. Multiple senators made this concern known to the White House, the aide said. Their concerns were finally alleviated last week with news that Pam Bondi, a former attorney general of Florida, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman, would join the administration to work on impeachment-related messaging and other issues.""

-- Last night, Mulvaney withdrew a last-minute effort to join a lawsuit filed by Bolton's former top deputy, Charles Kupperman. Spencer Hsu reports: ""Mulvaney said he will file his own lawsuit focused on the same question: Must senior Trump administration officials testify in Congress’s impeachment inquiry? Kupperman, in a filing earlier Monday, opposed Mulvaney’s request to join the case ... Kupperman attorney Charles J. Cooper, who also represents Bolton, had suggested that the same judge weigh Mulvaney’s claims 'in tandem' as a separate, related case. The two former Trump national security aides are said by people close to them to consider Mulvaney a key participant in President Trump’s alleged effort to pressure the Ukrainian government ... Mulvaney’s attempt to join the lawsuit flabbergasted Bolton and Kupperman ... with Bolton aides having testified that he derisively referred to the Ukrainian proposal as 'a drug deal,' and White House officials saying Bolton and Mulvaney were barely on speaking terms when Bolton left his post in September.""

THE LATEST ON THE INQUIRY:

-- Congressional Republicans are sticking with Trump despite the mounting evidence showing that he leveraged foreign policy for political favors, making it more likely that no House Republican will vote for his impeachment. Rachael Bade reports: “Democrats had hoped to peel off Republican support from a key bloc — retiring lawmakers who need not worry about internal blowback or primary challenges. Yet many are refusing to break with Trump. Rep. Peter T. King of New York made a point of stating his intention to vote against impeaching Trump in his retirement announcement Monday, a troubling sign for Democrats. … GOP cohesion will test Democrats’ impeachment strategy as they moved their inquiry into the public sphere Wednesday. Democrats recognize that the onus is on them to make the case to independent voters who don’t have time to sift through thousands of pages of transcripts alleging presidential misconduct.” (Clip and save for tomorrow: The Fact Checker's guide to impeachment hearing spin.)

-- Giuliani is considering launching his own impeachment podcast. From CNN: “Giuliani was overheard discussing the plans with an unidentified woman while at a crowded New York City restaurant, Sant Ambroeus, over lunch on Saturday. The conversation, which lasted more than an hour, touched on details including dates for recording and releasing the podcast, settling on a logo, and the process of uploading the podcast to iTunes and other podcast distributors. Two people who overheard Giuliani's discussion reached out to CNN and provided a recording they decided to make of the conversation. … Giuliani's intention seems to be to have four episodes finished before the start of the Senate trial.”

-- Condoleezza Rice called the reports of Giulaini's efforts in Ukraine ""deeply troubling."" “What I see right now troubles me. I see a state of conflict between the foreign policy professionals and someone who says he’s acting on behalf of the president but, frankly, I don’t know if that is the case,” the former secretary of state said at a conference in Abu Dhabi. “It is troubling. It is deeply troubling.” (Reuters)

-- Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson denies that he sought to undermine or work against Trump, as former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley claims in her new book. Anne Gearan reports: “‘During my service to our country as the Secretary of State, at no time did I, nor to my direct knowledge did anyone else serving along with me, take any actions to undermine the President,’ Tillerson said in a statement to The Washington Post. ‘My conversations with the President in the privacy of the Oval Office were always candid, frank, and my recommendations straightforward. Once the President made a decision, we at the State Department undertook our best efforts to implement that decision,’ Tillerson said. ‘Ambassador Haley was rarely a participant in my many meetings and is not in a position to know what I may or may not have said to the President. I continue to be proud of my service as our country’s 69th Secretary of State.’”

-- A federal judge appointed by Trump ruled that the president can’t sue New York state officials in a D.C. court to stop the release of his tax returns to Congress. From CNN: “Effectively, the ruling is a loss for Trump but a less significant one then the blows other courts have dealt him in cases involving Democrats' pursuits of his financial records. Courts have sided with the House multiple times in cases where its committees have subpoenaed Trump's financial records. Trump is still appealing those rulings, keeping the House subpoenas on hold.”

-- Trump falsely claimed that he signed the Whistleblower Protection Act. In a tweet, Trump claimed that he signed a law that Congress passed 30 years ago. He was responding to a message sent by the White House Twitter account that correctly stated that Trump signed a separate measure – the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which, among other things, aims to protect whistleblowers within the Department of Veteran Affairs. Trump appears to have misread the tweet. (Felicia Sonmez, John Wagner, Elise Viebeck and Brittany Shammas)

-- Former president Jimmy Carter was hospitalized for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The pressure was triggered by bleeding in the brain caused by recent falls, and the procedure is scheduled for Tuesday morning ... He was admitted to Emory University Hospital on Monday evening and was resting comfortably with his wife, Rosalynn Carter, the [Carter Center] said. Last month, Carter was hospitalized with a minor pelvic fracture after falling in his Georgia home. The 95-year-old fell on Oct. 6, just days after his birthday, and required stitches above his left brow.""

AMERICA CONTINUES TO BECOME A CORPORATOCRACY:

-- California Gov. Gavin Newsom accuses Pacific Gas & Electric of “corporate greed,"" but the company's largesse has helped finance his and his wife’s careers. Douglas MacMillan and Neena Satija report: “Over the past two decades, Newsom (D) and his wife have accepted more than $700,000 from the [PG&E], its foundation and its employees as the utility has supported his political campaigns, his ballot initiatives, his inauguration festivities and his wife’s foundation, including her film projects, according to records reviewed by The Washington Post. The contributions illustrate Newsom’s ties to the company responsible for wildfires that have killed at least 85 people and caused billions of dollars in damage over the past three years. The governor has slammed PG&E for paying bonuses to executives and cash dividends to its investors instead of spending more on infrastructure upgrades that could have prevented the fires. … Between 2011 and 2018, the utility’s philanthropic arm gave $358,000 to the Representation Project, a nonprofit group founded by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the governor’s wife. The PG&E Corporation Foundation also gave $10,000 to the PlumpJack Foundation, a charity led by his sister, Hilary Newsom, according to information provided by PG&E. ...

“PG&E, an investor-owned utility whose largest shareholders include hedge funds Knighthead Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management, filed for bankruptcy in January, declaring itself unable to pay the billions of dollars in mounting liabilities from repeated seasons of wildfires. Its market value is about $3.4 billion, after losing more than $30 billion in equity value over the past two years. When a federal judge asked PG&E in July to explain why its political spending was ‘more important than replacing or repairing the aging transmission lines,’ the company said it needs to make the concerns of its employees, customers and shareholders known to policymakers.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency will limit the science used to write public health rules. From the New York Times: “A new draft of the Environmental Protection Agency proposal, titled Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would require that scientists disclose all of their raw data, including confidential medical records, before the agency could consider an academic study’s conclusions. E.P.A. officials called the plan a step toward transparency and said the disclosure of raw data would allow conclusions to be verified independently. … The measure would make it more difficult to enact new clean air and water rules because many studies detailing the links between pollution and disease rely on personal health information gathered under confidentiality agreements. And, unlike a version of the proposal that surfaced in early 2018, this one could apply retroactively to public health regulations already in place.”

-- Google is engaged with one of the U.S.’s largest health-care systems on a project to collect and analyze the personal health information of millions of people across 21 states. From the Journal: “The initiative, code-named ‘Project Nightingale,’ appears to be the biggest effort yet by a Silicon Valley giant to gain a toehold in the health-care industry through the handling of patients’ medical data. … Google began Project Nightingale in secret last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, a Catholic chain of 2,600 hospitals, doctors’ offices and other facilities, with the data sharing accelerating since summer, according to internal documents. The data involved in the initiative encompasses lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, including patient names and dates of birth. Neither patients nor doctors have been notified. At least 150 Google employees already have access to much of the data on tens of millions of patients, according to a person familiar with the matter and the documents.”

-- A federal health contract funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to at least eight former White House, presidential transition and campaign officials. From Politico: “They were among at least 40 consultants who worked on a one-year, $2.25 million contract directed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma. The contractors were hired to burnish Verma’s personal brand and provide ‘strategic communications’ support. They charged up to $380 per hour for work traditionally handled by dozens of career civil servants in CMS's communications department. The arrangement allowed the Trump allies to cycle through the federal government's opaque contracting system, charging hefty fees with little public oversight or accountability.”

-- Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi called the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a “serious mistake” by the Saudi government, comparing it to the accident involving the tech company’s self-driving car that killed a pedestrian last year. Deanna Paul and Faiz Siddiqui report: “‘It’s a serious mistake. We’ve made mistakes, too — with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we’re recovering from that mistake,’ he said in the episode of ‘Axios on HBO.’ ‘I think that people make mistakes, it doesn’t mean they can never be forgiven. I think they have taken it seriously.’ The car accident was caused by a bad sensor, the interviewer reminded Khosrowshahi, then continued, ‘The CIA suggested that the crown prince had a role in ordering the assassination. That’s a different thing — you didn’t intentionally run someone over.’ About an hour later, Khosrowshahi contacted Axios to clarify his comments on Khashoggi. 'I said something in the moment that I do not believe. When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused,' he wrote in an email, according to the publication.""

-- Southwest Airlines is operating 49 planes that may not have been properly inspected, a top Federal Aviation Administration official said. Lori Aratani reports: “The aircraft in question are among 88 used jets purchased from foreign carriers by Southwest between 2013 and 2017. The planes underwent special inspections, including reviews of their maintenance records, before being cleared to fly, according to the FAA. But now the quality of those inspections is being questioned. … H. Clayton Foushee, director of the FAA’s Office of Audit and Evaluation, raised concerns about the contractors Southwest had used to inspect the aircraft, noting that subsequent reviews by FAA inspectors and the airline had turned up hundreds of instances of undocumented repairs that were made on the planes that were not identified in previous reviews.”

Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick speaks during an interview at his Statehouse office in Boston. (Elise Amendola/AP)

2020 WATCH:

-- Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is seriously considering joining the presidential race. From the Times: Patrick has told Joe Biden and “other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations … Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats. … Mr. Patrick spoke to Mr. Biden in a phone conversation last week that he was weighing a bid, but did not indicate that he had fully decided to run...

“Mr. Patrick’s candidacy could reshape the already-fluid primary field. He is well known in next-door New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary in February. And as one of the first black governors in the country’s history, he could also prove a formidable candidate in South Carolina, where black voters are expected to make up more than half the Democratic electorate. If he is to compete in New Hampshire, Mr. Patrick would have to file there this week: The deadline to appear on the state’s ballot is Friday. A possible Patrick candidacy could complicate the strategic assumptions for a number of candidates, including the two leaders in most polls, Mr. Biden and [Elizabeth] Warren. Mr. Patrick could threaten the former vice president’s support from black voters and also make inroads in New Hampshire, where Ms. Warren is counting on a strong performance in the southern part of the state that borders Massachusetts. He and Ms. Warren have had an amicable, if not personally close relationship; when she was asked at an event last week to name African-Americans she’d want in her cabinet, she included Mr. Patrick.” Patrick has been working at Bain Capital since leaving office in 2015.

-- A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Biden holding a narrow edge in the New Hampshire race. From CNN: “Biden stands at 20%, with [Warren] at 16%, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 15% and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 14% in a tight race for second place. No other candidates reach double digits in the poll.”

-- During a CNN town hall in Iowa, Biden renewed his attacks against Warren’s Medicare-for-all plan, saying it comes from the elitist belief that Americans shouldn’t be allowed to make up their own minds on health care. From CNN: Biden also “said he's merely been responding after ‘she attacked me.’ … Biden said his criticism wasn't about Warren personally, and he went on to describe the attitude he said was behind advocating the health care plan she backs.”

-- Biden’s rivals are scrambling to dent his support from black voters. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Amy B Wang report: “Rather than attack Biden directly, his rivals are mostly deploying tactics that include church visits and tailgate parties, and holding private conversations and teaming up with young influencers who can spread the word. … In the interest of that catch-up, Biden’s rivals are trying to play to whatever strengths they have. Warren is making appeals to black women. Buttigieg and Sanders are aiming at younger activists, largely ceding the older generation to Biden. The goal for Biden’s rivals, at least for now, is not to overtake him among black voters but to come out of the South Carolina primary with at least a respectable showing, Democratic strategists say — and to be well-positioned in case Biden stumbles in Iowa or New Hampshire, which hold votes shortly before South Carolina.”

-- Iowa voters are questioning Buttigieg’s moderate message even as he surges in the polls, reports our former Daily 202 colleague Joan E. Greve now at the Guardian: “With less than three months to go until Iowa voters hold their caucuses, the looming question over Buttigieg’s surprise campaign is whether he will maintain the momentum he has seen in recent weeks or fizzle out as other Democratic candidates have. Some of his opponents’ allies have dismissed the validity of Buttigieg’s surge, calling the young mayor ‘the flavor of the moment.’ But Buttigieg’s campaign insists his current momentum in Iowa is legitimate, powered by more than 100 staffers spread across more than 20 field offices. … Buttigieg’s apparent recalculation away from progressive policies like Medicare for All has led some to question the sincerity of his campaign promises. One rally attendee described the mayor as ‘kind of smarmy’ and suggested he tone down his ‘salesman’ persona. But many attendees were impressed with Buttigieg’s performance on the stump and his evident gifts as a politician. ‘He seems like somebody you’d know down the block, which is very rewarding and comforting,’ said Kate Payne, 61.”

-- Facebook’s top news executive, Campbell Brown, has her own media outlet that has, in recent weeks, harshly attacked Warren. From Popular Information: “In 2015, Brown co-founded The 74, which focuses on the public education system, and served as editor-in-chief. Even after joining Facebook in 2017, Brown has maintained an active role in The 74, where she is a member of the board of directors. … On October 23, The 74 published an article with this headline: ‘Elizabeth Warren’s Education Plan Is Exactly What We Need — If Our Goal Is to Make the Achievement Gap Permanent.’”

-- Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the widow of Elijah Cummings, is running for her late husband’s seat. From the Baltimore Sun: “‘I am, of course, devastated at the loss of my spouse, but his spirit is with me,’ Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, said in an interview with The Baltimore Sun. ‘I’m going to run this race and I’m going to run it hard, as if he’s still right here by my side.’ … Rockeymoore Cummings, a public policy consultant who is founder of the Washington consulting firm Global Policy Solutions LLC and a former 2018 candidate for governor, said her husband told her months before he died he would like for her to succeed him. … Rockeymoore Cummings plans to kick off her campaign Tuesday at her home office in Baltimore’s Madison Park neighborhood. She said she will focus on issues important to the late congressman, such as battling the opioid crisis and ‘fighting for the soul of our democracy’ against the Trump administration, but also on her areas of expertise, which include health and education policy. … Rockeymoore Cummings said she will resign as chairwoman of the state Democratic Party to avoid any appearance of favoritism. That means state Sen. Cory V. McCray will rise to interim chairman.”

-- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it appears Gov. Matt Bevin lost his bid for reelection in Kentucky, even though Bevin still hasn’t conceded the race. From WFPL.org in Louisville: “‘I’m sorry Matt came up short, but he had a good four years and I think all indications are — barring some dramatic reversal on recanvass — that we’ll have a different governor in three weeks,’ McConnell told reporters after an event at North American Stainless in Ghent. The unofficial results of last week’s election showed Beshear defeating Bevin by 5,189 votes … When asked if Bevin should concede following the recanvass, McConnell said he wouldn’t give the governor any advice, but then seemed to urge the governor to move on. ‘My first election was almost the exactly the same number of votes that Beshear won by. We had a recanvass, they added them up, it didn’t change and we all moved on,’ McConnell said.”

-- Also in Kentucky, Democratic state Rep. Charles Booker launched an exploratory committee for a potential run against McConnell. From the Courier Journal: “Booker, 35, a first-term state legislator, told The Courier Journal he filed the paperwork for his committee Monday and plans to launch a statewide listening tour by the end of November before he makes a final decision on whether to run. … He said he's tired of McConnell using Kentucky as a ‘poker chip’ to gain power while the Bluegrass State suffers.”

-- The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments today in a case that will decide the fates of nearly 700,000 “dreamers.” A decision is expected to come next June, during the home stretch of the presidential election. Robert Barnes reports: “The Trump administration has tried for more than two years to ‘wind down’ the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, announced by President Barack Obama in 2012 to protect from deportation qualified young immigrants who came to the country illegally. Individual DACA recipients, giant corporations, civil rights groups and universities have challenged the administration’s plans, and won. Lower courts have found that the administration relied on faulty legal analysis for ending the program, rather than providing lawful reasons that the courts and the public could evaluate. … Dozens of briefs have been filed in what will be one of the court’s marquee cases of the term, many of them only tangentially addressing the legal issues at play. Instead, they extol the doctors, lawyers, engineers, students and military officers whose accomplishments were made possible by the program.”

Smoke rises following an explosion in Gaza early Tuesday. Israeli forces said they carried out an airstrike that killed a senior Palestinian militant. (Mohammed Salem/Reuters)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Israel killed a senior leader of the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad with an airstrike in the Gaza Strip early this morning. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: ""In Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces targeted Baha Abu al-Ata, the militant commander Israel considered responsible for several previous rocket launches on grounds that his next attack was imminent. … In a statement, Palestinian Islamic Jihad confirmed that Abu Al Ata and his wife were killed. … The overnight action was approved by [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu."" Former army chief of staff Benny Gantz, who is trying to form a coalition government, supported the action.

-- Turkey deported U.S. and Danish citizens who fought for ISIS and made plans to expel other foreign nationals, as Ankara begins a new push to send back captured foreign fighters to their home countries. From the AP: “Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said last week that about 1,200 foreign IS fighters were in Turkish prisons and 287 members, including women and children, were recaptured during Turkey’s offensive in Syria. Several European countries, including Britain, have stripped IS fighters of their nationalities to prevent their return. … Turkey’s Sabah newspaper, which is close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government, reported that the U.S. citizen who had been deported was stuck in a heavily militarized no man’s land between the Greece and Turkey borders. … In Denmark, Justice Minister Nick Hakkerup told Danish broadcaster TV2 that any Danish citizens who fought for IS and are repatriated to the country ‘must be punished as severely as possible.’”

-- Ahead of Erdogan’s visit to Washington tomorrow, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) asked the State Department to ban the leader’s bodyguards from entering the country. From National Review: “In May 2017, members of the Turkish Presidential Protection Department (TPPD), Turkey’s equivalent of the Secret Service, attacked pro-Kurdish protesters outside the residence of the Turkish ambassador. The assault, in which protesters and American law-enforcement officials were injured, was captured on video. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Cheney requested that ‘none of the people who were in the United States with President Erdoğan in 2017 and participated in physical attacks on American citizens—including those protesting lawfully, our secret service, our diplomatic service, and our law enforcement officials—will be allowed into the United States again this week.’ … The letter comes in advance of a planned White House visit by Erdogan this Wednesday.”

-- Trump is looking forward to Erdogan’s visit, and he may be the only one in town, laments The Post’s Editorial Board: “Erdogan has jailed hundreds of journalists, academics and others he perceives as political opponents, and purged thousands from their jobs. His offensive into northeastern Syria, under the guise of fighting terrorism and greenlighted by Mr. Trump, has led to ethnic cleansing of Kurds, created a humanitarian disaster and compromised the fight against the Islamic State. He has been emboldened by Mr. Trump’s eagerness to retreat from the region, and there’s little hope that the administration will speak up for the rule of law in Turkey. It is up to Congress to protest — and hopefully mitigate — the damage Mr. Erdogan is causing.”

-- Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced the conditional release of three high profile Taliban prisoners in exchange for kidnapped American and Australian professors. Sharif Hassan reports: “Speaking live on local TV channels in Kabul, Ghani said the decision was taken to and bring ‘peace and stability’ in the country. ‘In consultations with our international partners especially the U.S., we have adopted a mechanism and approach to make sure the release of these three men wouldn’t reinforce the … enemy and intensify attacks by them,’ he said. All three prisoners are members of deadly Haqqani wing of the Taliban that include Anas Haqqani, a younger brother of the group’s leader, Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid. They were held in a government detention center inside Bagram military base. The professors are a U.S. national, Kevin King, and Australian, Timothy Weeks. Both were teaching at the American University of Afghanistan and were kidnapped in 2016.”

-- In Iraq, protesters continue withstanding bullets, tear gas and stun grenades as they call for the ouster of the entire political class. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “More than 319 people have been killed and 15,000 wounded since anti-government demonstrations began in Baghdad and southern cities on Oct. 1, according to the country’s human rights commission. As crowds start to thin, a broader crackdown is starting. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested. Volunteer medics have disappeared on their way to Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, not heard from since. In dozens of interviews, protesters and medics described intelligence officers and unknown individuals appearing in tents full of friends, taking photographs on cellphones and leaving. Activists showed messages on their phones advising them to go home or making blunter threats.”

-- James Le Mesurier, a former British Army officer who founded the White Helmets defense group in Syria and has drawn the ire of the Kremlin, was found dead in Turkey. From the BBC: “Mr Le Mesurier's body was found at about 04:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on the street near his home and office in Istanbul's Beyoglu district on the European side of the city. He was found with fractures to his head and legs, Turkish media say, and is believed to have fallen from his balcony. … The Syrian government and its allies Russia and Iran have accused the White Helmets of openly aiding terrorist organizations and the Russian foreign ministry last week accused Mr. Le Mesurier of being a former agent of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6. The Russian allegation was strongly denied on Monday by Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the UN, who said: ‘The Russian charges against him, that came out of the foreign ministry that he was a spy, are categorically untrue.’”

-- The Trump administration is drafting plans to condition U.S. aid to other countries on how well they treat their religious minorities. From Politico: “The proposal is expected to cover U.S. humanitarian assistance, and could also be broadened to include American military aid to other countries. If the proposal becomes reality, it could have a major effect on U.S. assistance in a range of places, from Iraq to Vietnam. Its mere consideration shows how much the White House prioritizes religious freedom, an emphasis critics say is really about galvanizing Trump’s evangelical Christian base. But experts on U.S. aid also warn that picking and choosing which countries to punish could be a very difficult task, not least because several countries that are partners or allies of the United States have terrible religious freedom records.”

-- Bolivia’s Evo Morales flew off to Mexico after being ousted. From the Guardian: “Earlier on Monday evening Morales tweeted a farewell after his resignation in the wake of a disputed election, saying that he would be take up the offer of asylum in Mexico but would soon ‘return with greater strength and energy.’ The Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted a picture of the former leader draped in the flag of Mexico, and said: ‘The Mexican Air Force plane has already taken off with Evo Morales on board. According to current international conventions, it is under the protection of Mexico. Your life and integrity are safe.’ … A senior US official said that Washington did not consider Morales resignation and departure to constitute a coup. ‘All these events clearly show is the Bolivian people have simply had enough of a government ignoring the will of its voters,’ the official said. … In Mexico Ebrard issued a statement on Monday defining what had happened as a ‘military coup’ and calling for an urgent meeting of the OAS.”

-- So, was what happened in Bolivia a coup? Bolivians are still trying to figure that out. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “All four officials in the constitutional line of succession — the president, the vice president and the heads of the senate and chamber of deputies, all socialists — resigned on Sunday. That left remaining lawmakers scrambling to cobble together a quorum to appoint a new leader — something they appeared unable to do Monday. … Carlos Mesa, the former president who finished second to Morales last month, rejected the word ‘coup.’ Speaking to reporters Monday, he called the events of the previous 24 hours a ‘democratic popular action’ to stop a government that had committed election fraud to install itself as an authoritarian power. … Debate over whether democracy had been restored or broken raged across the region. Morales’s socialists were accused of stealing an election. But critics said the military’s decision to pull its support and the mob rule that forced him out were anything but constitutional. Views fell largely along ideological lines, exposing the political divisions among and within Latin American nations and also the sensitivity to a word — ‘coup’ — that invokes images of 20th-century military interventions in the region, many of them backed by the United States.”

-- Spain was once thought to be immune to the far-right. That changed this past weekend. Chico Harlan and Pamela Rolfe report: “After the Vox party cracked open the door to parliament in April and came in third in national elections on Sunday, Spain can be singled out for something else: Among major European countries, it is where the far right is gaining ground most quickly. … The Socialist party claimed the most votes in Sunday’s elections — but there was no obvious path for any party on the left or right to easily form a government in Spain’s fragmented system. The Socialists, led by acting prime minister Pedro Sánchez, won 120 of 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies. The center-right Popular Party, which has been plagued by corruption scandals, came in second with 88 seats. And Vox finished with 52, compared with 24 seats in elections in April.”

-- The U.K.’s Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage offered Prime Minister Boris Johnson a truce, upping his chances of success in next month’s election. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Farage said he would not field candidates for the 317 seats that Johnson’s Conservative Party won in 2017. That means, in half of Britain, voters who hunger to leave the European Union will not have to decide between a pro-Brexit Conservative candidate and a really, really pro-Brexit Brexit Party candidate.”

-- Australia’s former top diplomat in the U.K., Alexander Downer, said Australia should reduce its UK intelligence sharing if Jeremy Corbyn wins the election. From the Guardian: “In an excoriating assessment of the Labour leader at the National Press Club in Canberra, Downer contended that a Corbyn victory would imperil substantial Australian investments in Britain, and would trigger a reassessment of the ‘very intimate’ security relationship between Canberra and London.”

-- Israel extradited Russian hacker Aleksey Burkov to the U.S. despite Moscow’s protests. From the Times of Israel: “Burkov, who was arrested in 2015 at the request of Interpol, is wanted in the US on embezzlement charges over a massive credit card scheme that saw him allegedly steal millions of dollars from American consumers. His fate is believed linked to Russia’s sentencing last month of Israeli-American Naama Issachar, 26, to seven and a half years in prison for drug offenses. Israeli officials have decried the sentence as disproportionate and appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin for her release.”

-- Kremlin-linked business owner Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is under U.S. sanctions for his ties to the Internet Research Agency that’s been indicted for interference in the 2016 presidential election, split his business empire with a 27-year-old. From the Moscow Times: “A close Putin ally, Prigozhin is also linked to the Wagner Group of private mercenaries which has reportedly fought alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, been sent to provide personal security to Venezuelean President Nicolas Maduro, and been deployed in the Central African Republic, Mozambique, Madagascar, Libya, eastern Ukraine and Sudan. Prigozhin’s decision to cede half of his main business interest is

-- Don Cherry, the longtime NHL commentator, was fired by the Canadian broadcaster Sportsnet after making divisive comments about immigrants on the air. Cherry, an often controversial commentator, criticized immigrants in Canada for not recognizing Remembrance Day, which many Canadians celebrate by wearing small artificial poppies. “You people love — you, that come here, whatever it is — you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey,” Cherry said. “At least you could pay a couple of bucks for poppies or something like that. These guys paid for your way of life, that you enjoy in Canada.” (Matt Bonesteel, Ben Strauss and Des Bieler)

You can understand why Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar is annoyed by the relative success on the presidential campaign trail of South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. She’s easily won three Senate races in a state that’s been trending Republican. Buttigieg has twice been elected mayor of the 306th largest city in America. She’s the next-door senator to Iowa Democrats. Pete’s town is more than 400 miles from Des Moines. Klobuchar’s claim to represent the Democratic mainstream against the dangerous lefty-progressives threatening to take over the party is based on an extensive Senate voting record. Buttigieg’s “fighting centrist” credentials are mostly a matter of assertion, and didn’t really emerge even in this campaign for a good while.

Yet Buttigieg leads Klobuchar in the RealClearPolitics polling averages for Iowa by 17.5 percent to 4.0 percent; for New Hampshire by 11.3 percent to 3.3 percent; and nationally by 7.0 percent to 2.6 percent. He’s raised a lot more money than Klobuchar: over $50 million so far in 2017, compared to her $18.8 million. Her explanation for this disparity seems pretty simple, and got some attention when she repeated it on CNN’s Sunday show this last weekend (as reported by the Washington Post):

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Sunday that women in politics are held to a higher standard than men, arguing that a female candidate with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s experience probably would not make it to the presidential debate stage.

Klobuchar’s comments mark the latest instance of a 2020 presidential contender taking aim at Buttigieg, a newcomer on the national political stage whose ascent in the fundraising race and in polls for the Democratic nomination has taken many by surprise.

They also bring renewed attention to the hurdles female candidates face, following former vice president Joe Biden’s description last week of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as “angry” and antagonistic.

As it happens, both Buttigieg and Klobuchar have already qualified for the November and December debates. So I guess in theory she’s not talking about herself but instead of some hypothetical woman. But Klobuchar also clearly wants to convey that she is being held to a double standard, too:

Klobuchar, who is on her third term in the Senate, described herself as “the one from the Midwest that’s actually won in a statewide race over and over again,” adding, “That’s not true of Mayor Pete.”

So the not-so-veiled suggestion is that Buttigieg’s success is principally the product of male (or perhaps white male) privilege.

Buttigieg has answered this charge earlier in the campaign, acknowledging his privileges but observing that it’s not the whole story of his candidacy, as Laura Bradley observed back in April:

[W]hen host Trevor Noah asked “Mayor Pete” whether he believes he’s benefited from white privilege, Buttigieg responded by acknowledging both that those privileges exist and that he’s considered that very question.

“I’d like to believe it’s my qualities and my message,” Buttigieg told Noah. “But I’ve been reflecting on this because one of the things about privilege, especially things like white privilege or male privilege, is that you don’t think about it very much. It’s being in an out-group where you are constantly reminded of it. It’s not when you are in a majority or a privileged group. And so, I try to check myself and make sure I try to understand the factors that help explain why things are going well.”

Pete probably didn’t have to say it out loud, but his other defense is that he, too, is a member of an “out-group” thanks to his gay sexual identity. So he’s not just some random vaguely centrist white male dude like Steve Bullock or Michael Bennet, whom Buttigieg is also trouncing in the polls, not to mention Beto O’Rourke, John Hickenlooper, Seth Moulton, or Tim Ryan, who have already dropped out. Each and every one of them had a better résumé than Pete, but that didn’t matter. And as a New York Times piece this week suggested, lots of candidates both resent and envy Buttigieg:

“It is a natural thing when a young candidate comes along and has success for other candidates who feel like they’ve toiled in the vineyards to resent it,” said David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama in 2008. “I think they’d like him better if he weren’t doing as well …”

Campaign aides acknowledge privately that Mr. Buttigieg triggers some of his rivals. But they dismiss the criticism as little more than sour grapes. Over last weekend in Iowa, he drew crowds of several hundred people in towns that numbered just a few thousand.

And it’s blind quotes like that which make other camps resent Mayor Pete even more.

Some observers assume Buttigieg’s sexual orientation is a handicap. But Gallup data show how rapidly that is ceasing to be an issue: Currently 83 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of independents (and even 61 percent of Republicans) deem themselves willing to vote for a gay or lesbian president, and the trend lines are clearly and quickly moving toward more acceptance of LGBTQ pols, and people generally. Meanwhile, being openly gay has pretty clearly helped Buttigieg raise money, as the New York Times reported in April:

After vaulting into the top tier of presidential candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination — going from “adorable” to “plausible,” in his own words — Mr. Buttigieg is building on the fly a nationwide network of donors that is anchored by many wealthy and well-connected figures in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political circles.

From more intimate cocktail parties on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where the composer Stephen Sondheim appeared in March, to larger events, like a planned June gala at the Beverly Hills home of the television producer Ryan Murphy, the L.G.B.T. donor base is helping push Mr. Buttigieg from the margins of the presidential contest into the same moneyed circles that raised millions of dollars for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Top L.G.B.T. donors face no shortage of loyal allies among the 20 Democratic candidates. But Mr. Buttigieg’s candidacy has struck an especially powerful chord with many of them. Though many said they believed they would see a gay man or lesbian become a serious contender for the White House one day, most of them had never considered it beyond the abstract. Mr. Buttigieg’s ascent has made a sudden and unexpected reality of something they thought was still years away, if not decades.

So Buttigieg’s sexual orientation is an “identity politics” credential for him that matters not just to LGBTQ folks, but to those who care about equality and breaking “glass ceilings.” Buttigieg would probably be the first to acknowledge that his claim to pioneer status is not as powerful as that of Barack Obama’s in 2008 (which the at time was resented by some feminists backing Hillary Clinton) or HRC’s in 2016. But it’s real, and the fact that he is married, religiously observant, and a military veteran adds a traditionalist twist to his background and identity which some voters likely find appealing — along with his much-discussed verbal skills. His youth, in an age-heavy field and in a party unusually dependent on millennial and post-millennial votes, is also an asset. And it’s worth noting that he didn’t exactly come out of nowhere: His well-regarded if unsuccessful 2017 race for DNC chair earned him a lot of good will, as Business Insider reported at the time:

John Verdejo had never heard of Pete Buttigieg before the Democratic National Committee chair’s race. By Saturday’s vote, he had only one impression of the South Bend, Indiana, mayor.

“Mind. Blown. Mind. Blown. You ask any of the DNC members here, and he was their second choice. I don’t care if you voted for Perez first, Ellison first — Buttigieg was their No. 2,” the North Carolina DNC member said here at the committee’s winter meeting in Atlanta.

None of this is to say that Buttigieg’s current position is stable, or fully earned. His “whiteness” is indeed an issue in the nominating contest, thanks to the trouble he has had dealing with police-minority relations in South Bend, and that may doom his candidacy when the contest moves past the very white states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

But the idea that Pete Buttigieg’s gender is the only reason anyone would prefer him to Amy Klobuchar a bit of a reach.

Now if Klobuchar was really arguing that a woman exactly like Pete Buttigieg — a married, lesbian, small-city mayor with military service who attends church and is unusually articulate about a more-or-less-centrist policy agenda – wouldn’t be doing as well as he is, thanks to media or voting bias or whatever — well, that’s a different proposition. But it’s not one we will get to test in 2020."

First it was Michael Bloomberg. Now it’s former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick considering throwing his hat into the once-shrinking, now possibly expanding, ring of Democratic candidates. (Oh, and possibly Hillary Clinton for good measure.) But could Patrick actually make a difference in the race? I spoke with national correspondent Gabriel Debenedetti and political columnist Ed Kilgore to try to figure it out.

Ben: Deval Patrick seemed like a possibly promising presidential candidate about a year ago. Then he became among the first high-profile names to declare he wouldn’t run, citing, reasonably enough, the “cruelty of our elections process.” Now, in a twist I don’t really think anyone saw coming, he might jump in at the last minute after all. Could he shake up the race, or this mostly just wishful thinking on his end?

Gabriel: Depends what you mean by “shake up,” but it’s hard to see how he could come in this late and win if he’s really trying to compete in New Hampshire (which, notably, Mike Bloomberg is saying he wouldn’t do). All indications are the former Massachusetts governor wants to play in the early state, but it’s been organized and advertised in by the other candidates for a year.

Ed: He’s got until Friday (the NH filing deadline) to lie down and get over it.

Sorry to usurp Ben’s role, but I do have a question for Gabe: How much of this do you think just reflects the famous “donor panic” we’ve been hearing so much about?

Ben: I was getting to that…

Gabriel: I don’t know about donors who have been encouraging Patrick, specifically. But there’s definitely a feeling of “AAHH! We need someone else!” in much of the professional political class that’s simply not reflected in the primary electorate. As I pointed out in my story about Bloomberg yesterday, a recent USC/LAT poll showed only 4 percent of Democratic primary voters are undecided because they’re unsatisfied with the candidates. All that said, it’s definitely true that a lot of donors (and strategists and former pols and people that just generally like to think of themselves as savvy) are very, very worried about the field and, most importantly, the front-running candidates’ ability to beat Trump. No doubt Patrick feels the same way and has participated in such conversations, or we wouldn’t be here. I mean, every day I get texts from political pros, donors, and retired electeds wondering “who else might be out there?”

Ed: Well, Patrick does work at Bain Capital.

Gabriel: To back up for a second, the idea of a Patrick candidacy was not far-fetched at all around a year ago.

Ed: A big part of his promise, though, was the implied support of a certain former president and his circle.

Gabriel: You mean Carter?

Ed: Haha. I was going to say Bill Clinton.

Gabriel: Kidding. Last year, there were very influential corners of ObamaWorld (insofar as “ObamaWorld” is still a real thing) that took Patrick 2020 much more seriously than the potential candidacies of the other two Obama friends who were looking at it, Joe Biden and Eric Holder. So that wasn’t a crazy premise. (Michael Bennet is also an Obama friend, but, well. Yeah.)

It’s true he’s been working at Bain Capital, which would obviously be hard to maneuver politically, but the idea of a moderate former governor who is close with Obama, who could theoretically be very competitive in New Hampshire and South Carolina, was a promising one.

Ed: Julián Castro was in his Cabinet.

Gabriel: Indeed, but never a personal friend.

Ben: As many have noted, not only are Democrats satisfied with their choices, according to the polls, but the great moderate hope, Joe Biden, is doing perfectly fine in national and most state polls — just not so much Iowa and New Hampshire. Does the apparent concern about his candidacy have more to do with his ability to win the primary and/or general, or a certain level of alarm about his slips of the tongue and faculties in general? It’s not like the latter concern hasn’t been around for quite a while now.

Gabriel: Well, the concern is that the latter is feeding into the former.

Ed: Is there any intel suggesting that these fears about Uncle Joe extend deeply into the circles of the 44th president? Because any hint of Obama giving up on Biden could really set off the kindling beneath his campaign.

Ben: Ed, I’ll ask the questions here.

Gabriel: None of this would be happening, of course, if Biden were in a stronger position. But the overarching fear that’s causing it is that he would lose to Trump. Secondarily, it’s that he can’t even get out of the primary and someone even less acceptable to the general population would win it.

No, Obama has been extremely careful not to send any signals.

Ben: Do you find there to be a mismatch between the donor sentiment and what you see on the ground, though, in terms of Biden’s actual capabilities to make it through the primary?

Gabriel: Of course. There’s a mismatch in donor sentiment and voter sentiment on, like, everything right now. It’s just a mismatch, though, not a total disagreement. There’s a reason Pete Buttigieg is having a moment right now — a lot of people who might otherwise be interested in Biden are giving him a look. A lot of donors, too. The idea that Biden is vulnerable isn’t exactly a niche one born of Wall Street.

Ed: Trouble is, of course, that Biden has blocked the emergence of what donors probably want — another Bill Clinton or Barack Obama: a centrist with charisma and an interesting story.

Ben: And that’s where Mayor Pete comes in.

Ed: Yeah, but you can see why he would not be the answer to every donor’s prayer. His inability to appeal to African-Americans (which Patrick presumably could do) and his brief résumé (Patrick’s is fine) are problems, even if his sexual orientation isn’t considered a handicap.You could almost see Patrick’s name emerge from a discussion of why Buttigieg isn’t the answer.

Ben: We should note, though, that the current black candidates in the race aren’t exactly doing great numbers among black voters. Joe Biden continues to dominate there.

Gabriel: A lot of this gets to what I noted above: Patrick had a lot of promise when he was first considering the race. The thing I’m unsure of now is what dynamics would change with him in it, other than the novelty generating news coverage, and therefore some attention that might be good for him.

Ben: Back then, I recall chatting about whether he would actually be appealing to voters. Bain Capital was seen as a possible albatross.

Ed: Yeah, I’m not saying I think Patrick makes sense; just trying to make sense of why he’s getting this very late boomlet of interest.

Gabriel: I’m not convinced there is a boomlet of interest at all. Just a boomlet of “My name is Deval Patrick, and I might be interested.”

Ben: Are there other big names we should be expecting to jump in over the next few weeks? Andrew Cuomo? Al Gore? Walter Mondale?

Ed: No.

Gabriel: Maybe Cory Booker should leak to the Times that he’s considering filing for the New Hampshire primary, and he’ll get a front-page story too. (No.)

Ed: Haha. But seriously, it’s the filing deadlines that are creating this little squall. When a few more pass, it will probably end.

Gabriel: Yes, exactly. And that’s actually one of the things that makes this all slightly baffling, as I said up top. If Patrick thinks he can seriously compete for NH, that would be a massive development, and I would be fascinated to see the data he’s looking at.

Ben: Is there nothing that would point to that being a possibility? He was a popular governor in my home state of Massachusetts, across the border. He’s a skilled politician and, like his friend Obama, an excellent orator — among the best in this field, for sure.

Ed: Last Massachusetts pol to come in late and sweep the New Hampshire primary was Henry Cabot Lodge in 1964 … and he was in Saigon.

Ben: Good history lesson.

Gabriel: As far as I can tell, there were zero NH polls this cycle before Patrick took himself out of the running. There’s no obvious evidence that he’d do well there. Of course, he’s from next door. But so are two other candidates who’ve been near-constant presences in NH for a year, or, in one case, five years.

Ben: So is this really just a lesson about how big your average politican’s ego really is?

Gabriel: I don’t know if this is all about ego. He was a successful governor! But it is a lesson about how nervous professional Democrats are.

Ed: For reasons we’ve talked about off and on all cycle, this is a year in which an awful lot of pols are going to see the next president of the United States in the mirror: the Trump ’16 example, the sense that this is the highest-stakes election of our era, and now the very size of the field which makes the emergence of a real front-runner so difficult."

Times appended a correction to the story, but the write-ups, hot takes and notions of Buttigieg as an Obama critic had already gone into the world. Interestingly — and worryingly — to some journalism and communications experts, the correction did not necessarily sway everyone who had reacted to a now-debunked premise.

“It does reinforce the velocity of social media and Twitter and taking comments — true or not, in context or not — and magnifying them exponentially,” Bill Grueskin, who teaches about trends in journalism and digital media at Columbia Journalism School, told The Washington Post. “It shows what happens when you go too fast. The results can be catastrophic.”

The virality of the Buttigieg misquote comes amid the ramp-up to a high-stakes election cycle that is increasingly driven by social media; it also indicates how the intensifying speed and reach of inaccurate information threatens to further erode public trust in the news at the same time audiences retreat further into ideological bubbles.

To illustrate the reach of just one tentacle of the misinformation, Clemson University communications professor Darren Linvill used a data tool to scrape Twitter for every mention of the specific misquoted phrase — “failures of the Obama era” — from when the L.A. Times article went live Sunday afternoon to 5 p.m. Eastern on Monday. The results showed nearly 20,000 tweets discussing the quote that were a mix of reactions to the misquote and the later correction. Linvill notes the 20,000 tweets are not representative of the entirety of the discussion about the Buttigieg story on Twitter and only capture a slice of the conversation, based on the search term (it also does not include tweets that were deleted before the search query).

AD

AD

Linvill, who spent the past year and a half studying how Russian “trolls” used social media to negatively influence political discourse during the 2016 presidential election, saw the barest of silver linings after a quick perusal of the data: There did not appear to be any targeted efforts by trolls or foreign agents to weaponize the story.

The downside: That means the story and its offshoots that perpetuated further misinformed tweets spread organically. That, Linvill said, is a particularly hard kind of disinformation to neutralize.

“Spin is very hard to counter because people want to believe what they’re already inclined to believe … it’s really difficult to stop and properly assess the information. That’s fundamentally how good disinformation works,” Linvill said. “And it’s even more difficult because [the Buttigieg quote] wasn’t a lie, it was a mistake.""

AD

AD

Getting incorrect information from a credible source is especially hard to combat, he said. Journalism ethicists have long warned that corrections never reach the full audience of an initial mistake. Linvill said he noticed, however, some people who saw the Buttigieg correction were unmoved by the facts.

“[What’s] scary is that if you look at the replies to Evan Halper’s retraction, [it’s] the number of people who say, ‘I don’t believe you’ — in reference to his retraction,” Linvill said.

Journalism experts agreed mistakes are serious but also inevitable. They said Halper, the L.A. Times reporter, did the right thing by owning his mistake and explaining why it happened (“the result of transcribing a noisy recording at a loud rally,” he tweeted in his correction). Halper went on to share Buttigieg’s full quote in context:

AD

AD

“I think because I come from a part of the country where normal has been a real problem for a very long time, and I think the failures of the old normal help explain how we got to Trump, I am much more interested in building a future that is going to have a lot of differences.”

“My biggest concern isn’t this particular error — my concern is that it’s one more matchstick thrown on the bonfire of people distrusting the media across the political divide,” said Vivian Schiller, CEO of the Civil Foundation, a media nonprofit focused on sustainability and transparency in journalism.

“Now we live in an era [where] you unleash a story and you lose control of it immediately,” she added.

AD

By the time the correction was issued, the misquote had already taken on a life of its own: Various news outlets published stories about the statement (many later issued corrections on their report of the quote); Buttigieg competitors like former HUD Secretary Julián Castro tweeted (then later deleted) rebukes of Buttigieg; former vice president Joe Biden fired off a conspicuously timed tweet praising Obama.

AD

“The minute the reporter retracted the quote, it went from misinformation to disinformation,” Schiller said, drawing a distinction between inaccurate information borne of honest mistakes and intentional efforts to deceive. “Anyone still propagating and ginning up conspiracy theories about it now knows full well that the correction has been issued. They’re taking misinformation [and weaponizing] it into disinformation.”

It is unknown whether the mistake will have a lingering impact on Buttigieg’s campaign. On Twitter, he was gracious about the mistake and took the opportunity to reaffirm his appreciation of Obama.

I appreciate this reporter’s swift and honest correction of a misquote on my views of the Obama presidency. From health care to DADT repeal to the rescue of the auto industry, my appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place. https://t.co/eWvSDtcpTQ — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) November 11, 2019

The Glezmans’ story, with all its rifts, love and sadness, became a private matter gone painfully public. Religious conservatives and gay rights activists across America took sides, and a once-close family was pulled further apart.

On the campaign trail, Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, cites Scripture often — in part, he has said, to build a bridge to the religious right. But the divide within his in-laws’ family highlights how difficult that may be. The split is resonating even more since Chasten, a 30-year-old former schoolteacher, has attracted his own enthusiastic following and begun holding solo campaign events separate from Buttigieg.

“I think in some ways he’s modeling what kind of a first spouse he might be,” Buttigieg said on a recent bus tour through Iowa, of Chasten’s visits to schools and LGBTQ centers. “I talk about my story, [but] I think his story is even more of somebody whose life has really been shaped by the political decisions of others.”

Beyond the primary, it’s not clear how the broader electorate will react to a candidate who is in a same-sex marriage, something that’s never been tested on the presidential level before.

A family split goes public

The Glezman family’s strains erupted several months ago when Chasten told The Washington Post about his childhood in Michigan and his anxiety about coming out in high school. He recounted giving his parents a letter — he was afraid to say “I’m gay” aloud — and said his mother responded by asking whether he was sick, perhaps with AIDS.

That prompted a silence in the household so hostile he was forced to leave home for a while, Chasten said. The article quoted Chasten saying of his brothers, “We never got over it,” and Rhyan adding, “I just don’t support the gay lifestyle.”

The next day, Rhyan woke up to dozens of messages calling him a bigot, a homophobe and worse. “It kind of blindsided me,” Rhyan said.

Beyond that, he felt Christianity itself was under assault. So after much prayer, he reached out to Faithwire.com to tell his side of the story, prompting the headline, “Pete Buttigieg’s pastor brother-in-law blasts ‘false narrative’ in WaPo report smearing him as ‘bigot.’ ” Other right-leaning outlets soon jumped on the story.

AD

In Rhyan’s telling, their parents were in fact very supportive of Chasten, and it was Rhyan who got the cold shoulder when he announced he was giving himself to Jesus.

Now he says Buttigieg’s candidacy is giving him a way to defend the faith. “If I’m able to help extend the truth of Jesus, if I’m able to help unify the LGBT community and evangelicals together as human beings . . . in a small way, I’m definitely open,” Rhyan said. “I’m very grateful and very humbled by the new, I guess you could say, platform.”

The Buttigieg campaign declined requests for Chasten to comment for this article, but emphasized that Rhyan Glezman does not speak for the family. Buttigieg himself, while not directly addressing the attacks on Chasten, says the Gospel’s message is to protect those less fortunate. In speeches, he has directed a question to Vice President Pence that in a sense is aimed at religious conservatives more broadly: “Is it that he stopped believing in Scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump?”

The Glezmans’ story may seem almost biblical, but unlike Cain and Abel or Jacob and Esau, Rhyan and Chasten have a middle brother. Dustin Glezman, neither preacher nor politico but a landscaper in Georgia, has tried to avoid the spotlight.

And it largely worked, until a reporter from the Daily Mail showed up at his house. Dustin told him he agreed with Rhyan that the family had never mistreated Chasten.

In an interview, Dustin said he is taken aback by the way his ordinary Midwestern family is being wracked by the furor around his brother-in-law’s campaign.

“I’ve seen [what happened to] my older brother, how it all blew up,” Dustin said. “I’m just a little guy here in Georgia. I don’t think we had any issues until all this started. When Pete started running for president, I think that’s when everything started getting more distant, you know what I mean?”

Sticking up for 'Little Glez'

The Glezman brothers grew up in a Catholic household in Traverse City, Mich., where religion was a quiet underpinning but not a center of conversation. Their memories diverge regarding their parents’ political leanings: Chasten describes his parents as conservative, while Rhyan and Dustin remember them as liberal.

The two older brothers played just about any sport they could. “I would honestly say I had an amazing childhood,” said Dustin, recalling summers on the family pontoon boat on Michigan’s lakes. “I can’t remember any negative thing. We had everything.”

Chasten’s memories, though, are more complicated. He was “Mom’s boy” — shopping, going to movies and working around the house with Sherri Glezman — while his brothers went hunting and worked on trucks with Terry Glezman. (Sherri and Terry Glezman declined interview requests.)

“We definitely didn’t spend a lot of time together in harmony,” Chasten told The Post in April.

At school, Rhyan and Dustin were jocks while Chasten was called “Little Glez,” a nickname he didn’t love. He struggled with a sense that he didn’t fit in with his athletic brothers. In his high school of 1,500, he knew of no students or teachers who were openly gay; he came out after graduating.

“It was simply unsafe to be out, it was unsafe to be gay,” he would say later.

Once, when he was getting picked on in the hallway, he remembers Dustin stepping in and throwing his tormentor against a locker. He told him not to mess with his brother again, then immediately walked away, according to Chasten.

AD

“I don’t think he wanted his brother to be hurt, and he probably was embarrassed that somebody probably thought that I was gay,” Chasten said. “That’s not to say that my brothers would never have stuck up for me — because they did, on multiple occasions. We were just in different tribes.”

Skull tattoo, 'Cowboy Bible'

Today, Rhyan’s right arm is covered in tattoos. A large skull on the forearm and a cluster of smaller skulls leading to his shoulder are reminders of what he calls his “pre-Christian” past as a partyer and wild man.

Rhyan embraced religion a few years after college, and he grew quiet recently when asked how that decision was received by his family. Speaking generally, he said some people did not believe him, and others assumed it was a phase.

AD

One day last year when Rhyan was on the phone with Dustin, his middle brother also decided to become an evangelical Christian. The two now talk regularly, and Dustin occasionally watches online as Rhyan leads church services.

Rhyan says he longs to reconcile with his youngest brother, too. “I do look for that day,” he said. “But reconciliation is a two-way street.”

Rhyan said he loves Chasten and sees everyone as a child of God. When he reads online comments calling him a bigot, he doesn’t understand how anyone can think so. “The best for anyone — my brother or anyone — is recognizing their need for Jesus,” Rhyan said.

AD

But for Chasten, rejecting homosexuality is rejecting who he is. “We still live in a country where we have to second-guess whether it is okay for us to talk about our husbands and our wives,” Chasten said in June to the Ingham County, Mich., Democrats.

“When the stranger on the airplane tells you about his wife and his kids and then asks you, ‘So what about you?’ is it okay for me to say, ‘I live with my husband in Indiana?’ I still have to ask myself that every day.”

When Rhyan graduated from college, he struggled to find a career, working as a police officer and then a mixed martial arts fighter. By 2012, he was married and running a landscaping business.

But he still felt empty, he says — until, looking for some kind of sign, he descended to the basement and retrieved a book he’d received years earlier called “The Cowboy Bible,” adorned with a man on a horse. His eyes fell on a passage: “Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.”

AD

Later that day he was talking to a friend, and he spontaneously quoted the same passage, even though he’d had no idea Rhyan had been reading the Bible that day. Rhyan felt a jolt; this was the divine message he’d been seeking.

The next morning, he wept. “Up to this point, I was a very kind of rough, gruff, don’t-cry type of person, and I had this overwhelming emotion come over me that I just, I couldn’t explain,” Rhyan said. “So from that day forward, I just completely surrendered.”

He showed up at a nearby church, grew more involved and eventually felt called to become a pastor.

Two versions of Christianity

The Community Church of God, which Rhyan now leads, sits on a grassy lot in Clio, a tiny city north of Flint, Mich., with a population of 2,500. He took the stage on a recent Sunday following a performance of Christian worship songs, telling the crowd of about 80 that the day’s sermon would be about authentic vs. inauthentic Christianity.

“Anyone can claim to be a Christian,” he said. “I could say I play for the Chicago Bulls.”

He spoke faster, almost spitting out the words. “Our opinions really don’t matter. Our opinions should not matter. What we think Christianity should be like?” He let his disdain for that notion hang in the air. “What does God’s word say for his children?”

“Amen,” a woman’s voice rose from the audience.

Buttigieg, in contrast, speaks on the campaign trail both about his Christianity and his support for gay rights — a position Rhyan considers deeply anti-Christian.

Over the summer months, as the Democratic primary heated up, it became especially galling to Rhyan to see Buttigieg repeatedly depicting the Christian right as hypocritical and saying it failed to stand up for the oppressed, including gay people.

“You shouldn’t be misrepresenting the Bible and publicly contradicting God’s word,” Rhyan said. “He’s manipulating stories in the Scripture to make his points.”

Rhyan says he nonetheless tried to lay low and avoid a second flare-up — until late summer when he saw clips of a Buttigieg interview with the radio show “The Breakfast Club,” where he characterized abortion as a complex issue.

“There’s a lot of parts of the Bible,” Buttigieg said on the show. “Even that is something that we can interpret differently.”

Rhyan took to Twitter to blast Buttigieg for his “false religion.” Soon, a producer from Tucker Carlson’s show reached out to Rhyan, and once again he was in a studio in Detroit, this time as a Fox News illustration of “Saint Pete” flashed on-screen.

“I would like to make a plea to Pete Buttigieg, my brother-in-law, that he would reconsider his position and the way he is misrepresenting Scripture to push this pro-abortion platform that he’s pushing,” Rhyan said.

The first gentleman of South Bend

As that side of the debate plays out, Chasten is sending a very different message, through tweets, campaign talks and other venues, about tolerance, feminism and gay rights.

“So here’s the thing,” he posted recently. “You can look at that tweet...(that really nasty tweet. The gross, homophobic tweet. The blatantly racist tweet. The ‘fire you up with fake outrage’ click-bait news article tweet) and just say ‘nope.’ Scroll away. Don’t engage. Adios gross tweet. Not today.”

As Buttigieg’s star has risen, so too has Chasten’s. A former teacher at a Montessori school, the “first gentleman of South Bend” has amassed nearly 400,000 Twitter followers.

At first, Chasten mostly stood to the side as his husband gave speeches and worked the crowds. Not anymore. In recent months, the 30-year-old has hosted numerous solo campaign events, usually fundraisers that command anywhere between $25 and $1,000 per ticket. His Twitter account alternates between inspirational messages, references to their dogs, tributes to Buttigieg and gentle teasing of his husband.

Whatever they felt when their son came out, the Glezman parents have since embraced Chasten as well as Buttigieg. In his memoir, the mayor describes how Terry Glezman leveled the parking lot of their wedding venue the night before the ceremony; the next day, both parents walked Chasten down the aisle.

The Buttigieg campaign noted Chasten’s parents have attended several campaign events. At a recent meet-and-greet in their hometown, when Chasten broke down recalling the struggles of coming out, Sherri Glezman discreetly stepped onstage with a tissue.

“My parents are incredible, because they’ve always tried to hold this family together,” Chasten told The Post in April. “They just want everyone to be happy. . . . I think my mom wants nothing more than for all of us to sit around the table again. And it breaks her heart, and it breaks my heart for her, that she will never have that.”

On a Saturday in late June, Chasten held court at the Traverse City pride festival, an event that didn’t exist when he was in high school. Behind him, colorful balloons spelled out “PRIDE.” In front of him stood 5,000 exuberant festival-goers, including his parents.

Chasten told the crowd they had made it. They had survived the closet and the ridicule and would no longer tolerate anyone who made them feel lesser.

“You’re here. You are perfect just the way you are in this space,” Chasten said. “Love is love, and that is enough.”

It felt good, Chasten told everyone, to be home."

Buttigieg is leading the field in the Iowa caucuses in the latest Monmouth University poll. He has 22 percent of the vote, with former vice president Joe Biden (19 percent), Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18 percent) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (13 percent) behind him. Klobuchar has 5 percent.

That’s better than Buttigieg is performing nationally. In the most recent Washington Post/ABC poll, he’s at 9 percent. But that’s still better than Klobuchar (2 percent).

On Sunday, the senator expounded upon her earlier comments in a CNN interview.

“The last point I made in that article was that of the women on the stage — I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators — Senator Harris, Senator Warren and myself,” Klobuchar said on CNN. “Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t. Maybe we’re held to a different standard.”

Some people wrongly accused Klobuchar of suggesting that Buttigieg was not experienced enough to be a top-tier presidential candidate — or perhaps to even run for office. The day of Klobuchar’s interview, VoteVets, a liberal nonprofit focusing on veterans issues, used its Twitter account to push back on the idea that Buttigieg doesn’t have experience.

We've heard people say @PeteButtigieg doesn't have experience. Those who served in war have real world experience & perspective relatively few others in America have.#VeteransDay is good time for those people to apologize to Pete, and all vets, for minimizing their experience. — VoteVets (@votevets) November 11, 2019

But that is not what the lawmaker said. When host Jake Tapper asked Klobuchar whether she thought Buttigieg was “qualified period,” she answered “yes.”

Other prominent Democratic women backed up Klobuchar’s belief that a woman whose most significant public office experience was being a mayor of a town of 100,000 would never be in the running to be the Democratic Party’s nominee for president of the United States.

Patti Solis Doyle, who worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, said Klobuchar was “absolutely 100 percent right on this one.”

“It’s no secret that sexism plays a role in politics and government. It’s no secret that women have to work twice as hard, be twice as good, to get half the credit,” she said on CNN on Monday. “It’s why we’ve never elected a female president.”

Buttigieg acknowledged that women were at a disadvantage last month when he told CNN that sexism in politics is hurting female candidates.

“Sexism is a real force in politics right now,” he said. “I think it would be naive for me to say that that hasn’t played some role to the disadvantage of female candidates and to the advantage of male candidates” like him.

AD

Klobuchar’s statement actually invokes controversial ideas about electability — the often vague concept about who has the skills, traits and characteristics needed to defeat President Trump in the upcoming election. According to a September Washington Post-ABC News poll, just 7 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independents said that a woman would be more likely to defeat Trump in 2020. Another 23 percent said a man would be more likely to beat Trump, and a 69 percent majority said it didn’t matter.

AD

This argument that people are backing Buttigieg who would not back a woman with a similar résumé is a difficult one for a female candidate to make without harming herself in the process. Some supporters of Buttigieg will hear Klobuchar calling them sexist. Whether it will move those voters to reconsider Klobuchar’s candidacy is another thing. But this might have been a risk worth taking for Klobuchar, a candidate who can’t drop much further in the polls, and perhaps as a result enjoys the freedom that can come with not having much to lose.

AD

What could be more interesting to watch in that framing is whether Warren runs with it at any point. Warren has said she’s experienced some sexism in her presidential race and praised Buttigieg for acknowledging in the past that he is enjoying some advantages because he is a man.

When asked whether she agreed with Klobuchar comments on Pete, @ewarren said “@PeteButtigieg said that’s the case, he agreed with Sen. Klobuchar and I appreciate his recognizing that he gets a certain advantage by being male. That’s what he said.” — Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou (@misyrlena) November 11, 2019

Despite their experience, there are actually reasons that some voters could prefer Buttigieg over the other women — and particularly Klobuchar — that aren’t because of sexism. Interrogating those things could be instrumental in Klobuchar and her opponents discovering why they aren’t doing as well with voters as Buttigieg. But the mayor more or less backing up the lawmaker’s point could also challenge some of his supporters to ask themselves if they would be as supportive of Buttigieg if he didn’t remind them of JFK or Obama, but were a woman instead.

It shows a three-person race, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg joining Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden at the top of the field. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) trails just behind.

It’s a big change for Buttigieg who, in Monmouth’s August poll, was under 10 percent. He’s improved by 14 points, ignoring the role of margins of error for the moment.

That’s going to be the focal point of a lot of coverage of the new poll, and understandably so. But the snapshot we were handed was something like a picture of a crowded field on the stretch turn, a number of horses, any of which have some shot at crossing the line first. Buttigieg joined the pack, but it remains to be seen whether he can keep running with them.

One indicator that he can is that he’s the combined first or second choice of 37 percent of likely caucusgoers. That’s about where Warren is, at 35 percent. Warren’s position on that metric has held steady since August, when she was the first or second choice of 38 percent of Iowans. Biden dropped from 38 percent, then to 29 percent now.

It’s important to remember, too, that this isn’t a normal race. It’s not simply that each candidate is racing to cross the finish line and the person with the most support earns the delegates. Instead, the Iowa caucuses use a threshold underneath which support gets redistributed. That’s where the second-choice question becomes particularly significant: If Sanders doesn’t get 15 percent support at a caucus site, for example, his supporters have to go to another candidate. Being the most popular second choice means more in Iowa than it does elsewhere.

AD

AD

That system does admittedly break our horse-race analogy.

What’s particularly notable in Monmouth’s poll is the factor highlighted by the pollsters themselves, who published their results under the headline, “Few Caucusgoers Tied to 2020 Choice.” The race is very fluid, and a lot of people indicate that they’re willing to change their minds.

Specifically, only about a third of respondents say that they’re firmly committed to a candidate or that there’s only a low possibility they’ll change their minds. About half say they’re more flexible. That sort of flexibility is what leads to 14-point jumps in the polls.

(It’s worth noting that Buttigieg, in addition to earning the most support, was the candidate most likely to be identified as someone voters had seen in person. A third of respondents said they’d seen a candidate in person. Seventeen percent said they had seen Buttigieg. By contrast, 11 percent said they had seen Biden.)

Buttigieg also probably benefits from not being the target of much negative attention from his opponents. His net favorability (those who view him favorably minus those who don’t) remained high since August. Biden and Warren both saw their net favorabilities drop. In Warren’s case, that’s probably partly a function of how much fire she took at the most recent Democratic debate, itself a function of her surge in the polls.

This, too, doesn’t translate well to our horse-race analogy. The horse in the lead is … the target of people throwing rotten fruit or something? As they race to a finish line at which point the trailing horses have to join the leading horses’ teams? Is that right?

AD

AD

The Monmouth poll also undercuts that analogy in the most direct way. At any given moment, the position of half the horses in the field could just suddenly change dramatically. It’s like a horse race with changing rules taking place on a flood plain during a monsoon. A snapshot of what’s happening is by no means useless, but it takes about six minutes of explanation before you can understand what you might be looking at.

LGBT activist Charlotte Clymer argued that Castro is correct and that a state that better reflects the diversity of America should go precede Iowa.

Activists in the Democratic base have long argued for a change in the primary system. Candidates often determine whether they will keep pursuing the White House, in part, based on their Iowa performance. But that is months before the first primary — South Carolina — that features a significant number of voters of color.

Many Iowans also believe that the current caucus process leaves out some demographics in the state and support changing to a primary system that could lead to greater diversity among participants. According to a new Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll, 44 percent of Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers said it is more important for Iowa to hold a primary “so everyone can vote, even if it means Iowa would no longer” be first.

Some argue that the current caucus system — a long process that happens at night — often excludes people with disabilities, elderly people, working-class voters who work at nights and single parents with child-care needs.

But the argument for keeping Iowa first is that the voters are deeply engaged and accessible. Campaigns without much money or manpower get to take advantage of Iowa’s grass-roots culture to make their case to Americans who are deeply invested in the election.

David Redlawsk, co-author of “Why Iowa? How Caucuses and Sequential Elections Improve the Presidential Nominating Process,” previously told The Fix during the last presidential election: “Iowa may not be perfectly representative [of the United States], but no one state is.”

The political science professor added: “It actually makes more sense in a sequential system not to worry about the ‘representativeness’ of any one state. Combined, the first four carve-out states — Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — do a pretty good job of representing the constituencies and issues that drive American politics.”

“Are they representative historically and practically — based on race and creed and color — of the nation? No, they’re not,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t play a major part.”

When asked if the order of the primaries should change, Biden replied, “No” — even though he ended his 2008 presidential bid after a poor Iowa performance.

“They are first. That’s what they are now. It’s not going to change,” he said. “It is what it is.”

But the idea that something should be because it has always been may not continue to be a winning argument for members of a Democratic base who are increasingly concerned that they aren’t as valued as they should be, especially since people of color make up a growing percentage of the Democratic Party and the left.

Although Castro is not faring much better with people of color than he is performing overall, concerns that a candidate could move forward without significant support from people of color could become more widespread. If members of the base continue to feel ignored or taken for granted, pushback against the status quo will likely intensify until some change is made.

Tom Steyer files to be placed on the New Hampshire primary ballot at the statehouse in Concord, N.H., on Tuesday. (Elise Amendola/AP)

It was the first question Tom Steyer got after officially filing as a candidate in New Hampshire’s presidential primary. It was the question he always got: How was a billionaire, mostly bankrolling his own campaign, going to inspire Democrats to vote for him?

“I think that what every Democratic voter is looking for is for someone to tell the truth,” Steyer said. “I’ve spent 10 years thinking about what the truth is.”

It was a cryptic answer, but it made sense for Steyer. Like Mike Bloomberg, if he decides to run, Steyer is able to fund a large-scale presidential campaign without worrying about where the money will come from. Both men have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on down-ballot candidates and causes, winning them allies from the gun control movement to the House Democratic conference. While Bloomberg is perhaps 50 times wealthier than Steyer, both of them have enough money to say and do whatever they want and invite frustrated, pragmatic Democrats to come along.

But Steyer’s campaign so far has demonstrated the limits of hacking the Democratic Party and its primary. Bloomberg adeptly did that to New York’s desperate Republican Party two decades ago, with his quick transition from business to politics. Steyer has spent at least $47 million — that number does not include the past six weeks of hire and TV buys — for single-digit polls, small crowds of voters and minor scandals in two early-voting states. When Steyer spoke at this month’s Liberty and Justice Celebration in Des Moines, sandwiched between Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the lack of a cheering section was noticeable.

“I haven’t seen them at events,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chairman in Polk County, Iowa, of Steyer’s five-month campaign there. “I haven’t seen them as much at the phone banking. They’ve been a lot less visible.”

If Bloomberg does run for president — he was filing in person for the Arkansas ballot Tuesday but hasn't officially announced a bid — it will be with a different focus from Steyer, who has turned his lack of elected experience into familiar “Washington is broken” messaging. Unlike Bloomberg, who has won office as only a Republican and given to multiple Republican campaigns, Steyer entered the race with Democratic bona fides and a brand built by countless “Need to Impeach” TV ads.

It got him into the conversation, at some cost. Steyer’s campaign, according to people who had been offered jobs in early states, has floated higher salaries and better benefits than anything else in the field. A national communications role was pegged at $150,000, about 25 percent higher than comparable positions with other Democrats. Organizing roles in the Iowa campaign paid $4,500 to $5,000 per month and came with “wellness benefits,” such as gym membership and student debt forgiveness.

“The workplace policies that we have put in place are meant to attract top talent and catch up with campaigns that have already hired hundreds of staff,” said Steyer spokesman Ben Gerdes. “We pay our staff a living wage and want to ensure that all people can afford to work on this campaign.”

With less than three months to go before the caucuses, this has been enough to organize an Iowa campaign while running behind the campaigns that built more organically. Ten days ago, as former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke's campaign shuttered, some top staff were approached about roles with Steyer and a chance to leave a sunken ship for a well-stocked one. While the campaign has “added staff from congressman O'Rourke's campaign in Iowa,” according to Gerdes, top staffers rebuffed them, with some returning to consulting work and some going on vacation. The appeal of a Texan driving himself from town hall to town hall did not transfer to a wealthy candidate promising to spend big and then take money out of politics.

There were some challenges money couldn't fix and some it could create. The biggest blows to Steyer's campaign came this month: first, when his deputy South Carolina director Dwayne Sims stole data belonging to Kamala D. Harris's campaign, then when his Iowa adviser Pat Murphy offered campaign donations to legislators if they would endorse Steyer. The campaign forced out both Sims and Murphy.

“He resigned,” Steyer said Tuesday, when asked whether Murphy's scandal might make it harder for legislators to support Steyer. “Nothing bad happened. I feel like that's what an organization does. I've been running organizations now for 34 years, and I feel that you have to have standards and live up to those standards.”

Any campaign starting now would have even fewer available staffers than Steyer did when he launched his campaign this summer. Bloomberg, who like Steyer had flirted with a presidential bid, ruled it out and reconsidered, had a strong initial idea of who would staff his campaign in early states. Nine months later, political talent has scattered.

“The best-case scenario is that they find the old Beto people, which would be tough,"" said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democratic strategist who is not aligned with any campaign. ""Five days out, you don’t want to be telling people how to pronounce 'Madrid' or 'Nevada.'"" (It’s MAY-drid and Nuh-VAY-duh, in Iowa.)

Bloomberg’s allies suggest that they wouldn't have to worry about that — not in Iowa. To the immediate fury of the early-state Democratic chairs, Bloomberg’s team suggested he could skip organizing in February and focus on Super Tuesday and the states voting afterward. Instead of lobbying for every vote in Iowa, the mayor could introduce himself to the voters of California, Minnesota, Texas and so on with an ad blitz, the sort of candidate interaction that they’re used to. And doing so did not require a grass-roots campaign.

“I'm going to finance the campaign, if there is one, with my own money so I don't owe anybody anything,” Bloomberg told reporters after filing in Arkansas. “Other people ask for donations, in return for which they've got to give favors. But it costs a lot of money, whether you're doing it with your own money or somebody else's money, to get a message out.”

That’s the angle Steyer has been using for months, to mixed results. In Concord, he talked up how successful NextGen, his young voter outreach campaign, had been in New Hampshire; Bloomberg had been tremendously successful in funding organizations such as Moms Demand Action and ads for Democrats in 2018. Asked on Tuesday how much more money he might spend, Steyer had another cryptic answer.

“Campaigns are wild animals,” he said. “You’re not sure where they’re going to twist and where they’re going to turn.”

ON THE TRAIL

On Sept. 8, former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford began his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, telling Fox News's Chris Wallace that “we need to have a conversation about what it means to be a Republican.” On Tuesday, that conversation came to an end, as Sanford, arriving at New Hampshire's state house, announced that he would not even bother filing for the February primary.

“All of the oxygen is leaving the room, in terms of meaningful debate, on what comes next in our country on a whole host of issues,” Sanford said. “You cannot have a meaningful debate on what we do about the debt and deficit.”

It was a surprise — not because Sanford was in a winning position but because he had seemed ready for a quixotic Republican rescue mission. Just 59 years old, campaigning on a tight budget, Sanford spent nearly as much time talking to Republican operatives about a run as he spent running as an actual primary candidate.

But nobody seemed to pay attention. Last month, Sanford participated in a friendly debate with the two other Republicans challenging Trump, former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld. He was largely left out of the coverage, with his rivals delivering more memorable zingers about the president. He intended to drive the conversation toward his issues with a national tour of events about the debt. Few people showed up. A speech outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall drew no voters and just one reporter, to whom Sanford seemed ready to concede.

“If there’s an appetite in terms of people’s concerns on the financial realities of our country and the way in which we are at a tipping point, then there’s going to be some level of measure and movement with regard to the campaign,” Sanford told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “And if there’s not, there won’t be. And it will be short-lived.”

The indignities came one after the other, often from Sanford's own party. South Carolina Republicans canceled their primary, which drew a lawsuit from anti-Trump Republicans on behalf of Sanford, Weld and Walsh. Minnesota Republicans submitted their primary ballot, months ahead of the deadline, with just one presidential candidate: Trump.

“I don't think we want to get our cues on electoral participation from North Korea,” Sanford said in Concord.

Nothing, least of all the campaigning, could turn the conversation to the national debt. It hit $23 trillion while Sanford was a candidate, with government spending far outpacing revenue, in part because of a tax cut that Sanford supported. In Concord, Sanford held up a mock U.S. Treasury check for $1 trillion, made out to generations of “future years.” Current spending levels are leaving the country in an “unsettling spot” financially, he said, calling sweeping social programs from Democratic candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts akin to “financial malpractice.”

Until Sanford quit the race, New Hampshire's libertarian-leaning Republicans looked like a potential constituency for him. Shortly after the Concord announcement, a town councilor from the nearby town of Merrimack, Bill Boyd, approached Sanford to thank him for addressing the issue and lament that his campaign hadn't caught on.

Sanford walked on, into the State House Visitors Center, where he inspected a wall of campaign bumper stickers stretching back into the decades. A Sanford aide added one of his mock “trillion-dollar bills” to the collection. Nearby was a life-size cardboard cutout of Trump, flashing a grin and a thumbs-up.

The director of the visitor center, Virginia Drew, let out a sigh when Sanford told her he was withdrawing.

“It starts here,” she said, referring to New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, “and it ends here.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Tom Steyer, “Democracy Agenda.” This kitchen-sink spot, running in national markets, sums up Steyer's total agenda: citizen referendums and term limits to unclog the pipes of government. ""I don't think we can fix our democracy from the inside,"" Steyer says. ""I don't think Washington politicians or big corporations will let that happen.""

Bernie Sanders, “Belongs to Us.” The senator from Vermont's latest Iowa spot is interesting for whom it pegs as villains (Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, makes an appearance) and how it phrases his priorities: to “expand Social Security and guarantee health care for all.” Sanders, who wrote the Senate Medicare-for-all legislation and has made it the focus of campaign events, has used the “Medicare-for-all” term in his paid media less than Andrew Yang, who does not support the legislation in full. A previous Sanders ad in Iowa referred to “guaranteed health care for all.”

Joe Biden, “Moment.” The latest of Biden's Iowa spots focuses on foreign policy, for the first time pitching his “strong, steady, stable leadership” as an antidote to President Trump. It touches on a common topic with Democratic voters: a worry about how long it could take to restore stability after the Trump years. But it does not focus on any particular Trump foreign policy failure.

POLL WATCH

Iowa caucuses (Monmouth, 451 Iowa Democrats)

Pete Buttigieg — 22% ( 14)

Joe Biden — 19% (-7)

Elizabeth Warren — 18% (-2)

Bernie Sanders — 13% ( 5)

Amy Klobuchar — 5% ( 2)

Kamala D. Harris — 3% (-9)

Tom Steyer — 3% (-)

Andrew Yang — 3% ( 2)

Cory Booker — 2% ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 2% ( 1)

Steve Bullock — 1% (-)

Julián Castro — 1% ( 1)

The first poll to show Buttigieg in the lead is the umpteenth poll to find, essentially, an Iowa deadlock: Sanders doing a bit better as voters view him more favorably, but Buttigieg, Biden and Warren are in a close fight for the lead. Buttigieg's own favorable rating is unchanged since August, but after a month-long dogpile by other candidates, Warren has experienced her first drop in favorables; more than 20 percent of Iowa Democrats view her unfavorably, for the first time. But she remains better liked, and a more popular second-choice candidate, than Biden, who has dropped in this poll all year and for the first time does not lead it.

The rest of the results demonstrate just how much Iowa Democrats have begun to focus on a few top choices. The number of Iowa Democrats who have “no opinion” of Harris, Booker and Steyer has increased, as they've fallen out of the conversation. Weeks of ad buys have done nothing to move Michael F. Bennet's numbers. By a 31-point margin, Iowa Democrats view Michael Bloomberg unfavorably, with Monmouth finding next to no interest for his campaign. And this poll probably freezes the debate stage at 10, with Castro and Bullock running out of time to qualify for November's event in Atlanta.

Would you consider voting for Michael Bloomberg? (Quinnipiac, 1,134 New Hampshire likely voters)

Definitely not — 54%

Consider it — 37%

Definitely would — 2%

As of Tuesday, it's unclear whether Bloomberg will really run for president or not; it's unclear whether he will file in the first primary state, where the deadline to make the ballot is Friday. But the first poll taken since he began flirting with a run again is ominous, with firm support for a Bloomberg candidacy starting at 2 percent. A majority or plurality of voters, in every demographic and political affiliation, rule out a vote for Bloomberg. The only exceptions are “somewhat liberal” voters, 50 percent of whom would definitely support the former mayor or consider it. Of the current Democratic candidates, Joe Biden loses the most support to a hypothetical Bloomberg run, but it's negligible. The fundamental problem is the one seen in the same poll's horse race numbers, which find Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent: The independents who are inclined to cross over into the Democratic primary are more anti-politics-as-usual than pro-centrism.

Louisiana governor (Mason-Dixon, 625 registered voters)

John Bel Edwards (D) — 48%

Eddie Rispone (R) — 46%

The last election of 2019 is happening in four days, with one more presidential rally coming before the polls close. Rispone, who secured a runoff spot by dominating the airwaves with ads, has not grabbed control of the runoff; Edwards slashed at him in their single televised debate, and African American turnout has been up relative to last month's primary. But this poll, probably the only one we'll get before Saturday, lines up with Democrats' internal polling: a single-digit lead for Edwards, who is popular but running up against an increasingly Republican electorate.

IN THE STATES

California. Former Republican congressman Steve Knight is running again in the 25th Congressional District, which he lost by nine points to Katie Hill. The one-time Democratic phenom resigned after accusations of inappropriate relationship with staff and the release of “revenge porn” photographs; the election to replace her hasn't been set. But Knight is unlikely to clear the field, joining GOP recruit Mike Garcia (who raised $481,013 before Hill's resignation) and local Republican city councilor Angela Underwood Jacobs, who began running before the seat opened up again. State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who represents much of the Los Angeles-area seat, has dominated the Democratic field in endorsements so far.

Kentucky. The Democratic primary for next year's Senate race got another Democrat: state legislator Charles Booker. He's the first Democrat to enter the race since Amy McGrath, a female veteran and 2018 congressional candidate well-liked by national party leaders, raised $10.7 million in her first quarter, far outpacing any other Senate candidate in the country. But where McGrath has been criticized for taking moderate stances (such as a bungled answer on whether she'd have voted for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh), Booker is pitching himself as a liberal and supporter of the Green New Deal.

Mississippi. Mike Espy officially entered the state's 2020 Senate race, one year after narrowly losing a special election for the seat to Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith — and one week after Democrats lost the state's race for governor, which had looked winnable this summer for Attorney General Jim Hood.

“We tried to help Jim Hood,” Espy said in an interview. “We did as much as Jim Hood asked me to do. But Jim Hood would be the first to tell you that there wasn't a lot of energy around that race, and there wasn't enough done to get out the black vote. Coming up in 2020, I don't think that's going to be an issue.”

Espy, who had largely retired from politics before his 2018 run, said he was hurt by lower turnout and by the short time frame he had for campaigning.

“We had enough money, but not enough time to deploy the money,” Espy said. “I had to stand up and campaign alone, because the Mississippi Democratic Party wasn't strong like it should have been. But the enthusiasm was palpable in 2018, and this time we need it to be off the charts.”

Espy said that pushing black turnout slightly higher and holding onto gains with white voters would get his candidacy to 50 percent of the vote; he'd won 46.4 percent in his bid against Hyde-Smith. And he distanced himself from his party's more left-wing voices.

“I'm not for Medicare-for-all,” he said. “I believe that if you have your own health insurance, you ought to be able to keep it. I don't want a single-payer system. I'm not for open borders on immigration. I'm an independent, moderate Democrat, and I've always been that way.”

2020

What does a multimillionaire coal magnate do after a self-funded Senate bid falls through? He runs for president. Don Blankenship, whose 2018 candidacy in West Virginia startled Republicans into spending money against him, is now seeking the conservative Constitution Party's presidential nomination.

“Don will be attempting to be the first person ever to become an occupant of the White House after having been in the 'big house,' "" his campaign announced. (Blankenship served a year in prison after a 2015 misdemeanor conviction over the violation of federal mine-safety standards.) ""In response to the Mitch McConnell-led smear campaign Don has an active defamation lawsuit against the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), numerous media outlets and Donald Trump, Jr."" The Post is among the media defendants Blankenship has sued.

The Constitution Party, which grew out of the old U.S. Taxpayers Party, has never become a real player in presidential politics. In 2008, the party's Montana affiliate gave its ballot line to Ron Paul; it has otherwise nominated conservative activists with small or nonexistent national profiles. A perennial problem has been how to make the case against the Republican Party without enabling a Democratic victory, something Blankenship has been puzzling over.

“I see a country that does not have a plan to get better or to make the country be great again,” Blankenship told The Post. “I am still supportive of the president’s policies, and generally I am supporting the president.”

Blankenship spent more than $2 million of his own money on the 2018 Senate run, and his net worth is estimated in the tens of millions, less than billionaire Tom Steyer has spent on his Democratic primary campaign.

Tulsi Gabbard. Through an unnamed legal counsel, Gabbard demanded that Hillary Clinton apologize for the remarks she made Oct. 17, in which she claimed the Hawaiian was being “groomed” for a third-party candidacy. Clinton's quote referred to Republicans sounding out Gabbard for a run, but her spokesman did not deny that she was talking about Russians; Gabbard and allies have said the 2016 Democratic nominee was smearing her as a traitor.

Gabbard's demands now include that Clinton hold a news conference (which would be her first in three years) and issue this statement: “On October 17, 2019, I made certain statements about Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Among other things, I accused her of being a Russian asset and that Russia was grooming her to be a third-party presidential candidate. I was wrong. I never should have made these remarks, and I apologize. I did not have any basis for making the statements. I acknowledge my grave mistake and error in judgment in this matter. I support and admire the work that Congresswoman Gabbard has done and will continue to do in serving our country.”

Bernie Sanders. He secured the endorsement of National Nurses United, a union that had provided millions of dollars in support for his 2016 campaign. Only three candidates submitted themselves for sit-down interviews with the union: Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. ""We were fortunate to have candidates to choose from this time,"" said Jean Ross, the union's co-president. ""In 2016, there was one candidate who backs our issues. This was more difficult.""

Joe Biden. He published a list of 133 endorsements from diplomats and military leaders, part of a post-Veterans Day campaign push on his experience and credibility as a commander in chief.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

The latest Democratic argument started with a dodge. Over the weekend, at a lightly attended environmental justice forum in South Carolina, Democracy Now host Amy Goodman asked Elizabeth Warren whether the order of the primaries was unfairly biased against nonwhite voters.

“Are you actually going to ask me to sit here and criticize Iowa and New Hampshire?” Warren asked.

“They’re two of the whitest states in the country,” Goodman explained, “and then we move to South Carolina with a very significant population of people of color, and it means the candidates spend so much of their time catering to those first two states. Overall, do you think that should change?”

Warren didn't bite. “Look, I’m just a player in the game on this one,” she said. “And I am delighted to be in South Carolina.”

Other candidates had given similar answers to the question, which is both direct and full of risks. The timing of Goodman's question added some drama; some who watched it, unaware that it was the final question at a largely policy-focused forum, speculated that Warren had lost her cool and cut the interview short. Since then, most Democrats have given the same answer as Warren, while Julián Castro has come out against the standard (since 2008) primary order.

“I actually do believe that we need to change the order of the states because I don’t believe that we’re the same country we were in 1972 — that is when Iowa first held its caucus first,” Castro said. “Demographically, it’s not reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party, and I believe that other states should have their chance. … We can't say to black women, 'Oh thank you, you are the ones empowering our victories,' and then turn around and start our nominating contests in two states that have barely any black people in them.”

Castro said this in Iowa, shortly after downsizing his campaign in New Hampshire and South Carolina. He has repeatedly criticized the DNC's debate rules, which are likely to boot him from the stage this month, because they depend on polling from early states, and Nevada — the only February state with a significant Latino population — has hardly been polled at all. (Castro came in at 1 percent in the most recent state poll, conducted for the Nevada Independent.)

Still, he was the only candidate to dig in on a perennial, awkward topic, one that had actually stayed beneath the surface for much of this year. The first two states, which winnow down the primary field and get the vast majority of candidate attention, are overwhelmingly white. The party is not. While issues that primarily affect Latino, black and Asian American issues have been debated throughout the campaign, they're not determinative in Iowa or New Hampshire.

Why hadn't this debate broken out before? Part of the reason was the 2016 election, which swept Democrats out of power thanks to heavy losses in the Midwest. Iowa, overnight, transformed from yet another mostly white state, to a state with a story to tell: Nearly one-third of its 99 counties had voted for Barack Obama, then for Donald Trump. The Democratic panic about “electability” was in large part a panic about white voters without college degrees, and Iowa was suddenly a place to prove a candidate's appeal to those voters.

Another reason: the general Democratic awareness that no candidate could win with white primary voters alone. Joe Biden had been the most blunt about it, with his campaign emphasizing the candidate's diverse support by way of explaining how he could absorb losses in the first two primaries. The primary's two black candidates, Kamala D. Harris and Cory Booker, worked to evoke memories of 2008: A win in Iowa, proving a black candidate's appeal to white voters, could move black voters' minds.

Why has the debate broken out now? A big reason is Pete Buttigieg, who, unlike the other high-polling white candidates, has negligible support so far with nonwhite voters. Castro, who in the past few weeks has been especially scabrous about the 37-year-old Hoosier's rise, was making a point about how dazzled Iowans might be on track to elevate a candidate whom nonwhite voters view skeptically, if they think of him at all.

THE BIG IDEA: When Donald Trump appeared on Steve Bannon’s radio show in December 2015, the then-Breitbart host asked his future boss how he’d approach Turkey if elected president.

“I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” Trump replied. “It’s called Trump Towers — two towers, instead of one. … And I’ve gotten to know Turkey very well. They’re amazing people. They’re incredible people. They have a strong leader.”

That “little conflict of interest” remains, and that “strong leader” is coming to the White House this afternoon.

President Trump is rolling out the red carpet for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan just weeks after his military incursion into northern Syria. By law, Trump is required to impose sanctions against Turkey for buying a Russian missile defense system. Before Erdogan took delivery in July, senior administration officials said it would be unacceptable and compromise the stealth capabilities of the new generation F-35 combat jet. But Trump has delayed sanctions and asked GOP senators for flexibility.

-- The president’s softness toward Turkey and his bromance with Erdogan is striking and, to some former Trump aides, suspicious. To wit: Former national security adviser John Bolton suggested during a private speech in Miami last week that the president’s approach to U.S. policy on Turkey is motivated by personal or financial interests, six people who were present for the remarks told NBC News.

“Bolton told the gathering of Morgan Stanley’s largest hedge fund clients that he was most frustrated with Trump over his handling of Turkey,” Stephanie Ruhle and Carol Lee report. “Noting the broad bipartisan support in Congress to sanction Turkey after [Erdogan] purchased a Russian missile defense system, Bolton said Trump’s resistance to the move was unreasonable … Bolton said he believes there is a personal or business relationship dictating Trump’s position on Turkey because none of his advisers are aligned with him on the issue.”

-- Erdogan, then prime minister, cut the ribbon at the opening of Trump Towers Istanbul in 2012. Trump was there with his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Both now work in the White House. The Trump Organization, which the president has never divested from, has received annual licensing fees for the use of the name on the skyscrapers.

-- Trump has offered Erdogan a package of inducements to improve U.S.-Turkey relations, which will be up for discussion today, that is virtually identical to those the administration proposed last month in a failed effort to stop Turkey’s invasion of Syria. Karen DeYoung, Missy Ryan and Kareem Fahim report on the proposal: “In a new letter to Erdogan last week, Trump told the Turkish president that a $100 billion trade deal, and a workaround to avoid U.S. sanctions over Turkey’s purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system, are still possible, senior administration officials said. The offer is likely to infuriate at least some of the overwhelming House majority that voted last month to impose sanctions on Turkey over its assault into Syria, and a bipartisan group of senators who introduced a similar bill. …

“In exchange for Trump’s revived offer, Erdogan would continue what the administration has said is its adherence to an Oct. 17 cease-fire agreement, negotiated with Vice President Pence a week after the invasion began, that limited the Turkish incursion. [There is dispute about the degree to which Erdogan has complied.] Turkey, a NATO [member], would also continue to actively support U.S. goals of preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State in Syria and establishing a stable and representative Syrian government. … Now, the administration’s red line is that the S-400s ‘do not become operational’ in a way that would allow them ‘access to our F-35 communications and defenses,’ said the senior official.”

-- Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army, a Turkish proxy force, has been accused of widespread abuses, including summary executions, beatings, kidnappings and looting in areas under Turkey’s control. “U.S. military officials watched live drone feeds in October that appeared to show Turkish-backed Arab gunmen targeting civilians during their assault on Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria, attacks the Americans reported to their commanders as possible war crimes,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. “U.S. surveillance videos of two incidents were included in an internal report compiled by State Department officials laying out concerns regarding four credible cases of alleged war crimes…”

After saying he wouldn’t tolerate such behavior, Erdogan has not cracked down on these Turkish-backed forces. In fact, he’s defended them. Margaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, has more about the ground truth in an op-ed for today’s paper: “As Erdogan visits the White House, remember the suffering in northern Syria.”

-- When the Turks want something from Trump, they go to Jared: “Behind President Trump’s accommodating attitude toward Turkey is an unusual back channel: a trio of sons-in-law who married into power and now play key roles in connecting Ankara with Washington,” the New York Times reports in a deep dive on the nexus of political and business interests. “One, Turkey’s finance minister, is the son-in-law of its strongman president and oversees his country’s relationship with the United States. Another is the son-in-law of a Turkish tycoon and became a business partner to the Trump Organization. Now he advocates for Turkey with the Trump administration. And the third is Jared Kushner, who as the son-in-law of and senior adviser to Mr. Trump has a vague if expansive foreign policy portfolio. Operating both individually and in tandem, the three men have developed an informal, next-generation line of communication…

“Mr. Erdogan predicted in a television interview this year that a private dialogue between Berat Albayrak, his [41-year-old] son-in-law and finance minister, and Mr. Kushner would soon put ‘back on track’ the vexed relations … ‘The bridge works well in this manner,’ Mr. Erdogan said. ‘Backdoor diplomacy,’ Mr. Albayrak called his work with Mr. Kushner. … On the Russian missiles, banking sanctions and other matters, Mr. Erdogan has deployed both his own son-in-law and Mr. Trump’s Turkish business partner, Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, as emissaries to the administration, sometimes through Mr. Kushner … In April, for example, Mr. Albayrak had come to Washington for a conference organized by Mr. Yalcindag at the Trump International Hotel. And in the middle of the event, Mr. Kushner summoned Mr. Albayrak to an impromptu meeting in the Oval Office, where Mr. Albayrak successfully pressed Mr. Trump to hold back the sanctions against Turkey for buying Russian weapons. …

“On the strength of his ties to the Trump family, Mr. Erdogan also named Mr. Yalcindag to a new role as chairman of a state-run business group that lobbies Washington on behalf of Ankara. The group’s previous chairman, Ekim Alptekin, had run afoul of American prosecutors by paying more than $500,000 to the consulting firm of the retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who went on to become Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser. … Taking over as the face of the state-sponsored Turkey-U.S. Business Council after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Yalcindag began to travel regularly to Washington. The council for the first time held its annual conferences at the Trump hotel in Washington, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue for the hotel while pulling in top Trump administration officials as speakers.”

-- In a sentencing memo last December, former special counsel Bob Mueller’s team of prosecutors outlined more of the secretive activities Flynn undertook to help Turkey while advising the Trump campaign in 2016.

-- Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, also has interests in Turkey. Philip Bump explained some of the backstory recently: “Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) thought he was talking to Turkey’s minister of defense [in August]. … It was a Russian radio host who has earned a reputation for getting foreign officials on the phone and eliciting information under false pretenses as he did in two calls with Graham. … In the second conversation, Graham touts his access to Trump by claiming to have spent significant time with the president over the previous weekend in which they discussed Turkey. … ‘This case involving the Turkish bank?’ Graham said. ‘He’s very sensitive. The president wants to be helpful within the limits of his power.’ He mentioned it again a bit later, describing his conversations with Trump during their interactions. …

“It appears to be a reference to a criminal case in the United States focused on a man named Reza Zarrab. Zarrab was at the center of an effort to help Iran evade international sanctions by masking money transfers into the country as sales of gold. After being arrested in the United States in 2016, Zarrab agreed to work with prosecutors, providing testimony against an official from a Turkish state bank, Halkbank. That official was found guilty in January 2018. In late 2017, Zarrab also directly implicated Erdogan, suggesting that the then-prime minister had approved the scheme. Shortly after Zarrab was arrested, Erdogan pressured the Obama administration to release him — and to fire the U.S. attorney who brought charges against Zarrab, Preet Bharara. Trump fired Bharara in March 2017. …

“Zarrab himself has been represented by two attorneys whose names might be familiar to Americans: Michael Mukasey, a former attorney general, and [Giuliani]. The pair even met with Erdogan in early 2017, reportedly to try to resolve the Zarrab case. At some point that year, Trump directly tried to intervene. With Giuliani and Mukasey in the room, Trump reportedly asked then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to try to get the Justice Department to drop the case against Zarrab. The president also suggested he speak with Giuliani about the case. Tillerson refused. … That Graham focused on the ‘case involving the Turkish bank’ — Halkbank — after apparently spending time with Trump at his club in Bedminster in August suggests that the Zarrab affair may still be at the forefront of Trump’s concerns in regard to Turkey. It also suggests another situation where, like Ukraine, Trump may be following Giuliani’s lead.”

-- The run of show: As most of us are watching the first televised impeachment inquiry hearing, Trump is scheduled to welcome Erdogan at the South Portico of the White House at noon. The presidents will be joined for 20 minutes by their wives, and then they will talk for 30 minutes in “a restricted bilateral meeting” in the Oval Office before going to the Cabinet Room for an expanded working lunch. Trump and Erdogan are scheduled to hold a joint news conference at 3:10 p.m. in the East Room, and then Erdogan is set to depart the White House just before 4 p.m.

-- Some prominent liberals are pressing House Democrats to expand the scope of the impeachment inquiry to include Trump Organization dealings overseas, with Turkey near the top of the list. “The Constitution is clear: The founders were deadly afraid foreign governments would get their hooks into high-ranking American officials, especially the president,” said Jeff Hauser, the executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic Policy and Research. “Trump's policies and team have tilted toward Turkey at key junctures over the past three years, and it is Congress’s constitutional responsibility to determine if that's because Trump is as financially entangled with Turkey as Flynn and Giuliani.”

Democratic leaders are eager to wrap up the impeachment process as early as possible in 2020 so they can pivot to pocketbook issues. That’s kept the probe narrowly focused and meant a range of potential Trump misconduct is not being seriously scrutinized. Hauser and other thought leaders on the left warn that this is a mistake. “By shouting that impeachment rests on the Ukraine story alone, House Democrats risk undermining their constitutional responsibilities to safeguard the executive branch from foreign entanglements,” he told me. “The only reliable way to assess Turkey's seeming influence over Trump is for the House to subpoena all relevant Trump Organizational records. The Trump Organization is not ‘the presidency,’ and there is no risk of any remotely serious claim of executive privilege.”

-- Another fresh reminder of the president’s financial entanglements overseas: The Trump Organization has agreed to pay $290,000 to the Scottish government, ending a multiyear legal battle in which Trump tried and failed to block an offshore wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses. “The agreement to pay the government’s legal fees ends the company’s bitter public dispute with the Scottish government. Over the years, Trump repeatedly criticized former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond about the wind farm and warned that it would cause ‘almost total destruction’ of the country’s tourism industry,” Joshua Partlow reports. “A Scottish government spokesman said that the settlement — first reported by the Scotsman newspaper — removed the need for an independent auditor to determine expenses to be paid by the Trump Organization. … The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.”

Smoke rises today from a suicide bomb blast in Kabul. (Omar Sobhani/Reuters)

-- At least seven people were killed, including five children, and 10 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded near the Kabul airport this morning. Siobhán O’Grady and Sayed Salahuddin report: “The target of the blast appeared to be an armored vehicle belonging to GardaWorld, a Canadian security company, and at least four of the wounded were foreigners … The suicide bombing was the first major attack on the Afghan capital after about a month of relative calm, and it came only one day after President Ashraf Ghani said he would release three high-profile Taliban commanders from prison, a major concession he said he hoped would jump-start talks and lead to the release of hostages, including two foreigners, one American and one Australian, kidnapped by the Taliban in 2016.” (A pedophile ring in Afghanistan may be responsible for the abuse of over 500 boys, the Guardian reports.)

THE LATEST ON THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:

-- Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate who has been indicted for campaign finance violations, says he discussed Ukraine with the president during an exclusive donor dinner in Trump’s Washington hotel. Rosalind S. Helderman, Matt Zapotosky, Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey report: “Parnas, has described to associates that he and his business partner, Igor Fruman, told Trump at the dinner that they thought the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was unfriendly to the president and his interests. According to Parnas, the president reacted strongly to the news: Trump immediately suggested that then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who had been in the Foreign Service for 32 years and served under Democratic and Republican presidents, should be fired, people familiar with his account said. … Parnas’s account of personally discussing Ukraine with Trump more than 18 months ago suggests that he and Fruman had more personal interaction with the president — and potentially more influence over his views on that country — than the White House has acknowledged. … Parnas’s account of the 2018 dinner is the first indication that he or Fruman interacted directly with Trump about Ukraine. His description of their conversation suggests that the Boca Raton businessman, who emigrated as a child from Ukraine, could hold key information about Trump’s pressure campaign on his home country — an effort that set in motion the ongoing impeachment inquiry.”

-- Aides are warning Trump not to fire acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Carol D. Leonnig, Tom Hamburger, Josh Dawsey and John Hudson report: “Senior advisers have cautioned Trump that removing Mulvaney at such a sensitive time could be perilous ... both because Mulvaney played an integral role in the decision to freeze the aid, and because of the disruption that would be caused by replacing one of Trump’s most senior aides. ‘I don’t think you’ll see him going anywhere until after December,’ said one Trump adviser ... ‘But the president was very unhappy with that press conference. That was a very bad day for the president.’ … Mulvaney’s relationship with Trump garnered new scrutiny Tuesday when he called off plans to file a lawsuit asking the courts to rule on whether he should comply with a House subpoena to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Instead he announced he would follow the president’s broad directive barring aides from participating in the inquiry.”­

-- Get to know the lawyers you will see on television today:

The lead Democratic counsel, Daniel S. Goldman, cut his teeth by sending mobsters, stock swindlers and inside traders to prison. Devlin Barrett reports: “At the public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee due to begin Wednesday, Goldman is slotted to question each witness for 45 minutes, followed by five-minute question sessions for each lawmaker. Stephen R. Castor, general counsel for the House Oversight Committee, will be the Republicans’ point man. The format is a significant departure from routine congressional hearings, where lawmakers have the spotlight and seldom cede the microphone and live television coverage to a staffer. By assigning a big chunk of the questioning to a committee lawyer, and in Goldman’s case, an accomplished former prosecutor, party leaders are tacitly acknowledging just how serious the stakes are.”

Castor, the lead Republican staff attorney, has served as an investigator in some of the biggest House probes of the last 15 years, including inquiries related to Hurricane Katrina and the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Elise Viebeck reports: “Castor will help lead the effort as general counsel for the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In contrast with his Democratic counterpart … Castor has spent his career avoiding the media spotlight, rising through the ranks over nearly 15 years and seven consecutive chairmanships to become the Oversight panel’s top GOP lawyer. Castor declined to comment for this report, but a half-dozen former colleagues and bosses praised him as a straight-shooting attorney whose deliberate, low-key style will make him an asset to Republicans...""

-- For Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and today’s first public witness, everything has been easy compared to Vietnam, per a Yahoo profile: “Taylor served in the 101st Airborne’s 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry, and for a year commanded 20 to 30 men in his rifle platoon on the front lines of the conflict, in the Quang Tri and Thua Tien provinces of what was then South Vietnam. … After a year, Taylor was eligible to return home to the U.S. Instead, he signed up to stay another six months, was promoted to captain, and became commander of Alpha Company. … Taylor was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Air Medal. He left the military in 1975 and went on to work in senior positions at the newly created Department of Energy and then on the staff of Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J. In the 1990s, Taylor oversaw U.S. assistance to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the years immediately following the fall of the Iron Curtain. ... Taylor spent a few years working in Afghanistan, Iraq and on the Middle East peace process. In 2006, he returned to Eastern Europe as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.""

-- Taylor published an op-ed in a Ukrainian newspaper reaffirming U.S. support for the country: “The United States is firmly committed to Ukraine’s success – your success is our success. We will not allow Russia to dismantle the international order that was painstakingly built after World War II,"" he wrote earlier this week. ""President [Volodomyr] Zelenskyy’s administration and the Verkhovna Rada have taken solid steps toward meaningful judicial reform, including the reboot of key anti-corruption institutions that give teeth to the rule of law and other fundamental reforms. … But as everyone who promotes democracy knows, strengthening and protecting democratic values is a constant process, requiring persistence and steady work by both officials and ordinary citizens. As in all democracies, including the United States, work remains in Ukraine, especially to strengthen rule of law and to hold accountable those who try to subvert Ukraine’s structures to serve their personal aims, rather than the nation’s interests.”

-- Taylor and George Kent are in the hot seat today. Marie Yovanovitch, the deposed ex-ambassador, comes to the Capitol on Friday. And eight more witnesses are scheduled to testify in public hearings next week. Democrats announced this lineup last night:

Tuesday: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the European affairs director at the National Security Council; Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine; Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to Mike Pence who listened to the July 25 call; and Timothy Morrison, the former senior director for Russian affairs at the NSC.

Wednesday: Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union; Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine; and David Hale, the State Department’s under secretary for political affairs.

Thursday: Fiona Hill, the former top Russia adviser on the NSC.

-- In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Giuliani lays out an impeachment defense for Trump: “The conversation my client … had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 was innocent. ... For Messrs. Trump and Zelensky to discuss these issues was not only proper but an exercise of Mr. Trump’s responsibility as U.S. president as expressed in Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution: ‘to take care that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed.’ Moreover, Mr. Trump requested that Ukraine root out corruption; he didn’t demand it. His words were cordial, agreeable and free of any element of threat or coercion. Mr. Trump offered nothing in return to Ukraine for cleaning up corruption.""

-- Giuliani was negotiating a deal to co-produce a podcast with The Hill and writer John Solomon, a central figure in the disinformation campaign against Joe Biden. From ProPublica: “The project, which never came to fruition for unclear reasons, featured the former New York City mayor interviewing various public figures. The emails include recordings of lengthy chats with the commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, and a retired Marine Corps general named James T. Conway. The Conway interview largely concerned MEK, the dissident Iranian group that the United States had designated a terrorist group until 2012. MEK has paid Giuliani at least $20,000 for appearances and lobbying on its behalf.""

-- History will judge: Even if Senate Republicans don't convict Trump, as expected, the GOP will pay a reputational price for a generation, writes Politico co-founder John F. Harris. “Most Republicans do not face a high cost within their own party for defending Trump. But, in a country becoming younger and more diverse, there’s little chance even these internal GOP politics remain static. The isolationists of the 1930s had the popular position at the time, but had considerable explaining to do for years after. So did the McCarthy backers of the 1950s. So did the civil rights opponents of the 1960s. Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri is 39. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas is 42. There is every reason to suppose they and other ascendant Republicans will be answering ‘what did you do in the Trump years?’ for decades to come.”

ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN:

-- Did Trump perjure himself in his answers to former special counsel Bob Mueller? Roger Stone’s trial has shown that the self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" was the linchpin of a months-long effort by Trump’s 2016 campaign to discover damaging information on Hillary Clinton to be released by WikiLeaks, an effort that began before the hack of Democratic emails was publicly known. Someone is not telling the truth about what the president knew and when he knew it.

“Testimony over four days ending Tuesday also revealed engagement by Trump and top aides in making use of Stone’s claims that he knew emails detrimental to Clinton’s campaign would be released,” Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Matt Zapotosky report. “The trial in federal court in Washington turns on accusations that Stone lied to Congress about his attempts to learn more about what WikiLeaks would publish and when it would do so. But some testimony also raises questions about the president’s written assertions under oath that he did not recall being aware of communications between Stone and WikiLeaks or recall any conversations about WikiLeaks between Stone and members of his campaign.” The White House declined to comment.

“Rick Gates, who served as Trump’s deputy campaign chairman, testified Tuesday that Stone began discussing Clinton leaks with the campaign in April 2016 and that from May onward Gates understood Stone to be the campaign’s intermediary with WikiLeaks. By July 2016, Gates testified, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said he was updating Trump and others regularly and directed Gates to keep following up with Stone. After Trump ended one phone call from Stone at the end of that month, Gates testified, the future president said to Gates that ‘more information would be coming.’ … Gates said Stone also asked for contact information for … Jared Kushner and political director Jim Murphy to brief them on the Democratic emails, which U.S. authorities concluded were hacked by Russia.

“After WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in July that he had more Clinton emails ‘pending publication,’ Gates said Manafort told him to stay in touch with Stone about future releases. Manafort, Gates testified, ‘would be updating other people on the campaign, including the candidate.’ … Despite what Gates said was skepticism about Stone’s reliability, he testified that he and other top campaign staffers, including Manafort, spokesman Jason Miller and adviser Stephen Miller, held ‘brainstorming sessions’ based on what Stone told them.” Closing arguments are scheduled for 1 p.m. today.

-- Trump has considered firing Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community’s inspector general, because he reported the whistleblower’s complaint to Congress after concluding that it was credible. From the Times: “The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal … It is unclear how far Mr. Trump’s discussions about removing Mr. Atkinson have progressed. Two people familiar with what took place said they thought that Mr. Trump was just venting, and insisted that Mr. Atkinson’s dismissal was never under serious consideration. … Inspectors general are supposed to be insulated from politics so they can follow the facts and provide oversight of the executive branch. While presidents have the authority to remove them, they are supposed to take that action only in cases of misconduct or failure to fulfill duties. … People close to the president believe the political consequences of firing Mr. Atkinson could be devastating, especially when Mr. Trump needs all the Republican support he can get for a potential impeachment trial in the Senate.”

-- The Justice Department's inspector general has begun scheduling times for witnesses to review draft sections of his report on the FBI’s investigation of Trump’s 2016 campaign. This is an indication that the document will soon be released publicly. Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report: “Several witnesses have been scheduled or are in talks to review sections of the report dealing with their testimony in the next two weeks, the people said on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. That could mean public release is imminent, though the witnesses will be allowed to submit feedback — which could spark more investigative work and slow down the process. The particulars for each witness’s review were not immediately clear and in some cases were still being negotiated. The inspector general’s office will probably offer relatively short windows for witnesses to submit feedback and take other steps to prevent leaks, as it often does in sensitive and high-profile cases.”

-- Leaked emails from White House senior adviser Stephen Miller show him promoting white nationalism, far-right extremist ideas and anti-immigrant rhetoric, according to a new report released by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Kim Bellaware reports that this is the first installment in a series that draws on more than 900 emails that Miller sent to a Breitbart writer over a 15-month period between 2015 and 2016 and were given to the SPLC: ""The report describes Miller’s emails as overwhelmingly focused on race and immigration and characterizes him as obsessed with ideas such as ‘white genocide’ (a conspiracy theory associated with white supremacists) and sharply curbing nonwhite immigration. … At least one member of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for Miller to resign. … White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said via email that she had not seen the report but called the SPLC ‘an utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization.’ ‘They are beneath public discussion, even in The Washington Post,’ Grisham said of the civil rights nonprofit. …

""SPLC’s report indicates Miller was widely successful in molding the race- and immigration-focused stories that appeared on Breitbart. It repeatedly details how an email from Miller corresponded to a related article later appearing on the site. The emails were provided to the SPLC by Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart writer and editor who exchanged scores of messages with Miller.” Read the full report here.

-- Violent hate crimes reached a 16-year high in 2018, the FBI said. From the Times: “Over all, the number of hate crimes of all kinds reported in the United States remained fairly flat last year after a three-year increase, according to an annual F.B.I. report. But while crimes against property were down, physical assaults against people were up, accounting for 61 percent of the 7,120 incidents classified as hate crimes by law enforcement officials nationwide. … The F.B.I. said there were 4,571 reported hate crimes against people in 2018, many of them in America’s largest cities, involving victims from a wide range of ethnic and religious backgrounds. … Immigration has replaced terrorism as a top concern in the United States, according to national surveys. That shift appears to be reflected in the hate-crime data, which shows fewer attacks against Muslims and Arab-Americans in recent years, but more against Latinos. The F.B.I. said 485 hate crimes against Latinos were reported in 2018, up from 430 in 2017. It said 270 crimes were reported against Muslims and Arab-Americans, the fewest since 2014.”

-- Mina Chang, who used to run a small nonprofit, embellished her résumé, falsely claimed she addressed the Republican and Democratic national conventions and even went as far as fabricating a Time magazine cover with herself on it. Somehow she landed a plum political appointment at the State Department. Chang joined the State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations as a deputy assistant secretary in April. At some point, she was in consideration for a higher position, but her nomination was withdrawn without explanation. “In her State Department biography, which appears to include the same photograph used in the doctored Time cover, Chang claims that she is ‘an alumna of the Harvard Business School’ who has ‘addressed the Republican and Democratic National Conventions,'"" Reis Thebault reports. ""Chang did complete a program at Harvard, but one very different from the prestigious institution’s master of business administration degree. … The Advanced Management Program has open enrollment. As long as an applicant’s employer sponsors them, and the firm can meet certain standards and foot the $82,000 fee, the person is admitted.”

-- Thanks largely to the two justices installed by Trump, the Supreme Court sounds ready to let the president get rid of legal protections for 700,000 ""dreamers."" Robert Barnes reports on oral arguments: ""The Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the program shielding young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children should end regardless of its legality, and the court’s dominant conservative justices showed no inclination to disagree. … It is one of the court’s most important cases of the term, and the court’s four liberal justices indicated the administration had not met requirements for ending a program with such dire consequences for the immigrants and the economy. But they did not appear to find support from the court’s conservatives, who reserved their toughest questions for those challenging the administration’s actions.

""Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., perhaps the pivotal member of the court, gave no indication that he found the administration’s actions troublesome or unusual. But questioning at oral arguments is not always predictive, and the decision in the case might not come for months. ... The Trump administration moved to scuttle the DACA program in 2017 ... [Jeff] Sessions said that the program could not be defended, basing his decision on a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which said that another Obama program protecting undocumented immigrants was beyond the president’s powers. The Supreme Court deadlocked 4 to 4 in 2016 when considering the issue.""

These are the two men who have joined the court since then: Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted during yesterday's oral arguments that “there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy.” Justice Neil Gorsuch wondered whether courts have a role in reviewing the judgments of the attorney general and homeland security secretary: “What more would you have the government say?” he asked.

-- Jared Kushner and other senior administration officials are planning on setting up web cameras to live-stream the construction of Trump’s border wall, going against the advice of experts. Nick Miroff reports: “Kushner floated the idea during meetings in July, part of a messaging effort to push back against criticism that Trump has failed to deliver on the signature proposal of his 2016 campaign. The Army Corps and CBP have told Kushner that construction contractors do not want their proprietary techniques visible to competitors … Officials at the Army Corps and CBP also were concerned the cameras would show U.S. work crews violating Mexican sovereignty because they sometimes must stray south of the border to maneuver their vehicles and heavy equipment in the desert. Because some of the remote border areas lack network access, the cameras will require their own web connectivity and attendants who could frequently reposition them to keep the lens pointed at the action. Kushner has continued to press forward with the 24-hour-wall-cam idea anyway, viewing the feeds as a crucial part of the administration’s effort to demonstrate irrefutable evidence of progress.”

-- Trump told a crowd at the Economic Club of New York that his daughter Ivanka, Jared's wife, has personally created 14 million new jobs. Yes, that’s a ridiculous number. From New York Magazine: “The entire U.S. economy has created fewer than 6 million new jobs since Trump took office. So Trump is crediting his daughter with having personally created more than 200 percent of all new jobs in the United States. This is like supply-side economics but for authoritarian nepotism. Exactly how she did this remains a subject of some confusion. The mechanism involves the ‘Pledge to America’s Workers,’ in which the chief executives of various firms promise to create some arbitrary number of training and other opportunities. … Last October, Ivanka claimed this initiative had created 6.3 million jobs. … Some of the companies that contributed to this number … admitted they had simply credited all real (or, in some cases, hypothetical) job openings to the Ivanka initiative.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Hillary Clinton claimed that “many, many, many people” are urging her to run for president in 2020 and refused to close the door to an 11th-hour entry. ""Never say never,"" she told BBC Radio. Felicia Sonmez and Robert Costa report: “Advisers to Clinton have said at various times over the past year that she is unwilling to completely shut the door to a potential 2020 bid. … In the Tuesday radio interview, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked by host Emma Barnett about her future plans. Clinton replied that she wants to see President Trump ‘retired’ and is ‘going to be helping our side try to put together the strongest possible campaign, which will be difficult.’ ‘Are you going to run again?’ Barnett asked. ‘No,’ Clinton replied. ‘Not, no. I’m –’ ‘That is 100 percent?’ the host continued. ‘So in a few days, I’m not going to open my newspaper –’ ‘Well, you know, I’d never say never to anything,’ Clinton said.”

-- Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford ended his primary challenge against Trump, blaming the impeachment drama for making it impossible to discuss his substantive policy differences with the president. David Weigel and Colby Itkowitz report: “Sanford, who launched his protest campaign two months ago, announced his decision during a news conference in New Hampshire. He had been planning to file in the early-primary state Friday. ‘You’ve got to be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ Sanford said. ‘All of the oxygen is leaving the room — in terms of meaningful debate, on what comes next in our country on a whole host of issues.’ Sanford, 59, who was a rare Trump critic among Republicans in Congress, lost his congressional seat last year after a pro-Trump challenger accused him of being disloyal to the president. … With the Republican Party unified around Trump, he was unable to gain any real traction or attention. As he exited the race, Sanford lambasted the ‘atrocious’ way Republicans in South Carolina and some other states had restricted or canceled their Republican primaries to pave the way for Trump. ‘I don’t think we want to get our cues on electoral participation from North Korea,’ he said.”

-- Former Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan endorsed Biden for president. ""America can’t afford a president who jeopardizes the success and dignity of its workers to make himself feel tough,"" the Ohio congressman said in a statement released by Biden's campaign.

-- The Biden campaign also released the names of 133 foreign policy officials who’ve endorsed the former vice president. Josh Rogin writes: “The list of endorsers also reinforces Biden’s call for a return to a more centrist, traditional foreign policy — not a progressive break from the norm ... Many of the new endorsers were senior national security officials in the Obama-Biden administration and have had ties to Biden for many years, including former national security adviser Tom Donilon, former undersecretary of state Nick Burns, former deputy CIA director Avril Haines, former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco and Biden’s former national security advisers Jake Sullivan and Colin Kahl. Many of these officials are prepared to be public surrogates for the Biden campaign and can testify to his specific actions and accomplishments on foreign policy, not only as vice president, but also as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman for years before that.”

-- Pete Buttigieg wants to build a bridge to the religious right, but tensions with his husband's family -- who don't approve of homosexuality -- highlight just how difficult that could be. Amy B Wang reports: “The split is resonating even more since [his husband,] Chasten, a 30-year-old former schoolteacher, has attracted his own enthusiastic following and begun holding solo campaign events separate from Buttigieg. … The Glezman family’s strains erupted several months ago when Chasten told The Post about his childhood in Michigan and his anxiety about coming out in high school … The article quoted Chasten saying of his brothers, ‘We never got over it,’ and Rhyan adding, ‘I just don’t support the gay lifestyle.’ The next day, Rhyan woke up to dozens of messages calling him a bigot, a homophobe and worse. ‘It kind of blindsided me,’ Rhyan said. … In Rhyan’s telling, their parents were in fact very supportive of Chasten, and it was Rhyan who got the cold shoulder when he announced he was giving himself to Jesus. … The Buttigieg campaign declined requests for Chasten to comment for this article, but emphasized that Rhyan Glezman does not speak for the family.”

-- Before Elizabeth Warren became a Democrat, her political worldview was shaped by her time at Rutgers and the University of Pennsylvania. From the Philadelphia Inquirer: “Many of her former classmates say Warren’s time at the liberal hotbed in North Jersey must have influenced the politics she now embraces. … ‘It was an exciting time to be studying law in terms of people who really wanted to make change,’ said Mimi Marchev, who … entered Rutgers with Warren in 1973. ‘That was sort of the tenor of the place. It wasn’t a feeder into corporate law.’ … Interviews with more than a dozen of Warren’s classmates, teachers, colleagues, and students, along with a review of yearbooks, Penn archives, and Warren’s legal writing, revealed how the two institutions influenced her and offered early glimpses of defining traits she now uses to drive a campaign around big and politically risky policy plans. … Classmates remember ‘Liz’ as smart, energetic, and laser-focused, a necessity for balancing classes with being a mother and homemaker. Driving to Newark in a blue Volkswagen Beetle, she would bring her lunch, and occasionally her young daughter, Amelia. If friends couldn’t watch Amelia, Warren would bring her to class.”

“That might be a strategy,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said with a coy smile when asked about the possibility of a trial that disrupts the Democratic campaign. “But I’ll leave that up to others. I’m just a lowly worker.”

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a McConnell ally, said the Senate would try to distinguish itself during impeachment “by doing this right,” with a trial that probably lasts five or six weeks. But he acknowledged the timing could have an effect on the campaign by giving a potential boost to presidential candidates who have no official role in the process.

“Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden might like that,” Cornyn said of the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and the former vice president, who now poll in the top four in Iowa with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

AD

There is an emerging divide among Republicans, however, over timing. While some Republicans favor a lengthy trial as a means of defending President Trump and creating problems for Democrats, others are calling for swift dismissal or final vote.

AD

The Democratic senators who remain in the presidential race have all said publicly that the impeachment proceedings are more important than political concerns. But advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes, and Sanders has spoken about the potential challenges of an extended trial if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump and sends the case to the Senate.

“We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to,” Sanders said Sunday at an event in Charles City, Iowa, when asked about a potential trial in January. “But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult.”

AD

Warren said Wednesday that she has “constitutional responsibilities” and “if the House goes forward and sends impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.”

AD

One top adviser to a senator running for president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy, said the campaign was already rearranging fundraising and campaign schedules to prepare for a trial.

“We’ve been all but told that January is when we should expect not to have them,” the person said. “And that in December is when we should expect to have them.”

The issue of trial length came up during a closed-door lunch of all GOP senators Wednesday, when Republicans speculated about whether the House would hand over the process to them either before or after Christmas, according to multiple people in attendance.

AD

Inside the lunch, McConnell had little guidance for his ranks, outside of saying the trial will go on as long as the Senate wants it to run, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details from the private meeting.

AD

But McConnell’s deputies, as well as most of his ranks, believe a longer trial is the likelier outcome — which they say would give Trump and his defense team sufficient time to make his case.

Cornyn said Wednesday that it would be difficult to find a majority in the Senate to dismiss the trial early on, even if the president’s attorneys request it, “before the evidence is presented.”

“I think the consensus in our conference is at least that we need to proceed and take seriously the responsibility we have,” said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the second-ranking Senate Republican. “How long that takes is an open question . . . but I suspect that, you know, it’d go on for a while.”

AD

Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who has speculated publicly that a Senate trial could run as long as eight weeks, argued during the lunch that former president Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings in the Senate took five weeks but that Trump’s case was likely to take more time because he has not admitted to any wrongdoing.

AD

Clinton “admitted that he had lied to the FBI,” Burr said before the lunch. “I figured it’s going to take longer for them to make a case, because they don’t have that.”

One White House official said the president is not yet concentrating on a trial but has spoken with McConnell, Vice President Pence and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, about the outlook in the chamber. Newly hired White House aides who are working on impeachment issues have also been meeting with Senate GOP staffers this month.

AD

McConnell has not publicly committed to a timeline for a trial. “I think it’s impossible to predict how long we’ll be on it or predict which motions would pass,” the GOP leader said Wednesday.

But McConnell will not be able to set the schedule in isolation. The rules for an impeachment trial, including a process for calling witnesses, must be passed by 51 or more senators, since Pence is not able to cast a deciding vote on the question. That gives McConnell, who oversees a 53-seat Republican majority, relatively little room to maneuver.

AD

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has been a sharp critic of Trump’s behavior on Ukraine, and more independent-minded senators, like Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), could side with Democrats to force a process that Democrats accept as fair, according to a person familiar with Republican discussions.

AD

A separate group of centrist Senate Republicans facing tough reelection fights next year have been telling McConnell and colleagues that they do not want the process to be rushed, worrying that any move to quickly dispense with a trial risks giving their Democratic opponents an opening to say they did not take their duties seriously.

That view has been bolstered by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who has privately told conservative colleagues they must give breathing room to Republicans running in 2020 and let the trial play out for at least a few weeks, according to two Republican aides briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.

AD

“This is going to require a great deal of work, and I don’t think it should be rushed through,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is up for reelection in 2020. Collins said any attempt to dismiss impeachment at the outset of a trial would be met with vocal opposition by a “lot of senators, who’d have misgivings and reservations about treating articles of impeachment that way.”

AD

On the other hand, several Trump allies are planning to prepare a motion to dismiss that they could propose early on during a trial.

“The sooner we’re done with this, the better,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “Why just have people sitting around for this partisan sham? As soon as we possibly can dismiss this or vote along party lines, especially if the Democrats in the House limit the witnesses, I’ll move to do that.”

AD

Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) also dismissed the prospect of a lengthy trial, saying a “week is more than enough.”

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been talking with Democratic senators, including those running for president, to decide the best way to approach any negotiation with McConnell about whether Democrats join in a resolution setting up the Senate process.

“Given articles of impeachment haven’t even been drafted, it’s impossible to know what either side would want a trial to look like,” said a person familiar with Schumer’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. Schumer declined Wednesday to discuss his next steps but warned that a trial should not be “truncated.”

McConnell’s general template remains the Senate impeachment trial of Clinton in early 1999, which lasted five weeks and had a bipartisan consensus at its start about how it would proceed, according to McConnell’s aides and allies.

Discussions on Senate rules in 1999 broke down repeatedly before the chamber finally agreed on a compromise by a margin of 100-to-0.

An initial proposal by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) to make a full trial contingent on a two-thirds supermajority finding Clinton’s alleged offenses impeachable faced fierce objection from Republicans.

“When I presented it to the Republican conference, they did everything but stone me and throw me out in the hall,” said former senator Trent Lott (Miss.), who was then the Republican leader.

A compromise was reached later in a closed-door meeting for all senators in the Old Senate Chamber, when Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) agreed they should start the trial before deciding whether witnesses would be called before the full body.

Lott said McConnell and Schumer might have a more challenging time striking a deal.

“This is a different situation,” he said. “You do have a divided Congress. You do have a president who has agitated a lot of people.”"

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: President Trump called John Bolton at home to complain after he saw a CNN report last December that said the U.S. Navy was preparing to sail a warship into the Black Sea as a show of strength following Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian vessels and sailors, a State Department official testified. The maneuvers were canceled after the then-national security adviser conveyed these concerns.

That’s one of the eyebrow-raising, Russia-related revelations in the three transcripts released on Monday night by House impeachment investigators, as they prepare for the start of televised hearings tomorrow. The disclosure hints at Trump playing a more hands-on role in Ukraine policy than his defenders want to acknowledge as they search for possible fall guys to pin the blame on.

Trump talks a big game about how important it is to be strong on the world stage, and he’s declared that “nobody has been tougher on Russia” than he has been, but his recurring impulse to disregard Vladimir Putin’s provocations has been anything but. It’s put him at odds with many of the more hawkish aides he installed in the national security firmament.

“We met with Ambassador Bolton and discussed this, and he made it clear that the president had called him to complain about that news report. And that may have just been that he was surprised,” said Christopher Anderson, a senior Ukraine specialist at the State Department. “I can't speculate as to why, but that operation was canceled.”

Anderson recalled hearing Bolton joke about how Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, seemed to pop up every time Ukraine was mentioned, according to the 118-page transcript of his Oct. 30 deposition. He also said that Gordon Sondland, the Trump megadonor who got appointed as ambassador to the European Union, played an outsized role, even though Ukraine is not a member of the E.U.

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has orchestrated a separatist war in the eastern part of Ukraine that has left at least 13,000 people dead. In November 2018, Russia escalated the conflict again by capturing three Ukrainian-flagged military vessels and detaining 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait as they headed to a Ukrainian port in the Sea of Azov.

“While my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,” Anderson testified.

Instead, it was left to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to condemn the move. Later, Trump would cite the Russian seizure of the vessels when he canceled a scheduled meeting with Putin during the G-20 in Argentina. But Anderson said that Ukrainian officials noticed Trump’s silence, especially as other Western leaders spoke out, and they asked their counterparts in the American government why the White House never expressed support.

Ironically, Anderson explained, the CNN story that prompted the president’s complaint to Bolton was overblown. (He said during the hearing that he thought it came out in early January, but the piece was published in December.)

“The news report seemed to be, in my understanding, exaggerating the situation, because all the Navy had done was file a standard notification under the Montreux Convention that they were planning to transit into the Black Sea,” Anderson said.

The Montreux Convention is a 1936 treaty that requires any country without coastline on the Black Sea to notify Turkey at least 15 days before transiting a military vessel through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, which connect the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.

Anderson, a career foreign service officer, added that U.S. officials forged ahead with a subsequent operation in February to show support for Ukraine by deploying an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer to Odessa on the fifth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Crimea.

-- Other witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have also linked the Russia and Ukraine sagas. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified that Trump appeared to sour on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky between their calls on April 21 and July 25 partly because of conversations he had with Putin, the Russian president, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

-- A belief that Ukraine is part of Russia’s sphere of influence has been cited by other inside sources as a possible explanation for Trump’s treatment of Kyiv. During a meeting with his own aides in the fall of 2017, before a sit-down with Ukraine’s previous president, former aides have told us that Trump grumbled that Ukraine is not a “real country” and that it had always been a part of Russia.

-- In another transcript released Monday night, State Department Ukraine specialist Catherine Croft revealed that Mick Mulvaney – before he became acting White House chief of staff – placed a peculiar hold on the sale of Javelin antitank missiles to Ukraine. It was “highly unusual,” she explained, because he was running the Office of Management and Budget at the time. She said the policy concern he expressed related to how the Russians would react, which was outside of his primary portfolio, and came after the secretaries of defense and state had signed off. Ultimately, Croft said, then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster had her brief Mulvaney on the value of the weapons and he dropped his hold after “a week or two.”

“In a briefing with Mr. Mulvaney, the question centered around the Russian reaction,” Croft testified. “That Russia would react negatively to the provision of Javelins to Ukraine.”

-- Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense, said during her deposition that it, similarly, seemed peculiar when OMB officials froze aid to Ukraine this summer. The Pentagon had greenlighted the money, and there was consensus that the money was essential across the national security apparatus, when the budget office blocked the money from being transferred, reportedly at Trump’s apparent behest.

-- The latest tranche of testimony further undercuts the Trump team’s talking point that there couldn’t have been a quid pro quo because Ukrainian leaders didn’t find out that nearly $400 million in congressional approved security assistance had been frozen until Politico reported on it in late August. Croft said the Ukrainians “found out very early on” after the OMB froze the funds at Trump’s behest on July 18.

Cooper told investigators that Kurt Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine and Croft’s boss at the time, led her to make a “very strong inference” that the Ukrainians knew weeks before the freeze became public. The deputy assistant secretary of defense testified that Ukrainian leaders would never have entertained Volker’s request for a public statement about launching investigations unless they were doing so in exchange for “something valuable.” Furthermore, Cooper noted that acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor was also sounding “alarm bells … that there were Ukrainians who knew” about the freeze before it became publicly known, though she didn’t provide specific dates.

Cooper testified that her team at the Pentagon was especially concerned the funds were being held up by the White House this summer because it weakened Ukraine’s hand in negotiations with Russia. “They are trying to negotiate a peace with Russia, and if they are seen as weak, and if they are seen to lack the backing of the United States for their armed forces, it makes it much more difficult for them to negotiate a peace on terms that are good for Ukraine,” she said.

-- Two of Trump’s other explanations also don’t hold up under scrutiny. “The president, in his defense, asserts that he was concerned about corruption writ large in Ukraine, not in securing some 2020 election advantage. In addition, he says he was angered that European allies were not doing enough financially to help the beleaguered country, leaving the United States to carry the can,” Karen DeYoung and Ellen Nakashima report. But, on the July 25 call, “Trump did not mention any wider concern about overall corruption related to U.S. assistance, the subject that he and senior administration officials now insist was the basis for the sudden holdup after years of steady security aid.” Also: “European nations have far outpaced the United States in Ukraine, spending $18.3 billion since Russia annexed Crimea … By contrast, combined military and nonmilitary assistance from the United States has totaled about $4 billion over the same period…”

-- Connecting the dots: Career employees have emerged as crucial witnesses more than in any political scandal in modern history. “All but one of the 11 career Foreign Service staff, military officers and Pentagon officials who first testified in closed-door depositions in the Capitol basement are still in government,"" Lisa Rein reports. ""For now, they’ve faced no efforts to punish them for telling House investigators that normal diplomacy was bypassed by a rogue foreign policy to benefit Trump politically, their lawyers say. However, former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who is scheduled to testify publicly on Friday, is close to retirement and told House investigators that she felt ‘threatened’ by the president — and worried about her pension and her employment.”

MORE ON MULVANEY:

-- The White House’s bifurcated and disjointed response to the impeachment inquiry has been fueled by a battle between Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Erica Werner, Josh Dawsey, Carol D. Leonnig and Rachael Bade report: “Mulvaney has urged aides not to comply with the inquiry and blocked any cooperation with congressional Democrats. Top political aides at the Office of Management and Budget, which Mulvaney once led, have fallen in line with his defiant stance ... Mulvaney’s office blames [Cipollone] for not doing more to stop other government officials from participating in the impeachment inquiry, as a number of State Department officials, diplomats and an aide to Vice President Pence have given sworn testimony to Congress.

""Cipollone, meanwhile, has fumed that Mulvaney only made matters worse with his Oct. 17 news conference, when he publicly acknowledged a quid pro quo, essentially confirming Democrats’ accusations in front of television cameras and reporters. Cipollone did not want Mulvaney to hold the news conference, a message that was passed along to the acting chief of staff’s office, according to two senior Trump advisers ... A Mulvaney aide said a team of White House lawyers prepared him for the news conference and never said he should not do it.

“Neither Mulvaney nor Cipollone has broad experience navigating a White House through such a tumultuous period. But their actions have contributed to the White House’s increasingly tenuous response to the impeachment inquiry ... Despite the high stakes, the White House moved slowly to hire a staff specifically dedicated to working on the impeachment issue, a concern that was expressed to the White House by multiple GOP senators … Another dispute between the Mulvaney and Cipollone camps emerged over the potential hiring of former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) ... Mulvaney advocated for hiring his former House colleague and longtime friend ... But Cipollone was opposed. ... Some Hill Republicans were not pleased and have accused Cipollone of being territorial behind the scenes. They wanted Gowdy ... to lead the cross-examination for Trump in the Senate — a role Cipollone is said to want for himself. ...

""Trump has complained about his legal team to White House officials and advisers in recent weeks, saying they need to be more aggressive and defend him more. ... At the same time, Trump has been complaining about Mulvaney, blaming him for his political troubles, and has toyed with the idea of replacing him ... Some administration officials complain that Cipollone has not kept Mulvaney and other White House offices in the loop on key decisions. Cipollone’s office released the transcript of the president’s July 25 call with his Ukrainian counterpart — a move Mulvaney opposed ... Neither the acting chief of staff nor some members of the White House press office knew ahead of time that was going to happen. ...

""GOP senators have been worried that the White House was moving too slowly to hire staffers specifically dedicated to working on the impeachment issue as the inquiry moves into its public phase. Multiple senators made this concern known to the White House, the aide said. Their concerns were finally alleviated last week with news that Pam Bondi, a former attorney general of Florida, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman, would join the administration to work on impeachment-related messaging and other issues.""

-- Last night, Mulvaney withdrew a last-minute effort to join a lawsuit filed by Bolton's former top deputy, Charles Kupperman. Spencer Hsu reports: ""Mulvaney said he will file his own lawsuit focused on the same question: Must senior Trump administration officials testify in Congress’s impeachment inquiry? Kupperman, in a filing earlier Monday, opposed Mulvaney’s request to join the case ... Kupperman attorney Charles J. Cooper, who also represents Bolton, had suggested that the same judge weigh Mulvaney’s claims 'in tandem' as a separate, related case. The two former Trump national security aides are said by people close to them to consider Mulvaney a key participant in President Trump’s alleged effort to pressure the Ukrainian government ... Mulvaney’s attempt to join the lawsuit flabbergasted Bolton and Kupperman ... with Bolton aides having testified that he derisively referred to the Ukrainian proposal as 'a drug deal,' and White House officials saying Bolton and Mulvaney were barely on speaking terms when Bolton left his post in September.""

THE LATEST ON THE INQUIRY:

-- Congressional Republicans are sticking with Trump despite the mounting evidence showing that he leveraged foreign policy for political favors, making it more likely that no House Republican will vote for his impeachment. Rachael Bade reports: “Democrats had hoped to peel off Republican support from a key bloc — retiring lawmakers who need not worry about internal blowback or primary challenges. Yet many are refusing to break with Trump. Rep. Peter T. King of New York made a point of stating his intention to vote against impeaching Trump in his retirement announcement Monday, a troubling sign for Democrats. … GOP cohesion will test Democrats’ impeachment strategy as they moved their inquiry into the public sphere Wednesday. Democrats recognize that the onus is on them to make the case to independent voters who don’t have time to sift through thousands of pages of transcripts alleging presidential misconduct.” (Clip and save for tomorrow: The Fact Checker's guide to impeachment hearing spin.)

-- Giuliani is considering launching his own impeachment podcast. From CNN: “Giuliani was overheard discussing the plans with an unidentified woman while at a crowded New York City restaurant, Sant Ambroeus, over lunch on Saturday. The conversation, which lasted more than an hour, touched on details including dates for recording and releasing the podcast, settling on a logo, and the process of uploading the podcast to iTunes and other podcast distributors. Two people who overheard Giuliani's discussion reached out to CNN and provided a recording they decided to make of the conversation. … Giuliani's intention seems to be to have four episodes finished before the start of the Senate trial.”

-- Condoleezza Rice called the reports of Giulaini's efforts in Ukraine ""deeply troubling."" “What I see right now troubles me. I see a state of conflict between the foreign policy professionals and someone who says he’s acting on behalf of the president but, frankly, I don’t know if that is the case,” the former secretary of state said at a conference in Abu Dhabi. “It is troubling. It is deeply troubling.” (Reuters)

-- Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson denies that he sought to undermine or work against Trump, as former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley claims in her new book. Anne Gearan reports: “‘During my service to our country as the Secretary of State, at no time did I, nor to my direct knowledge did anyone else serving along with me, take any actions to undermine the President,’ Tillerson said in a statement to The Washington Post. ‘My conversations with the President in the privacy of the Oval Office were always candid, frank, and my recommendations straightforward. Once the President made a decision, we at the State Department undertook our best efforts to implement that decision,’ Tillerson said. ‘Ambassador Haley was rarely a participant in my many meetings and is not in a position to know what I may or may not have said to the President. I continue to be proud of my service as our country’s 69th Secretary of State.’”

-- A federal judge appointed by Trump ruled that the president can’t sue New York state officials in a D.C. court to stop the release of his tax returns to Congress. From CNN: “Effectively, the ruling is a loss for Trump but a less significant one then the blows other courts have dealt him in cases involving Democrats' pursuits of his financial records. Courts have sided with the House multiple times in cases where its committees have subpoenaed Trump's financial records. Trump is still appealing those rulings, keeping the House subpoenas on hold.”

-- Trump falsely claimed that he signed the Whistleblower Protection Act. In a tweet, Trump claimed that he signed a law that Congress passed 30 years ago. He was responding to a message sent by the White House Twitter account that correctly stated that Trump signed a separate measure – the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which, among other things, aims to protect whistleblowers within the Department of Veteran Affairs. Trump appears to have misread the tweet. (Felicia Sonmez, John Wagner, Elise Viebeck and Brittany Shammas)

Douglas MacMillan and Neena Satija report: “Over the past two decades, Newsom (D) and his wife have accepted more than $700,000 from the [PG&E], its foundation and its employees as the utility has supported his political campaigns, his ballot initiatives, his inauguration festivities and his wife’s foundation, including her film projects, according to records reviewed by The Washington Post. The contributions illustrate Newsom’s ties to the company responsible for wildfires that have killed at least 85 people and caused billions of dollars in damage over the past three years. The governor has slammed PG&E for paying bonuses to executives and cash dividends to its investors instead of spending more on infrastructure upgrades that could have prevented the fires. … Between 2011 and 2018, the utility’s philanthropic arm gave $358,000 to the Representation Project, a nonprofit group founded by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the governor’s wife. The PG&E Corporation Foundation also gave $10,000 to the PlumpJack Foundation, a charity led by his sister, Hilary Newsom, according to information provided by PG&E. ...

“PG&E, an investor-owned utility whose largest shareholders include hedge funds Knighthead Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management, filed for bankruptcy in January, declaring itself unable to pay the billions of dollars in mounting liabilities from repeated seasons of wildfires. Its market value is about $3.4 billion, after losing more than $30 billion in equity value over the past two years. When a federal judge asked PG&E in July to explain why its political spending was ‘more important than replacing or repairing the aging transmission lines,’ the company said it needs to make the concerns of its employees, customers and shareholders known to policymakers.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency will limit the science used to write public health rules. From the New York Times: “A new draft of the Environmental Protection Agency proposal, titled Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would require that scientists disclose all of their raw data, including confidential medical records, before the agency could consider an academic study’s conclusions. E.P.A. officials called the plan a step toward transparency and said the disclosure of raw data would allow conclusions to be verified independently. … The measure would make it more difficult to enact new clean air and water rules because many studies detailing the links between pollution and disease rely on personal health information gathered under confidentiality agreements. And, unlike a version of the proposal that surfaced in early 2018, this one could apply retroactively to public health regulations already in place.”

-- Google is engaged with one of the U.S.’s largest health-care systems on a project to collect and analyze the personal health information of millions of people across 21 states. From the Journal: “The initiative, code-named ‘Project Nightingale,’ appears to be the biggest effort yet by a Silicon Valley giant to gain a toehold in the health-care industry through the handling of patients’ medical data. … Google began Project Nightingale in secret last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, a Catholic chain of 2,600 hospitals, doctors’ offices and other facilities, with the data sharing accelerating since summer, according to internal documents. The data involved in the initiative encompasses lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, including patient names and dates of birth. Neither patients nor doctors have been notified. At least 150 Google employees already have access to much of the data on tens of millions of patients, according to a person familiar with the matter and the documents.”

-- A federal health contract funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to at least eight former White House, presidential transition and campaign officials. From Politico: “They were among at least 40 consultants who worked on a one-year, $2.25 million contract directed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma. The contractors were hired to burnish Verma’s personal brand and provide ‘strategic communications’ support. They charged up to $380 per hour for work traditionally handled by dozens of career civil servants in CMS's communications department. The arrangement allowed the Trump allies to cycle through the federal government's opaque contracting system, charging hefty fees with little public oversight or accountability.”

-- Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi called the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a “serious mistake” by the Saudi government, comparing it to the accident involving the tech company’s self-driving car that killed a pedestrian last year. Deanna Paul and Faiz Siddiqui report: “‘It’s a serious mistake. We’ve made mistakes, too — with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we’re recovering from that mistake,’ he said in the episode of ‘Axios on HBO.’ ‘I think that people make mistakes, it doesn’t mean they can never be forgiven. I think they have taken it seriously.’ The car accident was caused by a bad sensor, the interviewer reminded Khosrowshahi, then continued, ‘The CIA suggested that the crown prince had a role in ordering the assassination. That’s a different thing — you didn’t intentionally run someone over.’ About an hour later, Khosrowshahi contacted Axios to clarify his comments on Khashoggi. 'I said something in the moment that I do not believe. When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused,' he wrote in an email, according to the publication.""

-- Southwest Airlines is operating 49 planes that may not have been properly inspected, a top Federal Aviation Administration official said. Lori Aratani reports: “The aircraft in question are among 88 used jets purchased from foreign carriers by Southwest between 2013 and 2017. The planes underwent special inspections, including reviews of their maintenance records, before being cleared to fly, according to the FAA. But now the quality of those inspections is being questioned. … H. Clayton Foushee, director of the FAA’s Office of Audit and Evaluation, raised concerns about the contractors Southwest had used to inspect the aircraft, noting that subsequent reviews by FAA inspectors and the airline had turned up hundreds of instances of undocumented repairs that were made on the planes that were not identified in previous reviews.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is seriously considering joining the presidential race. From the Times: Patrick has told Joe Biden and “other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations … Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats. … Mr. Patrick spoke to Mr. Biden in a phone conversation last week that he was weighing a bid, but did not indicate that he had fully decided to run...

“Mr. Patrick’s candidacy could reshape the already-fluid primary field. He is well known in next-door New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary in February. And as one of the first black governors in the country’s history, he could also prove a formidable candidate in South Carolina, where black voters are expected to make up more than half the Democratic electorate. If he is to compete in New Hampshire, Mr. Patrick would have to file there this week: The deadline to appear on the state’s ballot is Friday. A possible Patrick candidacy could complicate the strategic assumptions for a number of candidates, including the two leaders in most polls, Mr. Biden and [Elizabeth] Warren. Mr. Patrick could threaten the former vice president’s support from black voters and also make inroads in New Hampshire, where Ms. Warren is counting on a strong performance in the southern part of the state that borders Massachusetts. He and Ms. Warren have had an amicable, if not personally close relationship; when she was asked at an event last week to name African-Americans she’d want in her cabinet, she included Mr. Patrick.” Patrick has been working at Bain Capital since leaving office in 2015.

-- A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Biden holding a narrow edge in the New Hampshire race. From CNN: “Biden stands at 20%, with [Warren] at 16%, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 15% and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 14% in a tight race for second place. No other candidates reach double digits in the poll.”

-- During a CNN town hall in Iowa, Biden renewed his attacks against Warren’s Medicare-for-all plan, saying it comes from the elitist belief that Americans shouldn’t be allowed to make up their own minds on health care. From CNN: Biden also “said he's merely been responding after ‘she attacked me.’ … Biden said his criticism wasn't about Warren personally, and he went on to describe the attitude he said was behind advocating the health care plan she backs.”

-- Biden’s rivals are scrambling to dent his support from black voters. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Amy B Wang report: “Rather than attack Biden directly, his rivals are mostly deploying tactics that include church visits and tailgate parties, and holding private conversations and teaming up with young influencers who can spread the word. … In the interest of that catch-up, Biden’s rivals are trying to play to whatever strengths they have. Warren is making appeals to black women. Buttigieg and Sanders are aiming at younger activists, largely ceding the older generation to Biden. The goal for Biden’s rivals, at least for now, is not to overtake him among black voters but to come out of the South Carolina primary with at least a respectable showing, Democratic strategists say — and to be well-positioned in case Biden stumbles in Iowa or New Hampshire, which hold votes shortly before South Carolina.”

-- Iowa voters are questioning Buttigieg’s moderate message even as he surges in the polls, reports our former Daily 202 colleague Joan E. Greve now at the Guardian: “With less than three months to go until Iowa voters hold their caucuses, the looming question over Buttigieg’s surprise campaign is whether he will maintain the momentum he has seen in recent weeks or fizzle out as other Democratic candidates have. Some of his opponents’ allies have dismissed the validity of Buttigieg’s surge, calling the young mayor ‘the flavor of the moment.’ But Buttigieg’s campaign insists his current momentum in Iowa is legitimate, powered by more than 100 staffers spread across more than 20 field offices. … Buttigieg’s apparent recalculation away from progressive policies like Medicare for All has led some to question the sincerity of his campaign promises. One rally attendee described the mayor as ‘kind of smarmy’ and suggested he tone down his ‘salesman’ persona. But many attendees were impressed with Buttigieg’s performance on the stump and his evident gifts as a politician. ‘He seems like somebody you’d know down the block, which is very rewarding and comforting,’ said Kate Payne, 61.”

-- Facebook’s top news executive, Campbell Brown, has her own media outlet that has, in recent weeks, harshly attacked Warren. From Popular Information: “In 2015, Brown co-founded The 74, which focuses on the public education system, and served as editor-in-chief. Even after joining Facebook in 2017, Brown has maintained an active role in The 74, where she is a member of the board of directors. … On October 23, The 74 published an article with this headline: ‘Elizabeth Warren’s Education Plan Is Exactly What We Need — If Our Goal Is to Make the Achievement Gap Permanent.’”

-- Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the widow of Elijah Cummings, is running for her late husband’s seat. From the Baltimore Sun: “‘I am, of course, devastated at the loss of my spouse, but his spirit is with me,’ Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, said in an interview with The Baltimore Sun. ‘I’m going to run this race and I’m going to run it hard, as if he’s still right here by my side.’ … Rockeymoore Cummings, a public policy consultant who is founder of the Washington consulting firm Global Policy Solutions LLC and a former 2018 candidate for governor, said her husband told her months before he died he would like for her to succeed him. … Rockeymoore Cummings plans to kick off her campaign Tuesday at her home office in Baltimore’s Madison Park neighborhood. She said she will focus on issues important to the late congressman, such as battling the opioid crisis and ‘fighting for the soul of our democracy’ against the Trump administration, but also on her areas of expertise, which include health and education policy. … Rockeymoore Cummings said she will resign as chairwoman of the state Democratic Party to avoid any appearance of favoritism. That means state Sen. Cory V. McCray will rise to interim chairman.”

-- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it appears Gov. Matt Bevin lost his bid for reelection in Kentucky, even though Bevin still hasn’t conceded the race. From WFPL.org in Louisville: “‘I’m sorry Matt came up short, but he had a good four years and I think all indications are — barring some dramatic reversal on recanvass — that we’ll have a different governor in three weeks,’ McConnell told reporters after an event at North American Stainless in Ghent. The unofficial results of last week’s election showed Beshear defeating Bevin by 5,189 votes … When asked if Bevin should concede following the recanvass, McConnell said he wouldn’t give the governor any advice, but then seemed to urge the governor to move on. ‘My first election was almost the exactly the same number of votes that Beshear won by. We had a recanvass, they added them up, it didn’t change and we all moved on,’ McConnell said.”

-- Also in Kentucky, Democratic state Rep. Charles Booker launched an exploratory committee for a potential run against McConnell. From the Courier Journal: “Booker, 35, a first-term state legislator, told The Courier Journal he filed the paperwork for his committee Monday and plans to launch a statewide listening tour by the end of November before he makes a final decision on whether to run. … He said he's tired of McConnell using Kentucky as a ‘poker chip’ to gain power while the Bluegrass State suffers.”

-- The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments today in a case that will decide the fates of nearly 700,000 “dreamers.” A decision is expected to come next June, during the home stretch of the presidential election. Robert Barnes reports: “The Trump administration has tried for more than two years to ‘wind down’ the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, announced by President Barack Obama in 2012 to protect from deportation qualified young immigrants who came to the country illegally. Individual DACA recipients, giant corporations, civil rights groups and universities have challenged the administration’s plans, and won. Lower courts have found that the administration relied on faulty legal analysis for ending the program, rather than providing lawful reasons that the courts and the public could evaluate. … Dozens of briefs have been filed in what will be one of the court’s marquee cases of the term, many of them only tangentially addressing the legal issues at play. Instead, they extol the doctors, lawyers, engineers, students and military officers whose accomplishments were made possible by the program.”

Smoke rises following an explosion in Gaza early Tuesday. Israeli forces said they carried out an airstrike that killed a senior Palestinian militant. (Mohammed Salem/Reuters)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Israel killed a senior leader of the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad with an airstrike in the Gaza Strip early this morning. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: ""In Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces targeted Baha Abu al-Ata, the militant commander Israel considered responsible for several previous rocket launches on grounds that his next attack was imminent. … In a statement, Palestinian Islamic Jihad confirmed that Abu Al Ata and his wife were killed. … The overnight action was approved by [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu."" Former army chief of staff Benny Gantz, who is trying to form a coalition government, supported the action.

-- Turkey deported U.S. and Danish citizens who fought for ISIS and made plans to expel other foreign nationals, as Ankara begins a new push to send back captured foreign fighters to their home countries. From the AP: “Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said last week that about 1,200 foreign IS fighters were in Turkish prisons and 287 members, including women and children, were recaptured during Turkey’s offensive in Syria. Several European countries, including Britain, have stripped IS fighters of their nationalities to prevent their return. … Turkey’s Sabah newspaper, which is close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government, reported that the U.S. citizen who had been deported was stuck in a heavily militarized no man’s land between the Greece and Turkey borders. … In Denmark, Justice Minister Nick Hakkerup told Danish broadcaster TV2 that any Danish citizens who fought for IS and are repatriated to the country ‘must be punished as severely as possible.’”

-- Ahead of Erdogan’s visit to Washington tomorrow, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) asked the State Department to ban the leader’s bodyguards from entering the country. From National Review: “In May 2017, members of the Turkish Presidential Protection Department (TPPD), Turkey’s equivalent of the Secret Service, attacked pro-Kurdish protesters outside the residence of the Turkish ambassador. The assault, in which protesters and American law-enforcement officials were injured, was captured on video. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Cheney requested that ‘none of the people who were in the United States with President Erdoğan in 2017 and participated in physical attacks on American citizens—including those protesting lawfully, our secret service, our diplomatic service, and our law enforcement officials—will be allowed into the United States again this week.’ … The letter comes in advance of a planned White House visit by Erdogan this Wednesday.”

-- Trump is looking forward to Erdogan’s visit, and he may be the only one in town, laments The Post’s Editorial Board: “Erdogan has jailed hundreds of journalists, academics and others he perceives as political opponents, and purged thousands from their jobs. His offensive into northeastern Syria, under the guise of fighting terrorism and greenlighted by Mr. Trump, has led to ethnic cleansing of Kurds, created a humanitarian disaster and compromised the fight against the Islamic State. He has been emboldened by Mr. Trump’s eagerness to retreat from the region, and there’s little hope that the administration will speak up for the rule of law in Turkey. It is up to Congress to protest — and hopefully mitigate — the damage Mr. Erdogan is causing.”

-- Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced the conditional release of three high profile Taliban prisoners in exchange for kidnapped American and Australian professors. Sharif Hassan reports: “Speaking live on local TV channels in Kabul, Ghani said the decision was taken to and bring ‘peace and stability’ in the country. ‘In consultations with our international partners especially the U.S., we have adopted a mechanism and approach to make sure the release of these three men wouldn’t reinforce the … enemy and intensify attacks by them,’ he said. All three prisoners are members of deadly Haqqani wing of the Taliban that include Anas Haqqani, a younger brother of the group’s leader, Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid. They were held in a government detention center inside Bagram military base. The professors are a U.S. national, Kevin King, and Australian, Timothy Weeks. Both were teaching at the American University of Afghanistan and were kidnapped in 2016.”

-- In Iraq, protesters continue withstanding bullets, tear gas and stun grenades as they call for the ouster of the entire political class. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “More than 319 people have been killed and 15,000 wounded since anti-government demonstrations began in Baghdad and southern cities on Oct. 1, according to the country’s human rights commission. As crowds start to thin, a broader crackdown is starting. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested. Volunteer medics have disappeared on their way to Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, not heard from since. In dozens of interviews, protesters and medics described intelligence officers and unknown individuals appearing in tents full of friends, taking photographs on cellphones and leaving. Activists showed messages on their phones advising them to go home or making blunter threats.”

-- James Le Mesurier, a former British Army officer who founded the White Helmets defense group in Syria and has drawn the ire of the Kremlin, was found dead in Turkey. From the BBC: “Mr Le Mesurier's body was found at about 04:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on the street near his home and office in Istanbul's Beyoglu district on the European side of the city. He was found with fractures to his head and legs, Turkish media say, and is believed to have fallen from his balcony. … The Syrian government and its allies Russia and Iran have accused the White Helmets of openly aiding terrorist organizations and the Russian foreign ministry last week accused Mr. Le Mesurier of being a former agent of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6. The Russian allegation was strongly denied on Monday by Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the UN, who said: ‘The Russian charges against him, that came out of the foreign ministry that he was a spy, are categorically untrue.’”

-- The Trump administration is drafting plans to condition U.S. aid to other countries on how well they treat their religious minorities. From Politico: “The proposal is expected to cover U.S. humanitarian assistance, and could also be broadened to include American military aid to other countries. If the proposal becomes reality, it could have a major effect on U.S. assistance in a range of places, from Iraq to Vietnam. Its mere consideration shows how much the White House prioritizes religious freedom, an emphasis critics say is really about galvanizing Trump’s evangelical Christian base. But experts on U.S. aid also warn that picking and choosing which countries to punish could be a very difficult task, not least because several countries that are partners or allies of the United States have terrible religious freedom records.”

-- Bolivia’s Evo Morales flew off to Mexico after being ousted. From the Guardian: “Earlier on Monday evening Morales tweeted a farewell after his resignation in the wake of a disputed election, saying that he would be take up the offer of asylum in Mexico but would soon ‘return with greater strength and energy.’ The Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted a picture of the former leader draped in the flag of Mexico, and said: ‘The Mexican Air Force plane has already taken off with Evo Morales on board. According to current international conventions, it is under the protection of Mexico. Your life and integrity are safe.’ … A senior US official said that Washington did not consider Morales resignation and departure to constitute a coup. ‘All these events clearly show is the Bolivian people have simply had enough of a government ignoring the will of its voters,’ the official said. … In Mexico Ebrard issued a statement on Monday defining what had happened as a ‘military coup’ and calling for an urgent meeting of the OAS.”

-- So, was what happened in Bolivia a coup? Bolivians are still trying to figure that out. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “All four officials in the constitutional line of succession — the president, the vice president and the heads of the senate and chamber of deputies, all socialists — resigned on Sunday. That left remaining lawmakers scrambling to cobble together a quorum to appoint a new leader — something they appeared unable to do Monday. … Carlos Mesa, the former president who finished second to Morales last month, rejected the word ‘coup.’ Speaking to reporters Monday, he called the events of the previous 24 hours a ‘democratic popular action’ to stop a government that had committed election fraud to install itself as an authoritarian power. … Debate over whether democracy had been restored or broken raged across the region. Morales’s socialists were accused of stealing an election. But critics said the military’s decision to pull its support and the mob rule that forced him out were anything but constitutional. Views fell largely along ideological lines, exposing the political divisions among and within Latin American nations and also the sensitivity to a word — ‘coup’ — that invokes images of 20th-century military interventions in the region, many of them backed by the United States.”

-- Spain was once thought to be immune to the far-right. That changed this past weekend. Chico Harlan and Pamela Rolfe report: “After the Vox party cracked open the door to parliament in April and came in third in national elections on Sunday, Spain can be singled out for something else: Among major European countries, it is where the far right is gaining ground most quickly. … The Socialist party claimed the most votes in Sunday’s elections — but there was no obvious path for any party on the left or right to easily form a government in Spain’s fragmented system. The Socialists, led by acting prime minister Pedro Sánchez, won 120 of 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies. The center-right Popular Party, which has been plagued by corruption scandals, came in second with 88 seats. And Vox finished with 52, compared with 24 seats in elections in April.”

-- The U.K.’s Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage offered Prime Minister Boris Johnson a truce, upping his chances of success in next month’s election. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Farage said he would not field candidates for the 317 seats that Johnson’s Conservative Party won in 2017. That means, in half of Britain, voters who hunger to leave the European Union will not have to decide between a pro-Brexit Conservative candidate and a really, really pro-Brexit Brexit Party candidate.”

-- Australia’s former top diplomat in the U.K., Alexander Downer, said Australia should reduce its UK intelligence sharing if Jeremy Corbyn wins the election. From the Guardian: “In an excoriating assessment of the Labour leader at the National Press Club in Canberra, Downer contended that a Corbyn victory would imperil substantial Australian investments in Britain, and would trigger a reassessment of the ‘very intimate’ security relationship between Canberra and London.”

-- Israel extradited Russian hacker Aleksey Burkov to the U.S. despite Moscow’s protests. From the Times of Israel: “Burkov, who was arrested in 2015 at the request of Interpol, is wanted in the US on embezzlement charges over a massive credit card scheme that saw him allegedly steal millions of dollars from American consumers. His fate is believed linked to Russia’s sentencing last month of Israeli-American Naama Issachar, 26, to seven and a half years in prison for drug offenses. Israeli officials have decried the sentence as disproportionate and appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin for her release.”

-- Kremlin-linked business owner Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is under U.S. sanctions for his ties to the Internet Research Agency that’s been indicted for interference in the 2016 presidential election, split his business empire with a 27-year-old. From the Moscow Times: “A close Putin ally, Prigozhin is also linked to the Wagner Group of private mercenaries which has reportedly fought alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, been sent to provide personal security to Venezuelean President Nicolas Maduro, and been deployed in the Central African Republic, Mozambique, Madagascar, Libya, eastern Ukraine and Sudan. Prigozhin’s decision to cede half of his main business interest is

-- Don Cherry, the longtime NHL commentator, was fired by the Canadian broadcaster Sportsnet after making divisive comments about immigrants on the air. Cherry, an often controversial commentator, criticized immigrants in Canada for not recognizing Remembrance Day, which many Canadians celebrate by wearing small artificial poppies. “You people love — you, that come here, whatever it is — you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey,” Cherry said. “At least you could pay a couple of bucks for poppies or something like that. These guys paid for your way of life, that you enjoy in Canada.” (Matt Bonesteel, Ben Strauss and Des Bieler)

“Imagine somebody goes to a hotel to rent a room and the clerk says, ‘We’re not renting a room to you because we don’t have rooms available and we don’t rent rooms to black people,’"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of University of California’s Berkeley School of Law, who will argue on Allen’s behalf. “Under Comcast’s theory, that wouldn’t be enough to prove discrimination.”

AD

This could be the most important civil rights case before the Supreme Court this term, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Discovery and trial processes are crucial in understanding whether racial discrimination motivated an action, Clarke said, and requiring victims to meet that burden of proof when they first plead their case would be a “death knell” for the civil rights statute.

“A negative ruling by the court will literally cut out the heart of this most important law by requiring victims of discrimination to demonstrate that race and nothing more influenced the contested action,” Clarke said. “We would essentially shut the courthouse door on most people seeking to invoke protections of this law.”

AD

Comcast said its argument is consistent with previous interpretations of the statute and rejects the notion that its stance would set back civil rights protections.

AD

“We have been forced to appeal this decision to defend against a meritless $20 billion claim,” Sena Fitzmaurice, a spokeswoman for Comcast, said in a statement emailed to The Post. “Our argument at the Supreme Court is narrowly focused. We are not seeking to roll back any civil rights laws.”

Fitzmaurice said the case “cannot detract from Comcast’s strong civil rights and diversity record” and pointed to other black-owned channels carried by Comcast with programming aimed at African American audiences, including Revolt, the music network launched by Sean Combs, and Aspire, owned by Magic Johnson Enterprises.

AD

Allen’s case has garnered support from dozens of civil rights organizations, legal experts and lawmakers, as well as presidential candidates Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The Lawyers’ Committee, headed by Clarke, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund have both filed briefs in support of Allen but did not take a position on the merits of his claims.

AD

“In pursuing this case to the Supreme Court … Comcast is putting corporate profits ahead of public interest, and is employing a scorched earth policy to defend a corporate business decision,” Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) said in a letter to Comcast’s chief executive, Brian Roberts, adding he believes Comcast “needs to be broken up.”

Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was designed to safeguard equal opportunities for Americans to work, bank, shop, rent or buy a home, and become entrepreneurs without racial discrimination, civil rights groups said in the briefs. It protects a broad swath of people, including independent contractors in the gig economy and consumers racially profiled by retailers, in scenarios not covered by other major civil rights statutes, they said. And unlike the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the older statute has no cap on damages.

Allen, 58, sued Comcast in February 2015 for refusing to feature ESN’s lifestyle channels, including Comedy.TV, Recipe.TV, MyDestination.TV, Cars.TV and Pets.TV, though they appeared on Verizon, DirecTV, AT&T and DISH programming. For eight years, Comcast gave the network “the runaround with false promises of carriage,” Allen’s lawyers argued. Comcast said it lacked “sufficient bandwidth” for the ESN channels but launched several “lesser-known, white-owned” channels in the same period.

AD

By way of explanation, Allen’s lawyers allege in their brief, one Comcast executive told ESN, “We’re not trying to create any more Bob Johnsons,” referring to the media magnate and co-founder of Black Entertainment Television.

“I’ve never said they don’t do business with black people,” Allen told The Post. “This has always been about a lack of true economic inclusion.”

AD

A district court dismissed Allen’s suit multiple times before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed that decision in November 2018.

The Justice Department and U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed briefs in support of Comcast, arguing the appeals court erred in deciding that a plaintiff could win by showing that race was just one factor in a decision not to enter into a contract.

“In so doing, the court arrived at a rule that does not apply to any other federal anti-discrimination law: A defendant is subject to damages liability under Section 1981 solely because the plaintiff can prove that an illegitimate motive played a part in the defendant’s conduct, even if the defendant would have taken the challenged action without regard to any protected characteristic,” wrote Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco.

Michael Foreman, a law professor and director of the Civil Rights Appellate Clinic at Pennsylvania State University, called the Trump administration’s support of Comcast “a significant departure” in how the U.S. government has previously addressed race discrimination.

“Given how divided our country is, and that we still have issues of race discrimination … I struggle with whether our justices are willing to say that some level of race discrimination is permissible, which is what they would be saying,” Foreman said.

Back in June, against the usual carping about Iowa and about caucuses, I wrote my quadrennial defense of the Iowa caucuses as an imperfect element of an imperfect nominating system. Usually by this point in the cycle, the complaints have subsided before reaching a crescendo on Caucus Night (February 3) if the results displease people with microphones and bullhorns. But hating on Iowa is sharply evident this week thanks to the vocal unhappiness of candidates who aren’t doing so well there and their considerable resentment of a candidate who is: Pete Buttigieg.

The New York Times amplified the latest round of kvetching:

Former vice-president Joseph R. Biden Jr. said this week — to an Iowa reporter no less — that the caucuses were not “representative …”

And Julián Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said Iowa was “not reflective of the United States” and “not reflective of the Democratic Party.” He called for the state to lose its spot at the front of the presidential nominating calendar.

Even the candidate vying with Buttigieg for the lead in Iowa is feeling some heat, though she hasn’t let it drive her into saying something stupid:

Senator Elizabeth Warren demurred when she was asked at a forum in South Carolina whether the order of the early-nominating states should change because Iowa and New Hampshire were “two of the whitest states in the country.” “Are you actually going to ask me to sit here and criticize Iowa and New Hampshire?,” she said. “I’m just a player in the game.”

The question asked of Warren is clearly related to the hypothesis that Mayor Pete — who was actually in the lead in Iowa, according to a new Monmouth poll of the state — is getting an undue advantage from the order of states because of his weakness among the minority voters who begin weighing in after Iowa and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, candidates who rely heavily on minority voters (basically, the minority candidates plus Biden) are struggling as the bitter winter weather of Iowa and New Hampshire approaches. Ron Brownstein suggests the field may essentially be bleached by the honky hordes of the first two states:

[W]hile all Democratic campaigns expect nonwhite voters, especially African-Americans, to play a central role in picking the nominee, they could be choosing only among white candidates. That will happen if poor performances in preponderantly white Iowa and New Hampshire effectively winnow out the race’s leading candidates of color: African-American Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, Latino former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro, and Asian-American entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Blaming the weakness of minority candidates on the pale complexion of the Iowa and New Hampshire electorates, however, doesn’t explain their poor performance in polling in more diverse states. Castro has never polled better than 2 percent in Nevada. And in Monmouth’s October poll in South Carolina, where a clear majority of Democratic primary voters will be African-American, black candidates Harris and Booker were at a booming 6 percent and 2 percent, respectively.

In any event, as Nate Silver argues, you can get a better sense of where the race stands by looking at the four early states — those whose early order is protected by national party rules — as a unit:

Taken collectively, polls in the four early states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina — tell almost the same story as national polls: Biden leads, Elizabeth Warren is in second, Bernie Sanders is in third, and Buttigieg is still a fairly distant fourth.

Trouble is, Iowa results have typically affected candidates’ standing in New Hampshire, and both have affected subsequent contests. That’s exactly why candidates like Booker and Harris, whose most important state is South Carolina, have gone all in on Iowa, hoping to duplicate Barack Obama’s two-cushion shot in 2008.

Obama’s solid win over Hillary Clinton and John Edwards that year should have dampened the idea that Iowa Democratic caucus-goers only have eyes for white candidates. For that matter, Iowa leaders supported the expansion of the protected early-state tent between the 2004 and 2008 elections to include the more diverse Nevada and South Carolina and would likely be amenable to other accommodations in the future as long as they didn’t threaten the state’s first-in-the-nation status.

A shift away from caucusing is more problematic for Iowans, since it would trigger New Hampshire’s state law requiring it to hold the very first primary. That conundrum is a reminder to those demanding a more “rational” nominating system that there really is no national system at all but instead a calendar of state-party-run caucuses and state-government-run primaries, with the national party influencing the order and the rules of participation by sticks and carrots but not running the show. A big push from the DNC did help reduce the number of caucuses from 10 in 2016 to just three (Iowa, Nevada, and Wyoming) this year, and Iowa Democrats have labored to provide alternative caucusing arrangements that are more convenient to people who work on Caucus Night or have mobility issues. (Unfortunately, a plan to allow caucusing by phone fell prey to hacking fears, and we’ll have to see how well the backup plan for “satellite caucuses” works out).

In the end, presidential candidates fearing the wrath of Iowa and New Hampshire leaders (and voters) and those states’ willingness to adapt and cut deals to keep their position have maintained the traditional calendar. It will take more than halftime complaints about the rules and the refs to change it all. And in the meantime, if Iowa and New Hampshire give Buttigieg more of a lift than he deserves, there will be plenty of opportunities later in the year to bring him right down to earth."

Or to put it another way: What do these candidates think the fundamental problem with the U.S. economy is?

AD

This question is particularly acute for Patrick because, although he has long been thought of as a potentially strong presidential candidate, on economic issues his profile is not exactly built to warm the hearts of the Democratic base.

AD

Patrick has spent his career moving between government and corporate positions, including some that are likely to raise uncomfortable questions among Democratic primary voters. After running the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton, he joined the board of Ameriquest, one of the worst offenders among the subprime mortgage lenders who helped create the Great Recession. Patrick also worked as general counsel for Coca-Cola and Texaco — yes, he was an oil company executive.

And after leaving the governor’s mansion in 2015, Patrick went to Bain Capital, the private equity firm co-founded by Mitt Romney. You may remember that in 2012, Democrats absolutely savaged Romney over Bain’s business model, which often involves buying companies, stripping them for parts and then selling off what’s left at a profit. The attack was so brutally effective that “Saturday Night Live” mocked it with a skit.

AD

It just so happens that among Elizabeth Warren’s economic proposals is one directly targeting private equity. It would impose a new set of requirements on firms like Bain, making it somewhat more difficult for them to still make large profits when the companies they buy go belly up. I can’t say what effect her bill would have on the economy as a whole, but it tells a stark morality tale, about vulture capitalists who line their pockets while ruining the lives of middle-class Americans. It would certainly be interesting to hear her and Patrick debate this.

AD

This highlights both the policy and rhetorical difference between candidates like Warren and Bernie Sanders on one side, and candidates like Patrick, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg on the other. All say they want to address inequality and promote the interests of the middle class. On Patrick’s website, his still-vague “Vision” section talks about “growing the economy out to working people and the marginalized, not just up to the well connected.” They all say they want to build an economy that works for everyone.

But when Warren and Sanders talk about inequality, they tell a story with villains. Inequality didn’t just happen, it’s the result of certain people getting their way, people whose power must be curbed and whose wealth must be aggressively taxed. Warren has a new ad going after billionaires, one you can’t imagine someone such as Patrick or even Joe Biden airing.

AD

That’s true even if they have some policy proposals the capitalist class will find unappealing. Biden, for instance, not only wants to raise the minimum wage but would strengthen unions and bar non-compete clauses that strip workers of power. But he also says, “I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble,” adding that ""I get into a lot of trouble with my party when I say that wealthy Americans are just as patriotic as poor folks.""

AD

A pessimist (or a cynic) might say that ambitious proposals like a wealth tax will never get through Congress anyway, which means that in the end a President Warren will probably end up where a President Biden would begin, with some relatively modest tax increases on the wealthy used to fund more benefits and services aimed at lower- and middle-class people. That’s an entirely plausible scenario.

But it’s also true that as a political matter, the arguments made by the more moderate candidates either devolve into something anodyne or come off sounding, if not insincere, then at least unconvincing. When Patrick says, as he did on Thursday, “We’ve had a system where we have crowded and hoarded all of the benefits of our prosperity in a very, very few. This is what trickle-down economics looks like,” it’s hard not to respond, “I’m glad you feel that way, but don’t you work for Mitt Romney’s private equity firm? Doesn’t that make you the problem?”

AD

The most passionate candidate isn’t always the one who wins, of course. It’s entirely possible that what the public is looking for is a nice fellow whose heart is basically in the right place and who can calm things down a bit. But at this point it’s hard to see Deval Patrick’s message — whatever it turns out to be — transforming the race.

Castro made his comments from Iowa, a state where he has only received 1 percent support in the most recent Monmouth University poll. Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, is leading in Iowa, despite repeatedly making headlines for his relatively dismal support from black voters, according to the most recent poll.

Castro isn’t an outlier in his belief that the lack of diversity in Iowa’s caucus process leaves some voices out. Conversations about changing the primary order surfaced during the last presidential election campaign because of precisely that concern.

AD

LGBT activist Charlotte Clymer argued that Castro is correct and that a state that better reflects the diversity of America should go precede Iowa.

“I have enormous respect for my fellow Americans in Iowa and New Hampshire, but two overwhelmingly white states shaping a race to decide who will lead a nation that is not overwhelming white does not strike me as reflective of a healthy democratic process,” she tweeted.

AD

Activists in the Democratic base have long argued for a change in the primary system. Candidates often determine whether they will keep pursuing the White House, in part, based on their Iowa performance. But that is months before the first primary — South Carolina — that features a significant number of voters of color.

AD

Many Iowans also believe that the current caucus process leaves out some demographics in the state and support changing to a primary system that could lead to greater diversity among participants. According to a new Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll, 44 percent of Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers said it is more important for Iowa to hold a primary “so everyone can vote, even if it means Iowa would no longer” be first.

Some argue that the current caucus system — a long process that happens at night — often excludes people with disabilities, elderly people, working-class voters who work at nights and single parents with child-care needs.

AD

But the argument for keeping Iowa first is that the voters are deeply engaged and accessible. Campaigns without much money or manpower get to take advantage of Iowa’s grass-roots culture to make their case to Americans who are deeply invested in the election.

AD

David Redlawsk, co-author of “Why Iowa? How Caucuses and Sequential Elections Improve the Presidential Nominating Process,” previously told The Fix during the last presidential election: “Iowa may not be perfectly representative [of the United States], but no one state is.”

The political science professor added: “It actually makes more sense in a sequential system not to worry about the ‘representativeness’ of any one state. Combined, the first four carve-out states — Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — do a pretty good job of representing the constituencies and issues that drive American politics.”

AD

Even former vice president Joe Biden, the candidate leading in some national polls with black and Latino voters, acknowledged that the electorates in New Hampshire and Iowa are significantly different from the rest of the country.

AD

“Are they representative historically and practically — based on race and creed and color — of the nation? No, they’re not,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t play a major part.”

When asked if the order of the primaries should change, Biden replied, “No” — even though he ended his 2008 presidential bid after a poor Iowa performance.

“They are first. That’s what they are now. It’s not going to change,” he said. “It is what it is.”

But the idea that something should be because it has always been may not continue to be a winning argument for members of a Democratic base who are increasingly concerned that they aren’t as valued as they should be, especially since people of color make up a growing percentage of the Democratic Party and the left.

Although Castro is not faring much better with people of color than he is performing overall, concerns that a candidate could move forward without significant support from people of color could become more widespread. If members of the base continue to feel ignored or taken for granted, pushback against the status quo will likely intensify until some change is made.

Deval Patrick at the Bridge Cafe in Manchester, N.H., on Thursday. (Charles Krupa/AP)

CONCORD, N.H. — In his first minutes as a candidate for president, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick set his ground rules. He would not be “trying to climb up by pulling anybody else down.” He would make “contrasts,” giving voters the information they needed to distinguish him from 16 other Democratic candidates.

Those contrasts did not have to be nice. Joe Biden seemed to be saying “that if we just get rid of the incumbent, we can go back to doing what we used to do,” Patrick said. Elizabeth Warren, who he was “incredibly fond” of, was running a great campaign that absolutely would not prepare her for the presidency.

“I think the actual business of advancing an agenda, once elected, is a different kind of undertaking,” Patrick told dozens of reporters crowded into the New Hampshire secretary of state's office.

Patrick, whose initial decision to not run for president did not stop allies from urging him on, spent Thursday reintroducing himself as a pragmatist who could stitch together his party and the country. In doing so he divided Democrats even further. The most crowded primary in American history now has, depending on who you ask, two or three credible left-wing contenders, four or five credible center-left candidates, and either one, two or three “front-runners.”

Allies of Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) believe that Patrick could pull voters from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), former vice president Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — anyone at the top but Sanders. Some centrists think that Patrick could offer a pull-the-alarm option if Biden falters, and some worry that he can only further split their vote and widen the opening for Warren or Sanders.

On Wednesday morning, Democrats on the left were worrying that a Warren-Sanders split would leave their movement without a nominee; by Thursday morning, the party's centrist wing seemed to be in disarray.

“If Biden were as strong as Hillary Clinton was in 2016, I would be concerned,” said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Sanders campaign. “But we're going to have the moderate vote split with Biden and Buttigieg and Booker and now Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg. I mean, look at the lines — they're a lot longer on their side than they are on the progressive side.”

There is nothing new about Democratic panic, but there is something different about the mood now, three months before the Iowa caucuses, than in previous cycles. In 2007 and 2015, the primary was simple: Everyone else was in a struggle to become the alternative to Hillary Clinton. A clear establishment-versus-outsider story line had been carved out. Labor unions and party leaders were well into picking their candidates. By this point in 2015, most of the largest labor unions had endorsed Clinton: the National Education Association, the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

None of those unions has made an endorsement yet, and leaders of all three have altered the process so that official candidate backing will come much later. It has become easier for candidates such as Patrick and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has not yet officially entered the race, to pitch themselves as potential saviors to centrists, even as uncertainty ripples through the left. Tomorrow, Sanders will officially accept the endorsement of National Nurses United, three months later than its endorsement of his last campaign. Back then, the union had only one suitor; this year it got pitches from Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg.

“Last time there was just one candidate who backs our issues, so this was more difficult,” said Jean Ross, NNU’s co-president, who said it was largely positive for multiple left-wing candidates to seek the nomination. “I don’t think that can hurt so long as the principle is that health care is a human right. The others, you’ve seen them evolving toward something less, and something less will not work.”

Online, the debate between supporters of Sanders and Warren can grow bitter, something that has begun to worry groups that would be relatively happy with either as a nominee. But there is not much urgency on the left about making a choice before voting begins. The Center for Popular Democracy Action, which has held an endorsement process for a coalition of left-wing community groups, announced this week that Warren, Sanders and Julián Castro had all advanced to the next stage, with an endorsement possible, but not certain, next month.

“The purpose of this endorsement is to make sure a neoliberal does not win the nomination,” explained CPDA co-president Jennifer Epps-Addison. “We are thrilled and excited. Many of us have been waiting our whole lives to have just one progressive be considered a top contender, much less three.”

The tumult among the party's centrists — a hard term to define, but one donors are comfortable with — has bought the left some time. Patrick's maiden voyage to New Hampshire found the candidate making exactly the pitch made by Biden, Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in early states, with the implicit argument that none of those candidates was running strong enough campaigns. At the state house, and during a visit to a cafe in Manchester, Patrick took questions about specific policies as cues to talk broadly about bringing the country together.

“I'm going to try to be a candidate with an ambitious agenda, but also some humility, because I think [no] one candidate, no one party has a corner and all the best ideas,” Patrick said in Concord. “As you draw on those ideas to sharpen and refine your own agenda, then I think we have not just a better chance of enacting that agenda, but having that agenda last.”

Over two long Q&As with reporters, Patrick previewed a campaign that could unleash more business-friendly money into the primary, something that could complicate the strategies of Biden et. al. while painting a bright target for the left. While Biden refused for years to endorse a super PAC on his behalf, Patrick said he would consider one right away.

“It'd be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” Patrick said. “I don't know what that is. I don't know where that will come from. And I wish it weren't so. I wish the campaigns weren't as expensive.”

That would leave Patrick and Biden as the only Democrats with super PACs, right before the expected start of a Bloomberg candidacy that would unleash tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising on behalf of another centrist. The idea for centrists is that Bloomberg or Patrick could offer an insurance policy in later-voting states if Biden fades; the read from more left-wing Democrats is that more easy targets are entering the race.

“It’s a really good thing for progressives that there are two transformative candidates speaking for the values of our movement,” said Joe Dinkin, a spokesman for the left-wing Working Families Party, which was pilloried by some on the left for endorsing Warren. “And it’s clear that the corporate-friendly candidates are in disarray.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

San Francisco District Attorney candidate Chesa Boudin speaks on Nov. 5. (Scott Strazzante/San Francisco Chronicle/AP)

The final elections of 2019 will happen Saturday, in Louisiana, where conservative Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards is seeking a second term and where Republicans could secure a legislative supermajority. Victories for the GOP would end a mixed but largely positive year for Republicans in red states — a win in North Carolina’s soon-to-be-redrawn 9th Congressional District, a near-sweep of Kentucky’s statewide offices, and none of the upsets that cost the party seats in 2017 or 2018.

Down the ballot, especially in big cities, 2019 has also been a banner year for the left. The scope of its wins became clear in only the past few days, as California and Washington counted more ballots. Chesa Boudin, a public defender whose parents went to prison for their role in an armed heist, came out ahead in the race for San Francisco district attorney — the biggest and most resonant win for criminal justice reformers since the 2017 election of Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner. In Seattle, left-wing candidates routed business-friendly challengers backed by Amazon. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

From state to state, left-wing organizing in sometimes sleepy local elections paid off. Republicans made more gains in rural areas, like southwest Pennsylvania, but continued to lose power in suburbs or cities; the exceptions, like Jacksonville, Fla., sometimes came where Democrats simply failed to compete. But where they organized, via everything from the Working Families Party to Democratic Socialists of America to Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio's “canary candidates” program, more left-wing candidates prevailed. A rundown:

Chicago: In April, socialist-backed candidates won a string of city council elections: Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Jeanette Taylor, Michael Rodriguez, Byron Sigcho-Lopez, Matt Martin, Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez, Andre Vasquez and Maria Hadden. The latter three unseated Democratic incumbents; all of them would go on to side with the city's teachers union in a fight with new Mayor Lori Lightfoot.

Denver: Candi CdeBaca, a self-described anarchist backed by the WFP, won a seat on the city council, joining disability rights activist Chris Hinds and formerly homeless activist Jamie Torres; in the city's school board elections, the left elected Tay Anderson and Brad Laurvick, backed by teachers unions. As Melanie Asmar wrote, the wins “could mean a departure from long-standing reform policies opposed by the union, including approving new independent charter schools and closing low-performing schools.”



Milwaukee: As in Denver, teacher-backed candidates swept races for the school board, even ousting the only incumbent who sought reelection.

Morgantown, W.Va.: The local branch of the Working Families Party elected seven city councilors in the college town that has become the bluest part of a very red state; one candidate, Zack Cruze, unseated an incumbent with a write-in campaign.

New York: Jumaane Williams prevailed in February's all-party race for public advocate; he won November's election, for the final two years in the job, by 56 points. Williams took over the job from now-Attorney General Letitia “Tish” James, two wins in a row for the left-wing WFP.



Phoenix: Carlos Garcia, an activist with the Puente Human Rights Movement (and campaigner against former Maricopa County Sherrif Joe Arpaio) won a seat on the city council.



Philadelphia: Left-wing incumbent city councilors such as Helen Gym won reelection; the Working Families Party, which took advantage of a law that requires two at-large council seats to be reserved for minor parties, ousted a Republican with city councilor-elect Kendra Brooks.

Seattle: Amazon's seven-figure intervention in city elections backfired dramatically, with even the incumbent city councilor who seemed most vulnerable — socialist Kshama Sawant — prevailing after late-arriving ballots were counted. Pro-labor, left-wing candidates now have a council supermajority and are considering whether to completely ban PAC donations by corporations that have foreign investors. If implemented, that would prevent another 2019-style intervention by Amazon.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Elizabeth Warren, “Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires.” Warren's campaign has run fewer ads than any close rival's — just one short cable buy in Iowa. Here, it's taking a page from Tom Steyer's “Need to Impeach” and running a spot only on a specific cable channel, to get a rise out of very specific viewers. (Steyer would hit Fox News; Warren is hitting CNBC.) The 60-second spot starts with Warren introducing her wealth tax then plays the complaints of four billionaires: Leon Cooperman, Joe Ricketts, Lloyd Blankfein and Peter Thiel.

John Delaney, “Real Solutions.” The first candidate to enter the race (28 months ago) will run his longest commercial — a 30-minute spot on Iowa TV markets, telling his business-to-politics biography and explaining why he entered the race. In it, he denounces “extreme partisanship,” pegging it as one of the main reasons he had to run: “How can 50 percent of the people be wrong 100 percent of the time?”

Pete Buttigieg, “Refreshing.” The Indiana mayor has continued to sharpen his criticism of Medicare-for-all legislation in TV spots. Criticism of the (unnamed) Democrats who want to replace private insurance with a single-payer plan is outsourced to Iowa voters. “We have to have people have the choice to keep their private health insurance or to go on the Medicare plan,” says one. “He seems sensible, not going to promise something that he cannot deliver,” says another.

Andrew Yang, “Paycheck.” One of Yang's first spots in New Hampshire returns to the original theme of his campaign, something emphasized a bit less in his other ads: the universal basic income of $1,000 per month.

POLL WATCH

2020 election in Pennsylvania (Muhlenberg, 410 registered voters)

Joe Biden — 53%

Donald Trump — 44%

Bernie Sanders — 50%

Donald Trump — 45%

Elizabeth Warren — 50%

Donald Trump — 45%

The latest Democratic panic was sparked by a New York Times-Siena poll that found every leading Democrat in a dead heat with the president in the three decisive 2016 states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Pennsylvania-based Muhlenberg poll finds each Democrat more clearly ahead of the president in the commonwealth, and at 50 percent. (Why that matters: Muhlenberg's final 2016 poll found a 44-to-40 lead for Clinton. She wound up with 47.5 percent of the vote, as a surge of undecideds for Trump and a scatter of third-party votes gave him a win with 48.2 percent.) Every Democrat is viewed more unfavorably than favorably, but not as much as Trump, or as Clinton, who was 25 points underwater in the final 2016 poll. Every Democrat loses white voters and by similar margins: Biden gets 46 percent of them, to 44 percent for Warren and Sanders. But Clinton won only 40 percent of those voters in 2016. With an electorate that resembled that year's, the president would be behind any challenger.

IN THE STATES

California. Cenk Uygur, the founder of the Young Turks liberal video network, appeared in paperwork for a candidacy in the state's 25th Congressional District — the one vacated this month by Democrat Katie Hill. Uygur declined to comment on the filing but promised an announcement on Thursday's prime-time show. Until now, Democrats in the swing seat, which has been trending blue, were consolidating around Assemblywoman Christy Smith.

Kentucky. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin conceded his race for a second term Thursday, nine days after losing to Democratic Attorney General Beshear. “We’re going to have a change in the governorship based on the vote of the people,” Bevin said at a news conference, as a recanvass, which he had asked for, was not finding any change in Beshear's 5,000 vote margin. “I’m not going to contest these numbers that have come in. It isn’t fair to throw that on our legislature.”

New York. Democrats got their first major recruit in the 2nd Congressional District, which is being vacated by Republican Rep. Peter King: city councilwoman and veteran Jackie Gordon. She got an endorsement from Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, as 2018 nominee Liuba Gretchen Shirley, who lost a sleeper race by six points, continues to consider the race.

Utah. Jon Huntsman, who left the governor's office to become ambassador to China, then left that office to run for president, is reportedly leaving his post as ambassador to Russia to seek the Republican nomination for governor again.

DEBATE SEASON

The qualifying period for the November Democratic debates has closed, and 10 candidates made it: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer. Only one candidate who qualified for last month's debate, and remains in the race, missed the cut: Julián Castro.

That wasn't a surprise, as polling had found Castro far below the 3 percent threshold. His hopes of hitting 4 percent in early states, another way to qualify, was also dashed: The race's only Latino candidate polled at 1 percent in the Nevada Independent's survey, the only one in that state before Wednesday's cutoff. Still, as of Thursday morning, a Facebook ad was still urging supporters to donate to Castro and help him make the stage.

“Quickly — NBC News just warned I could be cut from the next debates,” the ad read. “I need a massive surge of support to fund the ads I’ll need to spread my message and make the cut. Will you rush $15?”

Castro had already hit the 165,000 donation mark, the other metric for making the debates, which was irrelevant without the poll numbers. His campaign said that the Nov. 20 debate, co-sponsored by MSNBC and The Washington Post, would not determine whether the candidate still mattered.

“Whether it's immigration, police violence, housing, or other issues, Secretary Castro is shaping the debate, regardless of whether he's onstage,” said Castro spokesman Sawyer Hackett. “While the ground shifts under the front-runners, and billionaires buy their spot on stage, Secretary Castro is fighting for the most vulnerable communities, and telling truths other candidates are unwilling to speak.”

2020

The impeachment hearings have brought a temporary pause to the Medicare-for-all debate, which has sometimes consumed the Democratic primary. Supporters of the policy are raring to defend it, though; Data for Progress, which partners with YouGov Blue to ask about candidate and policy strength, recently tested three different descriptions of how the policy could be financed.

Asked whether they might support a ""tax on employers that requires them to pay for health care for every employee"" as Elizabeth Warren laid out this month, 47.6 percent of voters supported it, while 36.2 percent were opposed. Asked about a ""per-employee fee by employers to the Medicare system,"" 50.1 percent of voters were in favor, to 31.6 percent opposed. The least-popular option was a progressive tax starting on income above $29,000; 31.5 percent of voters supported it, to 51.7 percent opposed.

Joe Biden. He won the support of Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who ended his own presidential campaign last month. Ryan, 46, had run a shoestring campaign that pitched him as a living embodiment of the Rust Belt working class; in an interview with MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” Ryan said that Biden could win voters such as those -- ""blue-collar workers that we have to have if we’re going to beat Donald Trump."" Two months earlier, Ryan had told a Bloomberg News reporter that Biden was ""declining"" and might be a weak candidate in the fall; he never retracted those remarks, but never otherwise criticized Biden.

Cory Booker. He was endorsed by New Hampshire state Rep. Gerri Cannon, the first transgender member of the legislature, who was elected last year.

Andrew Yang. He introduced a series of tech reforms, including a “Department of the Attention Economy” which would regulate how distracting devices affect children, and a “Digital Bill of Rights” to help users retain control of their data.

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a Green New Deal for Public Housing, the first specific legislation to grow out of the nonbinding Green New Deal resolution, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, which would spend more than $170 billion to retrofit low-income housing. Meanwhile, an analysis by the left-wing magazine In These Times found that MSNBC, nominally the most liberal of the cable networks, had been more negative on Sanders than many other candidates.

Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign stepped up its billionaire-trolling effort with a new “Billionaire Tears” mug, commemorating a CNBC interview in which Leon Cooperman got weepy talking about her criticism of the extremely wealthy. “Savor a warm, slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union-made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do,” the campaign wrote.

THE BIG IDEA: When Donald Trump appeared on Steve Bannon’s radio show in December 2015, the then-Breitbart host asked his future boss how he’d approach Turkey if elected president.

“I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” Trump replied. “It’s called Trump Towers — two towers, instead of one. … And I’ve gotten to know Turkey very well. They’re amazing people. They’re incredible people. They have a strong leader.”

That “little conflict of interest” remains, and that “strong leader” is coming to the White House this afternoon.

President Trump is rolling out the red carpet for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan just weeks after his military incursion into northern Syria. By law, Trump is required to impose sanctions against Turkey for buying a Russian missile defense system. Before Erdogan took delivery in July, senior administration officials said it would be unacceptable and compromise the stealth capabilities of the new generation F-35 combat jet. But Trump has delayed sanctions and asked GOP senators for flexibility.

-- The president’s softness toward Turkey and his bromance with Erdogan is striking and, to some former Trump aides, suspicious. To wit: Former national security adviser John Bolton suggested during a private speech in Miami last week that the president’s approach to U.S. policy on Turkey is motivated by personal or financial interests, six people who were present for the remarks told NBC News.

“Bolton told the gathering of Morgan Stanley’s largest hedge fund clients that he was most frustrated with Trump over his handling of Turkey,” Stephanie Ruhle and Carol Lee report. “Noting the broad bipartisan support in Congress to sanction Turkey after [Erdogan] purchased a Russian missile defense system, Bolton said Trump’s resistance to the move was unreasonable … Bolton said he believes there is a personal or business relationship dictating Trump’s position on Turkey because none of his advisers are aligned with him on the issue.”

-- Erdogan, then prime minister, cut the ribbon at the opening of Trump Towers Istanbul in 2012. Trump was there with his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Both now work in the White House. The Trump Organization, which the president has never divested from, has received annual licensing fees for the use of the name on the skyscrapers.

-- Trump has offered Erdogan a package of inducements to improve U.S.-Turkey relations, which will be up for discussion today, that is virtually identical to those the administration proposed last month in a failed effort to stop Turkey’s invasion of Syria. Karen DeYoung, Missy Ryan and Kareem Fahim report on the proposal: “In a new letter to Erdogan last week, Trump told the Turkish president that a $100 billion trade deal, and a workaround to avoid U.S. sanctions over Turkey’s purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system, are still possible, senior administration officials said. The offer is likely to infuriate at least some of the overwhelming House majority that voted last month to impose sanctions on Turkey over its assault into Syria, and a bipartisan group of senators who introduced a similar bill. …

“In exchange for Trump’s revived offer, Erdogan would continue what the administration has said is its adherence to an Oct. 17 cease-fire agreement, negotiated with Vice President Pence a week after the invasion began, that limited the Turkish incursion. [There is dispute about the degree to which Erdogan has complied.] Turkey, a NATO [member], would also continue to actively support U.S. goals of preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State in Syria and establishing a stable and representative Syrian government. … Now, the administration’s red line is that the S-400s ‘do not become operational’ in a way that would allow them ‘access to our F-35 communications and defenses,’ said the senior official.”

-- Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army, a Turkish proxy force, has been accused of widespread abuses, including summary executions, beatings, kidnappings and looting in areas under Turkey’s control. “U.S. military officials watched live drone feeds in October that appeared to show Turkish-backed Arab gunmen targeting civilians during their assault on Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria, attacks the Americans reported to their commanders as possible war crimes,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. “U.S. surveillance videos of two incidents were included in an internal report compiled by State Department officials laying out concerns regarding four credible cases of alleged war crimes…”

After saying he wouldn’t tolerate such behavior, Erdogan has not cracked down on these Turkish-backed forces. In fact, he’s defended them. Margaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, has more about the ground truth in an op-ed for today’s paper: “As Erdogan visits the White House, remember the suffering in northern Syria.”

-- When the Turks want something from Trump, they go to Jared: “Behind President Trump’s accommodating attitude toward Turkey is an unusual back channel: a trio of sons-in-law who married into power and now play key roles in connecting Ankara with Washington,” the New York Times reports in a deep dive on the nexus of political and business interests. “One, Turkey’s finance minister, is the son-in-law of its strongman president and oversees his country’s relationship with the United States. Another is the son-in-law of a Turkish tycoon and became a business partner to the Trump Organization. Now he advocates for Turkey with the Trump administration. And the third is Jared Kushner, who as the son-in-law of and senior adviser to Mr. Trump has a vague if expansive foreign policy portfolio. Operating both individually and in tandem, the three men have developed an informal, next-generation line of communication…

“Mr. Erdogan predicted in a television interview this year that a private dialogue between Berat Albayrak, his [41-year-old] son-in-law and finance minister, and Mr. Kushner would soon put ‘back on track’ the vexed relations … ‘The bridge works well in this manner,’ Mr. Erdogan said. ‘Backdoor diplomacy,’ Mr. Albayrak called his work with Mr. Kushner. … On the Russian missiles, banking sanctions and other matters, Mr. Erdogan has deployed both his own son-in-law and Mr. Trump’s Turkish business partner, Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, as emissaries to the administration, sometimes through Mr. Kushner … In April, for example, Mr. Albayrak had come to Washington for a conference organized by Mr. Yalcindag at the Trump International Hotel. And in the middle of the event, Mr. Kushner summoned Mr. Albayrak to an impromptu meeting in the Oval Office, where Mr. Albayrak successfully pressed Mr. Trump to hold back the sanctions against Turkey for buying Russian weapons. …

“On the strength of his ties to the Trump family, Mr. Erdogan also named Mr. Yalcindag to a new role as chairman of a state-run business group that lobbies Washington on behalf of Ankara. The group’s previous chairman, Ekim Alptekin, had run afoul of American prosecutors by paying more than $500,000 to the consulting firm of the retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who went on to become Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser. … Taking over as the face of the state-sponsored Turkey-U.S. Business Council after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Yalcindag began to travel regularly to Washington. The council for the first time held its annual conferences at the Trump hotel in Washington, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue for the hotel while pulling in top Trump administration officials as speakers.”

-- In a sentencing memo last December, former special counsel Bob Mueller’s team of prosecutors outlined more of the secretive activities Flynn undertook to help Turkey while advising the Trump campaign in 2016.

-- Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, also has interests in Turkey. Philip Bump explained some of the backstory recently: “Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) thought he was talking to Turkey’s minister of defense [in August]. … It was a Russian radio host who has earned a reputation for getting foreign officials on the phone and eliciting information under false pretenses as he did in two calls with Graham. … In the second conversation, Graham touts his access to Trump by claiming to have spent significant time with the president over the previous weekend in which they discussed Turkey. … ‘This case involving the Turkish bank?’ Graham said. ‘He’s very sensitive. The president wants to be helpful within the limits of his power.’ He mentioned it again a bit later, describing his conversations with Trump during their interactions. …

“It appears to be a reference to a criminal case in the United States focused on a man named Reza Zarrab. Zarrab was at the center of an effort to help Iran evade international sanctions by masking money transfers into the country as sales of gold. After being arrested in the United States in 2016, Zarrab agreed to work with prosecutors, providing testimony against an official from a Turkish state bank, Halkbank. That official was found guilty in January 2018. In late 2017, Zarrab also directly implicated Erdogan, suggesting that the then-prime minister had approved the scheme. Shortly after Zarrab was arrested, Erdogan pressured the Obama administration to release him — and to fire the U.S. attorney who brought charges against Zarrab, Preet Bharara. Trump fired Bharara in March 2017. …

“Zarrab himself has been represented by two attorneys whose names might be familiar to Americans: Michael Mukasey, a former attorney general, and [Giuliani]. The pair even met with Erdogan in early 2017, reportedly to try to resolve the Zarrab case. At some point that year, Trump directly tried to intervene. With Giuliani and Mukasey in the room, Trump reportedly asked then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to try to get the Justice Department to drop the case against Zarrab. The president also suggested he speak with Giuliani about the case. Tillerson refused. … That Graham focused on the ‘case involving the Turkish bank’ — Halkbank — after apparently spending time with Trump at his club in Bedminster in August suggests that the Zarrab affair may still be at the forefront of Trump’s concerns in regard to Turkey. It also suggests another situation where, like Ukraine, Trump may be following Giuliani’s lead.”

-- The run of show: As most of us are watching the first televised impeachment inquiry hearing, Trump is scheduled to welcome Erdogan at the South Portico of the White House at noon. The presidents will be joined for 20 minutes by their wives, and then they will talk for 30 minutes in “a restricted bilateral meeting” in the Oval Office before going to the Cabinet Room for an expanded working lunch. Trump and Erdogan are scheduled to hold a joint news conference at 3:10 p.m. in the East Room, and then Erdogan is set to depart the White House just before 4 p.m.

-- Some prominent liberals are pressing House Democrats to expand the scope of the impeachment inquiry to include Trump Organization dealings overseas, with Turkey near the top of the list. “The Constitution is clear: The founders were deadly afraid foreign governments would get their hooks into high-ranking American officials, especially the president,” said Jeff Hauser, the executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic Policy and Research. “Trump's policies and team have tilted toward Turkey at key junctures over the past three years, and it is Congress’s constitutional responsibility to determine if that's because Trump is as financially entangled with Turkey as Flynn and Giuliani.”

Democratic leaders are eager to wrap up the impeachment process as early as possible in 2020 so they can pivot to pocketbook issues. That’s kept the probe narrowly focused and meant a range of potential Trump misconduct is not being seriously scrutinized. Hauser and other thought leaders on the left warn that this is a mistake. “By shouting that impeachment rests on the Ukraine story alone, House Democrats risk undermining their constitutional responsibilities to safeguard the executive branch from foreign entanglements,” he told me. “The only reliable way to assess Turkey's seeming influence over Trump is for the House to subpoena all relevant Trump Organizational records. The Trump Organization is not ‘the presidency,’ and there is no risk of any remotely serious claim of executive privilege.”

-- Another fresh reminder of the president’s financial entanglements overseas: The Trump Organization has agreed to pay $290,000 to the Scottish government, ending a multiyear legal battle in which Trump tried and failed to block an offshore wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses. “The agreement to pay the government’s legal fees ends the company’s bitter public dispute with the Scottish government. Over the years, Trump repeatedly criticized former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond about the wind farm and warned that it would cause ‘almost total destruction’ of the country’s tourism industry,” Joshua Partlow reports. “A Scottish government spokesman said that the settlement — first reported by the Scotsman newspaper — removed the need for an independent auditor to determine expenses to be paid by the Trump Organization. … The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.”

-- At least seven people were killed, including five children, and 10 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded near the Kabul airport this morning.

THE LATEST ON THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:

-- Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate who has been indicted for campaign finance violations, says he discussed Ukraine with the president during an exclusive donor dinner in Trump’s Washington hotel. Rosalind S. Helderman, Matt Zapotosky, Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey report: “Parnas, has described to associates that he and his business partner, Igor Fruman, told Trump at the dinner that they thought the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was unfriendly to the president and his interests. According to Parnas, the president reacted strongly to the news: Trump immediately suggested that then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who had been in the Foreign Service for 32 years and served under Democratic and Republican presidents, should be fired, people familiar with his account said. … Parnas’s account of personally discussing Ukraine with Trump more than 18 months ago suggests that he and Fruman had more personal interaction with the president — and potentially more influence over his views on that country — than the White House has acknowledged. … Parnas’s account of the 2018 dinner is the first indication that he or Fruman interacted directly with Trump about Ukraine. His description of their conversation suggests that the Boca Raton businessman, who emigrated as a child from Ukraine, could hold key information about Trump’s pressure campaign on his home country — an effort that set in motion the ongoing impeachment inquiry.”

-- Aides are warning Trump not to fire acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Carol D. Leonnig, Tom Hamburger, Josh Dawsey and John Hudson report: “Senior advisers have cautioned Trump that removing Mulvaney at such a sensitive time could be perilous ... both because Mulvaney played an integral role in the decision to freeze the aid, and because of the disruption that would be caused by replacing one of Trump’s most senior aides. ‘I don’t think you’ll see him going anywhere until after December,’ said one Trump adviser ... ‘But the president was very unhappy with that press conference. That was a very bad day for the president.’ … Mulvaney’s relationship with Trump garnered new scrutiny Tuesday when he called off plans to file a lawsuit asking the courts to rule on whether he should comply with a House subpoena to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Instead he announced he would follow the president’s broad directive barring aides from participating in the inquiry.”­

-- Get to know the lawyers you will see on television today:

The lead Democratic counsel, Daniel S. Goldman, cut his teeth by sending mobsters, stock swindlers and inside traders to prison. Devlin Barrett reports: “At the public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee due to begin Wednesday, Goldman is slotted to question each witness for 45 minutes, followed by five-minute question sessions for each lawmaker. Stephen R. Castor, general counsel for the House Oversight Committee, will be the Republicans’ point man. The format is a significant departure from routine congressional hearings, where lawmakers have the spotlight and seldom cede the microphone and live television coverage to a staffer. By assigning a big chunk of the questioning to a committee lawyer, and in Goldman’s case, an accomplished former prosecutor, party leaders are tacitly acknowledging just how serious the stakes are.”

Castor, the lead Republican staff attorney, has served as an investigator in some of the biggest House probes of the last 15 years, including inquiries related to Hurricane Katrina and the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Elise Viebeck reports: “Castor will help lead the effort as general counsel for the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In contrast with his Democratic counterpart … Castor has spent his career avoiding the media spotlight, rising through the ranks over nearly 15 years and seven consecutive chairmanships to become the Oversight panel’s top GOP lawyer. Castor declined to comment for this report, but a half-dozen former colleagues and bosses praised him as a straight-shooting attorney whose deliberate, low-key style will make him an asset to Republicans...""

-- For Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and today’s first public witness, everything has been easy compared to Vietnam, per a Yahoo profile: “Taylor served in the 101st Airborne’s 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry, and for a year commanded 20 to 30 men in his rifle platoon on the front lines of the conflict, in the Quang Tri and Thua Tien provinces of what was then South Vietnam. … After a year, Taylor was eligible to return home to the U.S. Instead, he signed up to stay another six months, was promoted to captain, and became commander of Alpha Company. … Taylor was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Air Medal. He left the military in 1975 and went on to work in senior positions at the newly created Department of Energy and then on the staff of Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J. In the 1990s, Taylor oversaw U.S. assistance to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the years immediately following the fall of the Iron Curtain. ... Taylor spent a few years working in Afghanistan, Iraq and on the Middle East peace process. In 2006, he returned to Eastern Europe as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.""

-- Taylor published an op-ed in a Ukrainian newspaper reaffirming U.S. support for the country: “The United States is firmly committed to Ukraine’s success – your success is our success. We will not allow Russia to dismantle the international order that was painstakingly built after World War II,"" he wrote earlier this week. ""President [Volodomyr] Zelenskyy’s administration and the Verkhovna Rada have taken solid steps toward meaningful judicial reform, including the reboot of key anti-corruption institutions that give teeth to the rule of law and other fundamental reforms. … But as everyone who promotes democracy knows, strengthening and protecting democratic values is a constant process, requiring persistence and steady work by both officials and ordinary citizens. As in all democracies, including the United States, work remains in Ukraine, especially to strengthen rule of law and to hold accountable those who try to subvert Ukraine’s structures to serve their personal aims, rather than the nation’s interests.”

-- Taylor and George Kent are in the hot seat today. Marie Yovanovitch, the deposed ex-ambassador, comes to the Capitol on Friday. And eight more witnesses are scheduled to testify in public hearings next week. Democrats announced this lineup last night:

Tuesday: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the European affairs director at the National Security Council; Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine; Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to Mike Pence who listened to the July 25 call; and Timothy Morrison, the former senior director for Russian affairs at the NSC.

Wednesday: Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union; Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine; and David Hale, the State Department’s under secretary for political affairs.

Thursday: Fiona Hill, the former top Russia adviser on the NSC.

-- In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Giuliani lays out an impeachment defense for Trump: “The conversation my client … had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 was innocent. ... For Messrs. Trump and Zelensky to discuss these issues was not only proper but an exercise of Mr. Trump’s responsibility as U.S. president as expressed in Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution: ‘to take care that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed.’ Moreover, Mr. Trump requested that Ukraine root out corruption; he didn’t demand it. His words were cordial, agreeable and free of any element of threat or coercion. Mr. Trump offered nothing in return to Ukraine for cleaning up corruption.""

-- Giuliani was negotiating a deal to co-produce a podcast with The Hill and writer John Solomon, a central figure in the disinformation campaign against Joe Biden. From ProPublica: “The project, which never came to fruition for unclear reasons, featured the former New York City mayor interviewing various public figures. The emails include recordings of lengthy chats with the commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, and a retired Marine Corps general named James T. Conway. The Conway interview largely concerned MEK, the dissident Iranian group that the United States had designated a terrorist group until 2012. MEK has paid Giuliani at least $20,000 for appearances and lobbying on its behalf.""

-- History will judge: Even if Senate Republicans don't convict Trump, as expected, the GOP will pay a reputational price for a generation, writes Politico co-founder John F. Harris. “Most Republicans do not face a high cost within their own party for defending Trump. But, in a country becoming younger and more diverse, there’s little chance even these internal GOP politics remain static. The isolationists of the 1930s had the popular position at the time, but had considerable explaining to do for years after. So did the McCarthy backers of the 1950s. So did the civil rights opponents of the 1960s. Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri is 39. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas is 42. There is every reason to suppose they and other ascendant Republicans will be answering ‘what did you do in the Trump years?’ for decades to come.”

ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN:

-- Did Trump perjure himself in his answers to former special counsel Bob Mueller? Roger Stone’s trial has shown that the self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" was the linchpin of a months-long effort by Trump’s 2016 campaign to discover damaging information on Hillary Clinton to be released by WikiLeaks, an effort that began before the hack of Democratic emails was publicly known. Someone is not telling the truth about what the president knew and when he knew it.

“Testimony over four days ending Tuesday also revealed engagement by Trump and top aides in making use of Stone’s claims that he knew emails detrimental to Clinton’s campaign would be released,” Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Matt Zapotosky report. “The trial in federal court in Washington turns on accusations that Stone lied to Congress about his attempts to learn more about what WikiLeaks would publish and when it would do so. But some testimony also raises questions about the president’s written assertions under oath that he did not recall being aware of communications between Stone and WikiLeaks or recall any conversations about WikiLeaks between Stone and members of his campaign.” The White House declined to comment.

“Rick Gates, who served as Trump’s deputy campaign chairman, testified Tuesday that Stone began discussing Clinton leaks with the campaign in April 2016 and that from May onward Gates understood Stone to be the campaign’s intermediary with WikiLeaks. By July 2016, Gates testified, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said he was updating Trump and others regularly and directed Gates to keep following up with Stone. After Trump ended one phone call from Stone at the end of that month, Gates testified, the future president said to Gates that ‘more information would be coming.’ … Gates said Stone also asked for contact information for … Jared Kushner and political director Jim Murphy to brief them on the Democratic emails, which U.S. authorities concluded were hacked by Russia.

“After WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in July that he had more Clinton emails ‘pending publication,’ Gates said Manafort told him to stay in touch with Stone about future releases. Manafort, Gates testified, ‘would be updating other people on the campaign, including the candidate.’ … Despite what Gates said was skepticism about Stone’s reliability, he testified that he and other top campaign staffers, including Manafort, spokesman Jason Miller and adviser Stephen Miller, held ‘brainstorming sessions’ based on what Stone told them.” Closing arguments are scheduled for 1 p.m. today.

-- Trump has considered firing Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community’s inspector general, because he reported the whistleblower’s complaint to Congress after concluding that it was credible. From the Times: “The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal … It is unclear how far Mr. Trump’s discussions about removing Mr. Atkinson have progressed. Two people familiar with what took place said they thought that Mr. Trump was just venting, and insisted that Mr. Atkinson’s dismissal was never under serious consideration. … Inspectors general are supposed to be insulated from politics so they can follow the facts and provide oversight of the executive branch. While presidents have the authority to remove them, they are supposed to take that action only in cases of misconduct or failure to fulfill duties. … People close to the president believe the political consequences of firing Mr. Atkinson could be devastating, especially when Mr. Trump needs all the Republican support he can get for a potential impeachment trial in the Senate.”

-- The Justice Department's inspector general has begun scheduling times for witnesses to review draft sections of his report on the FBI’s investigation of Trump’s 2016 campaign. This is an indication that the document will soon be released publicly. Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report: “Several witnesses have been scheduled or are in talks to review sections of the report dealing with their testimony in the next two weeks, the people said on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. That could mean public release is imminent, though the witnesses will be allowed to submit feedback — which could spark more investigative work and slow down the process. The particulars for each witness’s review were not immediately clear and in some cases were still being negotiated. The inspector general’s office will probably offer relatively short windows for witnesses to submit feedback and take other steps to prevent leaks, as it often does in sensitive and high-profile cases.”

-- Leaked emails from White House senior adviser Stephen Miller show him promoting white nationalism, far-right extremist ideas and anti-immigrant rhetoric, according to a new report released by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Kim Bellaware reports that this is the first installment in a series that draws on more than 900 emails that Miller sent to a Breitbart writer over a 15-month period between 2015 and 2016 and were given to the SPLC: ""The report describes Miller’s emails as overwhelmingly focused on race and immigration and characterizes him as obsessed with ideas such as ‘white genocide’ (a conspiracy theory associated with white supremacists) and sharply curbing nonwhite immigration. … At least one member of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called for Miller to resign. … White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said via email that she had not seen the report but called the SPLC ‘an utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization.’ ‘They are beneath public discussion, even in The Washington Post,’ Grisham said of the civil rights nonprofit. …

""SPLC’s report indicates Miller was widely successful in molding the race- and immigration-focused stories that appeared on Breitbart. It repeatedly details how an email from Miller corresponded to a related article later appearing on the site. The emails were provided to the SPLC by Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart writer and editor who exchanged scores of messages with Miller.” Read the full report here.

-- Violent hate crimes reached a 16-year high in 2018, the FBI said. From the Times: “Over all, the number of hate crimes of all kinds reported in the United States remained fairly flat last year after a three-year increase, according to an annual F.B.I. report. But while crimes against property were down, physical assaults against people were up, accounting for 61 percent of the 7,120 incidents classified as hate crimes by law enforcement officials nationwide. … The F.B.I. said there were 4,571 reported hate crimes against people in 2018, many of them in America’s largest cities, involving victims from a wide range of ethnic and religious backgrounds. … Immigration has replaced terrorism as a top concern in the United States, according to national surveys. That shift appears to be reflected in the hate-crime data, which shows fewer attacks against Muslims and Arab-Americans in recent years, but more against Latinos. The F.B.I. said 485 hate crimes against Latinos were reported in 2018, up from 430 in 2017. It said 270 crimes were reported against Muslims and Arab-Americans, the fewest since 2014.”

-- Mina Chang, who used to run a small nonprofit, embellished her résumé, falsely claimed she addressed the Republican and Democratic national conventions and even went as far as fabricating a Time magazine cover with herself on it. Somehow she landed a plum political appointment at the State Department. Chang joined the State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations as a deputy assistant secretary in April. At some point, she was in consideration for a higher position, but her nomination was withdrawn without explanation. “In her State Department biography, which appears to include the same photograph used in the doctored Time cover, Chang claims that she is ‘an alumna of the Harvard Business School’ who has ‘addressed the Republican and Democratic National Conventions,'"" Reis Thebault reports. ""Chang did complete a program at Harvard, but one very different from the prestigious institution’s master of business administration degree. … The Advanced Management Program has open enrollment. As long as an applicant’s employer sponsors them, and the firm can meet certain standards and foot the $82,000 fee, the person is admitted.”

-- Thanks largely to the two justices installed by Trump, the Supreme Court sounds ready to let the president get rid of legal protections for 700,000 ""dreamers."" Robert Barnes reports on oral arguments: ""The Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the program shielding young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children should end regardless of its legality, and the court’s dominant conservative justices showed no inclination to disagree. … It is one of the court’s most important cases of the term, and the court’s four liberal justices indicated the administration had not met requirements for ending a program with such dire consequences for the immigrants and the economy. But they did not appear to find support from the court’s conservatives, who reserved their toughest questions for those challenging the administration’s actions.

""Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., perhaps the pivotal member of the court, gave no indication that he found the administration’s actions troublesome or unusual. But questioning at oral arguments is not always predictive, and the decision in the case might not come for months. ... The Trump administration moved to scuttle the DACA program in 2017 ... [Jeff] Sessions said that the program could not be defended, basing his decision on a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which said that another Obama program protecting undocumented immigrants was beyond the president’s powers. The Supreme Court deadlocked 4 to 4 in 2016 when considering the issue.""

These are the two men who have joined the court since then: Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted during yesterday's oral arguments that “there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy.” Justice Neil Gorsuch wondered whether courts have a role in reviewing the judgments of the attorney general and homeland security secretary: “What more would you have the government say?” he asked.

-- Jared Kushner and other senior administration officials are planning on setting up web cameras to live-stream the construction of Trump’s border wall, going against the advice of experts. Nick Miroff reports: “Kushner floated the idea during meetings in July, part of a messaging effort to push back against criticism that Trump has failed to deliver on the signature proposal of his 2016 campaign. The Army Corps and CBP have told Kushner that construction contractors do not want their proprietary techniques visible to competitors … Officials at the Army Corps and CBP also were concerned the cameras would show U.S. work crews violating Mexican sovereignty because they sometimes must stray south of the border to maneuver their vehicles and heavy equipment in the desert. Because some of the remote border areas lack network access, the cameras will require their own web connectivity and attendants who could frequently reposition them to keep the lens pointed at the action. Kushner has continued to press forward with the 24-hour-wall-cam idea anyway, viewing the feeds as a crucial part of the administration’s effort to demonstrate irrefutable evidence of progress.”

-- Trump told a crowd at the Economic Club of New York that his daughter Ivanka, Jared's wife, has personally created 14 million new jobs. Yes, that’s a ridiculous number. From New York Magazine: “The entire U.S. economy has created fewer than 6 million new jobs since Trump took office. So Trump is crediting his daughter with having personally created more than 200 percent of all new jobs in the United States. This is like supply-side economics but for authoritarian nepotism. Exactly how she did this remains a subject of some confusion. The mechanism involves the ‘Pledge to America’s Workers,’ in which the chief executives of various firms promise to create some arbitrary number of training and other opportunities. … Last October, Ivanka claimed this initiative had created 6.3 million jobs. … Some of the companies that contributed to this number … admitted they had simply credited all real (or, in some cases, hypothetical) job openings to the Ivanka initiative.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Hillary Clinton claimed that “many, many, many people” are urging her to run for president in 2020 and refused to close the door to an 11th-hour entry. ""Never say never,"" she told BBC Radio. Felicia Sonmez and Robert Costa report: “Advisers to Clinton have said at various times over the past year that she is unwilling to completely shut the door to a potential 2020 bid. … In the Tuesday radio interview, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked by host Emma Barnett about her future plans. Clinton replied that she wants to see President Trump ‘retired’ and is ‘going to be helping our side try to put together the strongest possible campaign, which will be difficult.’ ‘Are you going to run again?’ Barnett asked. ‘No,’ Clinton replied. ‘Not, no. I’m –’ ‘That is 100 percent?’ the host continued. ‘So in a few days, I’m not going to open my newspaper –’ ‘Well, you know, I’d never say never to anything,’ Clinton said.”

-- Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford ended his primary challenge against Trump, blaming the impeachment drama for making it impossible to discuss his substantive policy differences with the president. David Weigel and Colby Itkowitz report: “Sanford, who launched his protest campaign two months ago, announced his decision during a news conference in New Hampshire. He had been planning to file in the early-primary state Friday. ‘You’ve got to be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ Sanford said. ‘All of the oxygen is leaving the room — in terms of meaningful debate, on what comes next in our country on a whole host of issues.’ Sanford, 59, who was a rare Trump critic among Republicans in Congress, lost his congressional seat last year after a pro-Trump challenger accused him of being disloyal to the president. … With the Republican Party unified around Trump, he was unable to gain any real traction or attention. As he exited the race, Sanford lambasted the ‘atrocious’ way Republicans in South Carolina and some other states had restricted or canceled their Republican primaries to pave the way for Trump. ‘I don’t think we want to get our cues on electoral participation from North Korea,’ he said.”

-- Former Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan endorsed Biden for president. ""America can’t afford a president who jeopardizes the success and dignity of its workers to make himself feel tough,"" the Ohio congressman said in a statement released by Biden's campaign.

-- The Biden campaign also released the names of 133 foreign policy officials who’ve endorsed the former vice president. Josh Rogin writes: “The list of endorsers also reinforces Biden’s call for a return to a more centrist, traditional foreign policy — not a progressive break from the norm ... Many of the new endorsers were senior national security officials in the Obama-Biden administration and have had ties to Biden for many years, including former national security adviser Tom Donilon, former undersecretary of state Nick Burns, former deputy CIA director Avril Haines, former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco and Biden’s former national security advisers Jake Sullivan and Colin Kahl. Many of these officials are prepared to be public surrogates for the Biden campaign and can testify to his specific actions and accomplishments on foreign policy, not only as vice president, but also as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman for years before that.”

-- Pete Buttigieg wants to build a bridge to the religious right, but tensions with his husband's family -- who don't approve of homosexuality -- highlight just how difficult that could be. Amy B Wang reports: “The split is resonating even more since [his husband,] Chasten, a 30-year-old former schoolteacher, has attracted his own enthusiastic following and begun holding solo campaign events separate from Buttigieg. … The Glezman family’s strains erupted several months ago when Chasten told The Post about his childhood in Michigan and his anxiety about coming out in high school … The article quoted Chasten saying of his brothers, ‘We never got over it,’ and Rhyan adding, ‘I just don’t support the gay lifestyle.’ The next day, Rhyan woke up to dozens of messages calling him a bigot, a homophobe and worse. ‘It kind of blindsided me,’ Rhyan said. … In Rhyan’s telling, their parents were in fact very supportive of Chasten, and it was Rhyan who got the cold shoulder when he announced he was giving himself to Jesus. … The Buttigieg campaign declined requests for Chasten to comment for this article, but emphasized that Rhyan Glezman does not speak for the family.”

-- Before Elizabeth Warren became a Democrat, her political worldview was shaped by her time at Rutgers and the University of Pennsylvania. From the Philadelphia Inquirer: “Many of her former classmates say Warren’s time at the liberal hotbed in North Jersey must have influenced the politics she now embraces. … ‘It was an exciting time to be studying law in terms of people who really wanted to make change,’ said Mimi Marchev, who … entered Rutgers with Warren in 1973. ‘That was sort of the tenor of the place. It wasn’t a feeder into corporate law.’ … Interviews with more than a dozen of Warren’s classmates, teachers, colleagues, and students, along with a review of yearbooks, Penn archives, and Warren’s legal writing, revealed how the two institutions influenced her and offered early glimpses of defining traits she now uses to drive a campaign around big and politically risky policy plans. … Classmates remember ‘Liz’ as smart, energetic, and laser-focused, a necessity for balancing classes with being a mother and homemaker. Driving to Newark in a blue Volkswagen Beetle, she would bring her lunch, and occasionally her young daughter, Amelia. If friends couldn’t watch Amelia, Warren would bring her to class.”

“That might be a strategy,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said with a coy smile when asked about the possibility of a trial that disrupts the Democratic campaign. “But I’ll leave that up to others. I’m just a lowly worker.”

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a McConnell ally, said the Senate would try to distinguish itself during impeachment “by doing this right,” with a trial that probably lasts five or six weeks. But he acknowledged the timing could have an effect on the campaign by giving a potential boost to presidential candidates who have no official role in the process.

“Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden might like that,” Cornyn said of the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and the former vice president, who now poll in the top four in Iowa with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

AD

There is an emerging divide among Republicans, however, over timing. While some Republicans favor a lengthy trial as a means of defending President Trump and creating problems for Democrats, others are calling for swift dismissal or final vote.

AD

The Democratic senators who remain in the presidential race have all said publicly that the impeachment proceedings are more important than political concerns. But advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes, and Sanders has spoken about the potential challenges of an extended trial if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump and sends the case to the Senate.

“We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to,” Sanders said Sunday at an event in Charles City, Iowa, when asked about a potential trial in January. “But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult.”

AD

Warren said Wednesday that she has “constitutional responsibilities” and “if the House goes forward and sends impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.”

AD

One top adviser to a senator running for president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy, said the campaign was already rearranging fundraising and campaign schedules to prepare for a trial.

“We’ve been all but told that January is when we should expect not to have them,” the person said. “And that in December is when we should expect to have them.”

The issue of trial length came up during a closed-door lunch of all GOP senators Wednesday, when Republicans speculated about whether the House would hand over the process to them either before or after Christmas, according to multiple people in attendance.

AD

Inside the lunch, McConnell had little guidance for his ranks, outside of saying the trial will go on as long as the Senate wants it to run, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details from the private meeting.

AD

But McConnell’s deputies, as well as most of his ranks, believe a longer trial is the likelier outcome — which they say would give Trump and his defense team sufficient time to make his case.

Cornyn said Wednesday that it would be difficult to find a majority in the Senate to dismiss the trial early on, even if the president’s attorneys request it, “before the evidence is presented.”

“I think the consensus in our conference is at least that we need to proceed and take seriously the responsibility we have,” said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the second-ranking Senate Republican. “How long that takes is an open question . . . but I suspect that, you know, it’d go on for a while.”

AD

Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who has speculated publicly that a Senate trial could run as long as eight weeks, argued during the lunch that former president Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings in the Senate took five weeks but that Trump’s case was likely to take more time because he has not admitted to any wrongdoing.

AD

Clinton “admitted that he had lied to the FBI,” Burr said before the lunch. “I figured it’s going to take longer for them to make a case, because they don’t have that.”

One White House official said the president is not yet concentrating on a trial but has spoken with McConnell, Vice President Pence and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, about the outlook in the chamber. Newly hired White House aides who are working on impeachment issues have also been meeting with Senate GOP staffers this month.

AD

McConnell has not publicly committed to a timeline for a trial. “I think it’s impossible to predict how long we’ll be on it or predict which motions would pass,” the GOP leader said Wednesday.

But McConnell will not be able to set the schedule in isolation. The rules for an impeachment trial, including a process for calling witnesses, must be passed by 51 or more senators, since Pence is not able to cast a deciding vote on the question. That gives McConnell, who oversees a 53-seat Republican majority, relatively little room to maneuver.

AD

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has been a sharp critic of Trump’s behavior on Ukraine, and more independent-minded senators, like Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), could side with Democrats to force a process that Democrats accept as fair, according to a person familiar with Republican discussions.

AD

A separate group of centrist Senate Republicans facing tough reelection fights next year have been telling McConnell and colleagues that they do not want the process to be rushed, worrying that any move to quickly dispense with a trial risks giving their Democratic opponents an opening to say they did not take their duties seriously.

That view has been bolstered by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who has privately told conservative colleagues they must give breathing room to Republicans running in 2020 and let the trial play out for at least a few weeks, according to two Republican aides briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.

AD

“This is going to require a great deal of work, and I don’t think it should be rushed through,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is up for reelection in 2020. Collins said any attempt to dismiss impeachment at the outset of a trial would be met with vocal opposition by a “lot of senators, who’d have misgivings and reservations about treating articles of impeachment that way.”

AD

On the other hand, several Trump allies are planning to prepare a motion to dismiss that they could propose early on during a trial.

“The sooner we’re done with this, the better,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “Why just have people sitting around for this partisan sham? As soon as we possibly can dismiss this or vote along party lines, especially if the Democrats in the House limit the witnesses, I’ll move to do that.”

AD

Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) also dismissed the prospect of a lengthy trial, saying a “week is more than enough.”

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been talking with Democratic senators, including those running for president, to decide the best way to approach any negotiation with McConnell about whether Democrats join in a resolution setting up the Senate process.

“Given articles of impeachment haven’t even been drafted, it’s impossible to know what either side would want a trial to look like,” said a person familiar with Schumer’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. Schumer declined Wednesday to discuss his next steps but warned that a trial should not be “truncated.”

McConnell’s general template remains the Senate impeachment trial of Clinton in early 1999, which lasted five weeks and had a bipartisan consensus at its start about how it would proceed, according to McConnell’s aides and allies.

Discussions on Senate rules in 1999 broke down repeatedly before the chamber finally agreed on a compromise by a margin of 100-to-0.

An initial proposal by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) to make a full trial contingent on a two-thirds supermajority finding Clinton’s alleged offenses impeachable faced fierce objection from Republicans.

“When I presented it to the Republican conference, they did everything but stone me and throw me out in the hall,” said former senator Trent Lott (Miss.), who was then the Republican leader.

A compromise was reached later in a closed-door meeting for all senators in the Old Senate Chamber, when Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) agreed they should start the trial before deciding whether witnesses would be called before the full body.

Lott said McConnell and Schumer might have a more challenging time striking a deal.

“This is a different situation,” he said. “You do have a divided Congress. You do have a president who has agitated a lot of people.”"

Environmental activists have repeatedly asked Democrats running for president to reject donations from fossil-fuel executives. So how will they — and the rest of the Democratic base — react to a former oil executive jumping into the race?

That’s the question raised by Deval Patrick’s sudden 2020 candidacy. The former Massachusetts governor made it official this morning by releasing a YouTube video (see below), saying his nascent presidential bid is about “the character of the country.”

But Patrick may soon be faced with questions about his time in the oil business as Democratic voters, especially young ones, express heightened concern about climate change. His long career in the private sector before becoming the state’s first black governor includes a stint at a top executive at Texaco, once one of the nation’s biggest oil companies.

That and other résumé lines could come back to haunt Patrick as he enters a Democratic race increasingly defined by what ranges from deep skepticism to outright hostility of big corporations and the oil and natural gas sector in particular for its contributions to climate change. Patrick is currently managing director at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm co-founded by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

“We don’t think he has any chance,” said Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at Oil Change U.S., one of several green groups pressing 2020 candidates to forgo donations from fossil-fuel executives. “It’s pretty laughable.”

Weighing against that private-sector job is Patrick’s long record as governor in which the state accelerated its adoption of renewable energy and joined the nation’s first cap-and-trade program for cutting carbon dioxide emissions.

The two-term governor, who has close ties to former president Barack Obama and his network of advisers, emphasized in his announcement his days growing up poor on South Side of Chicago rather than his time in the corporate boardroom.

But Patrick’s decision to abruptly join the crowded Democratic field, along with former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s plans to likely do the same, is yet another sign of anxiety among business-minded Democrats as Massachusetts’s own Elizabeth Warren, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), call for taxing the ultrarich.

Patrick began working with Texaco in 1997 to lead a task force meant to address its racially biased employment practices. The task force was formed as part of a $176.1 million settlement with the Harrison, N.Y.-based firm’s black employees, in what was at the time the largest racial discrimination lawsuit in U.S. history.

By the next year, Patrick was named the general counsel and vice president of the oil giant. As the company’s top lawyer, he helped shepherd a deal valued at $45 billion in 2001 merging Texaco with Chevron to form the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded oil company.

Unwilling to move to the San Francisco headquarters of the new company (called ChevronTexaco until 2005 when the name became Chevron), Patrick left for a job at Coca-Cola in 2001.

By the time he became governor six years later, Patrick was pursuing energy and environmental policies sometimes at odds with the interests of the oil and gas industry of which he was once part.

Patrick spearheaded the passage of laws and regulations encouraging homeowners and businesses to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and dramatically expanding solar energy, at times weathering criticism such policies were driving up energy costs. And under the Patrick administration, Massachusetts became one of nine states to join a market-capping carbon emissions from power plants, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

The result: Massachusetts is consistently ranked as the nation's most energy-efficient state in an analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. And despite its tiny landmass and long winters, Massachusetts has the eighth-highest total solar capacity in the country.

“It went from being a state that wasn't even on the map in terms of solar to being No. 8,” said Ian Bowles, who served as Patrick's secretary of energy and environmental affairs from 2007 to 2011. He added that the Patrick administration's policies “really positioned Massachusetts as a leaders on greenhouse gas reductions and on creation of clean energy jobs.”

Patrick tried squaring those two parts of his past in his 2011 book “A Reason to Believe,” writing he “worked to make Texaco the first major oil company to stop arguing about the science of climate change and to join those in search of solutions.”

But should Patrick's campaign gain traction, it is easy to see his competitors treating his time at Texaco as a flaw rather than feature.

The 2020 Democratic race has been defined by ambitious plans like the Green New Deal, which calls for an eventual end to the oil and gas business altogether, as well as by calls from Warren, Sanders and others to prosecute fossil fuel executives for damaging the planet.

“Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused,” Sanders said in August. And just this week, Warren put forward a plan proposing to punish companies that knowingly mislead federal agencies, citing ExxonMobil as an example for privately researching climate change while publicly dismissing the science.

Rees, the campaigner with Oil Change U.S., expects activists to still ask Patrick to sign a “No Fossil Fuel Money” pledge committing candidates to turn down donations over $200 from oil, gas and coal executives, lobbyists, and associated political action committees. Most of the top Democratic contenders, including moderates like former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have signed by the pledge.

“We are going to press him just as hard, if not harder,” Rees said of Patrick.

POWER PLAYS

— A Green New Deal pitch on public housing: Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have introduced a bill to update the nation’s public housing units to be energy efficient. It’s the first specific legislation out of the Green New Deal framework Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) outlined months ago, The Post’s Renae Merle and David Weigel report. The so-called “Green New Deal for Public Housing Act” would “use seven grant programs to upgrade housing units into carbon-neutral communities with organic grocery stores, on-site child care and community gardens. Residents of public housing would be given preference in hiring to renovate those units.”

The details: “The bill would cost between $119 billion and $172 billion over the next decade and create up to 240,723 jobs a year, according to estimates developed by Data for Progress, a progressive think tank,” they write. They noted experts say there are about 1 million public housing units in the United States, many of which need billions of repairs.

“I think it’s very exemplary of what we try to do with the Green New Deal, where we have a front-line community that has historically gotten the short end of the stick with environmental justice,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Possible roadblocks: ""Ocasio-Cortez’s new legislation is far less expensive than an upgrade of all housing, or the other aspects of the Green New Deal that spooked Democrats. But it could meet resistance from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has signaled she will adopt 'pay-as-you-go' rules requiring that any new spending be paid for or offset.""

— Here we go again: President Trump said during a joint news conference in the Oval Office with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the purpose of keeping U.S. troops in Syria was to protect oil fields.

To quote: “We are keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil,” Trump said.

“We are keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil,” Trump said. The remarks appear to contradict what administration officials have said about the purpose of the U.S. military mission: “I would be cautious with saying that ‘the mission to secure the oil fields.’ The mission is the defeat of ISIS,” Navy Rear Admiral William D. Byrne Jr. said during a Defense Department media briefing last week. As the Energy 202 as noted before, there are likely too many legal, economic and strategic hurdles for it to make sense for any U.S. firm to extract the Syrian oil.

— Manchin expresses support for Trump’s pick to replace Perry: Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he plans to support the nomination of Dan Brouillette, who Trump formally named last week to replace outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

To quote: “I like Dan, I'm going to support Dan and vote for Dan,” the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee said during an event hosted by the Natural Resources Defense Council, according to E&E News. Manchin added that he found “Dan to be extremely bright and knowledgeable” and that he “had the knowledge, even though he might have come from the political arena.”

Manchin added that he found “Dan to be extremely bright and knowledgeable” and that he “had the knowledge, even though he might have come from the political arena.” This bodes well for Brouillette’s confirmation: “Manchin's comments would appear to take away any drama over Brouillette's impending confirmation hearing set for [Thursday] morning. The current deputy secretary already moved through the Senate in 2017 with bipartisan support,” E&E News reports. “And with Manchin saying his vote remains unchanged from that time, Brouillette could be in line for a quick confirmation process.”

— Greta Thunberg sets sail back to Europe: The 16-year-old Swedish climate activist is on her way back across the Atlantic. After the COP25 climate conference had to relocate to Madrid because of protests in Santiago, Chile, Thunberg — who says she won't fly because of the high carbon emissions from air travel — put out a request on Twitter for help finding an alternate mode of transport, and found help from an Australian couple with a catamaran. “La Vagabonde is outfitted with solar panels and hydro-generators, so it has a minimal carbon footprint,” NPR reports. “The voyage is expected to take two to four weeks, and Thunberg hopes to reach Spain in time for the climate conference taking place Dec. 2 to 13. The boat's location can be tracked online.”

— Children could be particularly harmed by climate change impacts: A study published in the medical journal the Lancet found that if the world fails to curb emissions and limit temperatures to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” by the end of the century, there would be “health problems caused by infectious diseases, worsening air pollution, rising temperatures and malnutrition,” the New York Times reports. And children would be especially susceptible to the consequences. “Part of the exposure risk that children face is simply that they spend more time outside than adults. Coupled with their differing physiology, it makes them more susceptible to fine particulate pollution,” per the report. “These same factors also mean they are more likely to suffer from the effects of extreme heat associated with climate change; eight of the 10 hottest years on record have happened this decade.”

The acting ambassador to Kyiv testified that he observed a shadowy campaign of off-the-books diplomacy conducted for President Trump by Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and Gordon Sondland, the megadonor-turned-E.U.-ambassador whose portfolio doesn’t include Ukraine.

“This irregular channel of diplomacy,” Castor said, “it is not as outlandish as it could be, is that correct?”

Taylor couldn’t contain a little chuckle. “It is not as outlandish as it could be,” he conceded. “I agree.”

Even the most unrealistic thriller can always be more outlandish. It was the funniest moment of a surprisingly somber day – and a reminder that the first televised impeachment hearing was not nearly as much of a circus as it could have been.

Yes, there were raised voices and a few testy exchanges between members. Those fireworks are getting replayed on cable this morning. But the hearing was as civil, and substantive, as one could realistically expect from a Congress that’s become so polarized in the modern era.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) forced another Republican member off the Intelligence Committee so that Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) could get a perch to poke holes in and cast doubt upon the testimony of witnesses who will appear over the next few weeks. Jordan, as the ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee, has proved himself as one of the president’s most dogged defenders. He’s a scrappy former wrestling coach who doesn’t wear a suit coat and always looks like he’s ready to pick a fight. But Jordan didn’t get time to question Taylor or Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent until nearly four hours into the six-hour hearing.

Democrats felt they accomplished what they set out to do, even if no cracks emerged in GOP support for Trump. It made for a striking juxtaposition to former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s circus-like appearance before the House Judiciary Committee two months ago. Five decisions made by Democratic leaders since that hearing on Sept. 17, which they widely conceded was a debacle, enabled this outcome:

1) Putting the Intelligence Committee in charge of the impeachment inquiry after the Lewandowski mess elevated Chairman Adam Schiff.

The California Democrat kept control of the hearing, just as he’s kept the inquiry on track. Schiff, a former prosecutor, has earned a reputation as both a more effective questioner than Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, who held the gavel during Lewandowski’s appearance, and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel. Both are New Yorkers.

Schiff, 59, exudes a more-in-sadness-than-in-anger demeanor than his counterparts, which makes it harder to paint the inquiry as overzealous. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Schiff supporter and fellow Californian, has tried to set what she calls a “prayerful” tone. “I do think that we need to have a common narrative,” she told her members yesterday morning before the hearing, according to someone in the room. “This is a very serious event in our country. We wish it could have been avoided. None of us came here to impeach a president.”

Republicans are eager to paint impeachment as highly partisan and portray Democrats as obsessed with impeachment since Trump won the 2016 election. They displayed a poster board behind the dais yesterday to convey this message: It was a partial quote from Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who said on television earlier this year that “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get reelected.”

2) Doing the closed-door depositions in advance meant that Democrats knew what to ask and didn’t waste time beating around the bush.

Remarkably, the hearing wrapped about half an hour earlier than television producers expected, something that’s rare in a chamber with so many loquacious members who seem to enjoy hearing themselves talk.

Some House Democrats were concerned going into the hearing that it would get covered by the print media as a nothing-burger if the witnesses simply repeated on camera what they had said during their closed-door depositions that have already been released. But Taylor made news by revealing a previously undisclosed July 26 phone call between Trump and Sondland, in which the president apparently asked about “the investigations” he had sought into political rivals. Taylor understood that they were following up on the matter a day after Trump spoke with Ukraine’s new leader, Volodymyr Zelensky. “Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward,” he said. Taylor added that, after the call, his aide asked Sondland what Trump thought of Ukraine, and Sondland responded that “President Trump cares more about the investigations of [Joe] Biden.”

3) Letting the witnesses deliver long opening statements on their own terms made the hearing look less partisan.

Compare Taylor’s testimony to former special counsel Bob Mueller’s appearance before the very same committee this summer. Ironically, it was the day before Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky. Mueller clearly didn’t want to be there. He didn’t want to play along with the Democratic desire to get him to read aloud parts of his report for the benefit of a television audience. His opening statement was relatively short. And he kept his answers short.

Schiff was happy to give Taylor and Kent the floor for as long as they wanted to speak, which is unusual during a high-profile hearing like this. This allowed them to make a nonpartisan case for the importance of Ukraine to the U.S. national interest.

“Ukraine is important for our national security and we should support it — not to provide that would be folly,” said Taylor, who was appointed ambassador to Ukraine by George W. Bush and returned earlier this year at the request of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “Even as we sit here today, the Russians are attacking Ukrainian soldiers in their own country. I saw this on the front line last week.”

Taylor’s voice reminded many viewers of Walter Cronkite’s.

4) Giving a lawyer for each side 45 minutes to question the witnesses meant less grandstanding and more substance.

Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman, a former prosecutor, covered a lot of ground and kept the conversation on track. The members on the committee, meanwhile, each got five minutes. Many devoted a significant chunk of that time to offering commentary in lieu of posing questions.

Schiff, a former prosecutor as well, also gave himself the ability to redirect. After Republicans on the committee cited Zelensky’s public statements that he did not feel pressured by Trump as evidence that Trump didn’t pressure him, for example, the chairman coaxed Kent and Taylor into explaining the reasons why Zelensky might feel compelled to say that even if it wasn’t true. Both witnesses noted that Zelensky would understand that Trump could impose serious consequences should he publicly challenge his account of their interactions. They also agreed that Zelensky, still new in the job, is sensitive to domestic perception and would not want to tell his own people that he had felt like he had to capitulate to American demands.

A former George W. Bush White House press secretary spoke for many Republican strategist types when he faulted the performance of the GOP counsel:

Whatever the GOP counsel is doing, it's not working. I don't undertand where he's going. — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) November 13, 2019

It will be interesting to see how the GOP members change up their strategy in the next few hearings. Marie Yovanovitch, the ex-ambassador who got recalled, is set to testify tomorrow for the second open session. The embassy staffer who Taylor said overheard Trump ask Sondland about the investigations, David Holmes, has agreed to a closed-door deposition on Friday. Sondland is slated to testify publicly next Wednesday. His lawyer said he’ll respond to Taylor’s testimony about the July 26 call with Trump at that time. The committees involved in the inquiry also announced that they expect Mark Sandy, who oversees national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, to testify behind closed doors on Saturday. That’s significant because no other OMB staff member has shown up yet to answer questions.

5) Not waiting for legal battles to play out allowed Democrats to emphasize the degree to which Trump is still stonewalling the investigation.

Schiff has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he’s not going to let the Trump administration go “rope-a-dope,” a boxing technique to describe moving around the ring to avoid clashing. He decided not to wait for depositions with key witnesses like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney or former national security adviser John Bolton. There are court cases playing out related to the enforcement of subpoenas that Trump officials have refused to comply with. Schiff felt waiting on these to play out would delay the start of the public phase too much. Wednesday showed he didn’t need to wait.

Democrats yesterday repeatedly highlighted notes and other records that have not been turned over, including from Taylor and Kent, by the State Department. This undercut the White House talking point that there aren’t first-hand witnesses. There aren’t first-hand witnesses because they’re not being allowed to appear.

-- But, but, but: This process has already become the latest case study of the tribalism that threatens to tear the republic apart. If Democrats hold revelatory hearings but Republicans dig in and persuadable independent-minded people don’t pay attention, does it matter?

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump ally on Capitol Hill who is reportedly angling to replace Mulvaney as White House chief of staff, defended the president on Wednesday by arguing that truth itself is subjective. “I think what happens is, when we start to look at the facts, everybody has their impression of what truth is,” Meadows told reporters at the Capitol.

Whatever you think of him and the prospect of impeachment, Trump has no doubt moved the bar for what kind of presidential behavior shocks the conscience.

-- “Like virtually everything else in Washington over the past three years, even without the president in the room, this was another episode of the Trump Show — the transformation of the U.S. government into a long-running drama about one outsize personality,” Marc Fisher observes. “Even as the hearing’s spotlight stayed fixed on Trump — his phone calls, his policy shifts, his quest to find usable dirt about a leading Democratic rival — the possible removal of the president seemed to lack the potency and gravity of previous impeachments. Committee members largely steered clear of the kind of dark oratory that launched impeachment debates in 1973 and 1998 … Trump’s remarkable ability to skate through crises that wreck other people’s lives — bankruptcies of his businesses, abandoned projects, divorces and accusations of sexual misbehavior — seemed again to be at work. …

“Public opinion hasn’t settled into any consensus about whether Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart was a big deal. When a CBS News poll asked Americans this month whether Trump’s dealings with Ukraine were typical of how presidents work with foreign countries, 42 percent said Trump’s acts were ‘the kind of thing most presidents probably do,’ while 58 percent said he acted in a way that ‘few or no other presidents have.’

“On Google, searches for ‘impeachment’ topped the trending charts for much of the day, but the volume didn’t come close to the previous day’s leader: a nationwide quest for information regarding Sonic the Hedgehog, the video game character that is getting its own adventure movie next year.”

COMMENTARY FROM THE POST’S OPINION PAGE:

HOW IT’S PLAYING ON THE RIGHT:

“If you thought Robert Mueller’s pathetic testimony … was bad, well, what we saw today was even more pathetic, more desperate and actually worse,” said Fox News host Sean Hannity. “Matter of fact, it was a total ‘Schiff’ show, if you know what I mean.” Hannity called Kent and Taylor “uncompelling” and “seemingly more important than they really are.”

Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle thought the hearing fell short, calling it a “Democrat dud.”

“In a healthier political culture, Democrats would be using the Ukraine episode as an argument against Mr. Trump’s re-election. How can you trust his foreign-policy judgment in a second term when he won’t have the check of another re-election?” writes the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board. “Instead Democrats have pulled out the constitutional bazooka of impeachment. … They are turning impeachment into a routine political weapon, and future Presidents of both parties will regret it.”

“Trump’s hotels and golf courses are big, as are his rallies and his rhetoric. Too often, though, his vision of the presidency is way too small,” writes the Washington Examiner’s editorial board. “The public impeachment hearings have highlighted this myopia.”

HOW IT’S PLAYING ON THE LEFT:

“Smears and attacks by America’s enemies brought against us by other Americans working with those corrupt forces, that’s a new level of wrong for our country,” said MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.

Republicans are living in an alternate reality, writes Mother Jones’ David Corn: “The committee’s GOP members spent much of the day trying to sidestep the core facts of the controversy and replace them with conspiracy hogwash to divert attention from the incriminating evidence.”

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “I’m horrified. I’m appalled. If you had told me three years ago it would come to this, I wouldn’t have believed this. I don’t think I could have imagined a president, any president, engaging in this sort of conduct,” said conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, in a rare appearance on MSNBC.

ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN:

-- Prosecutors closed their case against Roger Stone by portraying him as a serial liar who repeatedly made false statements to Congress to protect Trump, and then engaged in a campaign to silence a witness who could expose him. Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Ann E. Marimow report: ""'Roger Stone knew if this information got out, it would look really bad for his longtime associate Donald Trump,’ Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis told jurors set to begin deliberations Thursday over whether Stone lied to House investigators two years ago about an effort to find political dirt on Trump’s Democratic opponent. … Defense attorney Bruce Rogow told jurors that Stone had no reason to lie to protect Trump … Stone’s attorneys have argued that he did not intend to lie to the committee but saw much of what they asked for as outside the scope of a probe of Russian interference. Prosecutor Michael Marando called that claim ‘nonsense.’ Stone himself, he noted, repeatedly mentioned WikiLeaks and the exposed emails in his opening statement to Hill investigators. …

“Because of Stone’s lies, Kravis said, the committee never interviewed Stone’s intermediaries or saw his correspondence, and their ‘report is not accurate’ when it says there is no evidence that he got information from WikiLeaks. Stone did not take the stand or offer witnesses in his defense. But jurors listened in court to 50 minutes of the House testimony that sparked the case. Rogow urged them to listen to the entire three-hour hearing themselves. ‘This was not the voice of a man who was trying to lie, to mislead,’ he argued. His voice also came through in four days of government testimony featuring his profane boasts and apparent threats to Randy Credico, a talk-show host who could contradict Stone’s House testimony. Credico, Kravis said, was the ‘one guy out there who can knock down this whole house of cards,’ and Stone ‘knew that could never happen.’”

-- Congress can seek eight years of Trump’s tax records, a federal appeals court ordered, moving the conflict closer to the Supreme Court. Ann E. Marimow reports: “The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit let stand an earlier ruling against the president that affirmed Congress’s investigative authority on a day when the House was holding its first public impeachment inquiry hearing. Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said in response to Wednesday’s decision that the president’s legal team ‘will be seeking review at the Supreme Court.’ The D.C. Circuit was responding to Trump’s request to have a full panel of judges rehear a three-judge decision from October that rejected the president’s request to block lawmakers from subpoenaing his longtime accounting firm. A majority of the court’s 11 active judges voted against revisiting the case. Three judges — Neomi Rao, Gregory Katsas and Karen LeCraft Henderson — indicated that they would have granted the rehearing and published dissenting statements. Rao and Katsas, both former Trump administration officials, were nominated to the bench by the president.”

-- Chad Wolf was sworn in as the new acting secretary of homeland security. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration services, will become acting deputy. Nick Miroff reports: “Cuccinelli had been Trump’s preferred choice for the top job, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) dislikes Cuccinelli, and senior Republican senators have indicated that they will not confirm him for a permanent job. Wolf replaces Kevin McAleenan, who assumed the acting DHS chief role when Trump removed Kirstjen Nielsen in April. Mc­Aleenan received the president’s praise but was never nominated for the job, and he submitted his resignation Oct. 11. … How long Wolf and Cuccinelli will be in the acting roles is unclear. White House officials say Trump does not plan to nominate Wolf for the permanent position, and some of the immigration restrictionists who back the president have criticized Wolf’s prior lobbying work on behalf of foreign companies that sought employment visas.”

-- Trump’s political appointees inappropriately retaliated against a State Department career civil servant in part because of her ethnic background, her perceived political views and the fact that she worked in government during prior administrations, according to a new report from State Department Inspector General Steve Linick. From Politico: “Linick recommends that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo consider disciplining officials found to have violated policies that require they use merit-based factors in determining where to place career staffers. … The report focuses largely on events in 2017, under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and covers five distinct cases of individuals alleged to have been subject to unfair personnel decisions due to ‘politicized and other improper’ practices. … The report was fueled in large part by Democrats’ demands after a whistleblower shared with Congress emails in which Trump political appointees and outside conservative figures appeared to plot to sideline Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, a career civil servant of Iranian descent. Nowrouzzadeh, a U.S.-born staffer who joined government during the George W. Bush administration, was abruptly taken out of the Policy Planning division of the State Department in the wake of these conversations. One of the officials involved in curtailing her detail was Brian Hook, who led the Policy Planning division at the time and is now a top Iran aide to Pompeo.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump welcomed Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House with open arms, even though the Turkish president ignored his warning a month ago to not invade northeastern Syria. David Nakamura, Karen DeYoung and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump said a tentative cease-fire is holding in northeastern Syria and thanked Erdogan for ‘his cooperation.’ He said the two leaders ‘made tremendous progress’ toward more than quadrupling bilateral trade — to $100 billion — and ‘hopefully will be able to resolve’ a conflict over Turkey’s purchase of a sophisticated Russian missile defense system. … Erdogan shared Trump’s assessment of their talks as productive, but he also took the news conference as an opportunity to list outstanding grievances. Chief among them is the U.S. failure to extradite Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, a permanent U.S. resident, who Erdogan’s government claims masterminded a 2016 coup attempt. …

“Erdogan also criticized the House’s passage last month of a resolution officially designating the 1915 Turkish slaughter of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians as genocide, something Turkey had strenuously lobbied against for years. At one point during Wednesday’s talks, Trump invited a group of Republican senators critical of Turkey to join them. ‘We’re having a very good discussion,’ Trump told reporters as Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Ted Cruz (Tex.), James E. Risch (Idaho), Rick Scott (Fla.) and Joni Ernst (Iowa) sat on couches before him and Erdogan in the Oval Office. ‘The purpose of this meeting is to have an American civics lesson with our Turkish friends,’ said Graham, who last month called on Trump to ‘stand up to Erdogan’ and branded the Turkish leader as a ‘thug.’ … Several Democratic senators [called] Trump’s decision to host Erdogan … ‘absolutely shameful,’ and some Republicans voiced similar, if more muted, concerns. ‘This is an unfortunate time, in my opinion, for the visit,’ Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) … In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he ‘shared my colleagues’ uneasiness at seeing President Erdogan honored at the White House.’”

-- Outside the White House, demonstrators angry at Erdogan chanted “Turkey out of Syria” and “Turkey is a terrorist!” Marissa J. Lang and Peter Hermann report: “The gathering came amid heightened security to avoid a repeat of Erdogan’s last visit in 2017, when clashes broke out between his security guards and a group protesting him outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence at Sheridan Circle.”

-- The U.S.-China trade talks have hit another snag, this time over farm purchases. From the Journal: “Mr. Trump has said that China has agreed to buy up to $50 billion of soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from the U.S. annually. But China is leery of putting a numerical commitment in the text of an agreement, according to people familiar with the matter. Beijing wants to avoid cutting a deal that looks more favorable to the U.S. than to China, some of the people said, and also wants to have flexibility within the agreement should trade tensions escalate again. ‘We can always stop the purchases if things get worse again,’ said one Chinese official.”

-- The deadliest form of the pneumonic plague infected at least two people in China. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “Local health officials confirmed the two cases of pneumonic plague on Tuesday, according to Xinhua News, China’s state-run news agency. The two patients, who authorities say received ‘proper treatment,’ hail from China’s Inner Mongolia region. Additional information on the patients and their health status was not available Wednesday, and it’s not clear when the cases were identified. Officials told Xinhua that ‘relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.’ … The pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease, according to the World Health Organization, and the only type that can spread from person to person through the inhalation of respiratory droplets. It is sometimes caused by untreated cases of the more common bubonic plague, and symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and rapidly developing pneumonia.”

-- An even scarier story about superbugs: Drug-resistant germs sicken about 3 million people every year in the United States and kill about 35,000, representing a much larger public health threat than previously understood, according to a long-awaited report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lena H. Sun reports: “The new estimates show that, on average, someone in the United States gets an antibiotic-resistant infection every 11 seconds, and every 15 minutes, someone dies. Bacteria, fungi and other germs that have developed a resistance to antibiotics and other drugs pose one of the gravest public health challenges and a baffling problem for modern medicine. Scientists, doctors and public health officials have warned of this threat for decades, and the new report reveals the top dangers and troubling trends. More pathogens are developing new ways of fending off drugs designed to kill them, and infections are spreading more widely outside of hospitals. No new classes of antibiotics have been introduced in more than three decades.”

-- A new report in the Lancet, a medical journal, warns that climate change -- if unchecked -- will badly compromise the health of children around the globe. From the Times: “The report compared human health consequences under two scenarios: one in which the world meets the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement and reins in emissions so that increases in global temperatures remain ‘well below 2 degrees Celsius’ by the end of the century, and one in which it does not. The report, published Wednesday, found that failing to limit emissions would lead to health problems caused by infectious diseases, worsening air pollution, rising temperatures and malnutrition. … Children are especially vulnerable partly because of their physiology. … As a result, children absorb more air pollution given their body size than an adult would in the same situation.”

-- A separate Oxford Economics report reveals that climate change may devastate the global economy even sooner and harder than feared. From Bloomberg News: “In the absence of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the earth could warm by 2 degrees Celsius by 2050, cutting global gross domestic product by 2.5% to 7.5%, Oxford estimates, with the worst affected countries being in Africa and Asia. Longer term, a rise in temperatures of 4 degrees by 2100 could cut output by as much as 30%.”

-- The rapidly warming waters in the Sea of Okhotsk, wedged between Siberia and Japan, have led to the collapse of northern Japan’s salmon population, which coincides with another alarming development: the loss of a unique blanket of sea ice that dips far below the Arctic. Simon Denyer and Chris Mooney are on the ground: “The area has warmed in some places by as much as 3 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, making it one of the fastest-warming spots in the world ... The rising temperatures are starting to shut down the single most dynamic sea ice factory on Earth. The intensity of ice generation in the northwestern Sea of Okhotsk exceeds that of any single place in the Arctic Ocean or Antarctica, and the sea ice reaches a lower latitude than anywhere else on the planet. Its decline has a cascade of consequences well beyond Japan as climate dominoes begin to fall. When sea ice forms here, it expels huge amounts of salt into the frigid water below the surface, creating some of the densest ocean water on Earth. That water then sinks and travels east, carrying oxygen, iron and other key nutrients out into the northern Pacific Ocean, where marine life depends on it. As the ice retreats, that nutrient-rich current is weakening, endangering the biological health of the vast northern Pacific — one of the most startling, and least discussed, effects of climate change so far observed.”

-- Europe’s lax speed limits once appeared irrevocable, but climate change is changing that, as well. Rick Noack reports: “After a year of major global climate protests and groundbreaking court rulings, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Wednesday grudgingly announced that his government would lower maximum daytime speed limits on many highways from about 81 mph to 62 mph. The change is part of a broader — and potentially only temporary — set of measures that are supposed to curb emissions. But they could signal a growing momentum for similar proposals across Europe that would align European maximum speed limits more with their, on average, lower U.S. equivalents.”

-- Venice isn’t the only corner of Europe experiencing serious flooding. Parts of northern England are also knee-deep in some of the worst flooding that’s hit the island in years. Miriam Berger reports: “Amid the downpour, Britain’s embattled (remember Brexit?) prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been ruefully absent in the views of many affected residents. Opposition leaders have criticized him for not declaring the situation a state of emergency, which would have accelerated help to flooding areas. On Wednesday, people had the chance to tell him off — and they did so in very stern British style. As Johnson toured flood-affected areas, residents heckled and chastised him for not coming sooner. ‘It took you over five days,’ one woman scolded Johnson, as he sat, head bowed, nursing a cup of tea. ‘You should have been there Saturday morning, having a meeting, making sure that these people get the help and support. And I’m sorry, but your announcement yesterday was a pittance.’”

-- Bolivia’s deposed president Evo Morales rejected the self-proclaimed presidency of opposition senator Jeanine Añez, but police barred his lawmakers from entering the legislature to undo it. Rachelle Krygier reports: “Añez, the second vice president of the Bolivian Senate and a Morales critic, attempted to convene the upper house Tuesday to name an interim president and discuss a path toward new elections. Other opposition leaders urged support for Añez. But [members of Morales’s MAS party], who still hold majorities in the legislature, boycotted the session. In the absence of a quorum, Añez declared herself president of the Senate, which effectively made her interim president of the country. … Bolivia’s constitutional tribunal quickly released a statement saying it was constitutional, the heads of the military and national police declared their support, and a senior U.S. State Department official recognized Añez as ‘Interim Constitutional President.’ … Añez began work Wednesday at the presidential palace, meeting with military and police commanders. She insisted that her mandate was ‘strictly temporary’ and that her only objective was to call elections as soon as possible. Under the Bolivian constitution, new elections must be held within 90 days of Morales’s resignation.”

-- Añez’s surprise move to seize the Bolivian presidency prompted a closer look at racist remarks she’s made towards the country's indigenous majority. From the Guardian: “One tweet from 2013 – later deleted – describes indigenous Aymara new year’s celebrations as ‘satanic’ and concludes: ‘Nobody can replace God!’ In another post, she questioned whether a group of indigenous people were genuine because they were wearing shoes.” Also, in a clear sign that she intends to steer Bolivia away from Morales’s socialism, one of Añez’s first acts was to recognize the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela, overturning Bolivia’s support for Nicolás Maduro.

-- A group of Guaidó supporters seized the Venezuelan Embassy in Brazil, claiming its employees defected and voluntarily let them inside. Marina Lopes reports: “But Freddy Meregote, the embassy chargé d’affaires representing the government of ... Maduro, said that the staff remains loyal to Maduro and that Guaidó supporters forced their way in. … The confrontation occurred as the leaders of Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa arrived in Brasilia for a summit to discuss the instability in Venezuela, among other issues. Brazilian police surrounded the embassy but did not enter. The standoff ended shortly after 5 p.m., as a group of at least 14 Guaidó supporters left the embassy under escort by police and members of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. They had occupied the facility for more than 12 hours.”

-- Denmark will end its 60 years of hassle-free travel at its border with Sweden, establishing new border checks in the wake of bombings by Swedish gangs. From the Times: “The measures put in place on Tuesday are temporary and will be applied intermittently, but the Danish police said that most travelers should carry passports or national identification cards. Only air travelers from Sweden will be exempted. ... Sweden has had border checks on travelers from Denmark since 2016. But the Danish passport checks come as its neighbor has been rocked by more than 100 explosions in the first 10 months of this year. Officials have blamed the blasts — up from 39 at the same time last year — on criminal gangs. The explosions have spread to Denmark, where at least 13 have occurred in Copenhagen this year, although the police have not linked them all to Sweden.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, joined the Democratic presidential race today. Matt Viser reports: Patrick “jumped into the Democratic presidential contest, asserting that he wanted to build ‘a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American Dream’ and acknowledging the difficulty his late start creates in achieving that goal. ‘I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field; they bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,’ he said in a video released Thursday. … After registering for the ballot in New Hampshire later Thursday, Patrick plans to head to California, a state that falls early in the primary calendar and has a wealth of delegates. … Patrick has political strengths and an ability to deliver such soaring oratory that President Barack Obama was accused of taking lines from a 2006 speech of his. He became a two-term governor using an uplifting life story and an aspirational political brand, traits that his allies say could serve him well in a presidential campaign. … It was unclear whether Patrick had spoken with [Elizabeth] Warren, the U.S. senator from his home state and someone whose political rise he helped in 2012 when he defended her against questions about her claims of Native American heritage.”

-- Meanwhile, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is still deciding whether to run for president, but he will definitely not appear on the primary ballot in New Hampshire. From CBS News: “Bloomberg does not plan to file to be on the ballot for the Democratic contest as in the first-in-the-nation primary in the Granite State, an aide [says]. ... There is no word yet on whether the former mayor plans to file to appear on the ballot in the other early contest states. Iowa, which holds the first caucus, doesn't have a ballot filing deadline because it uses the caucus system.”

-- Elizabeth Warren bought time on CNBC to run a commercial blasting billionaires. From the Times: “In a new TV ad, Ms. Warren singles out a series of billionaires who have spoken out against her, showing footage of them and repeating her call for a wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans. The ad, set to air Thursday on CNBC in New York City and Washington, is the latest volley in the back-and-forth between Ms. Warren and the country’s billionaires — or at least an outspoken handful of them who have criticized her publicly. … ‘It is time for a wealth tax in America,’ Ms. Warren says in the ad, which shows her speaking at a recent town hall event. ‘I’ve heard that there are some billionaires who don’t support this plan.’”

-- Former housing secretary Julián Castro will miss the November debate. From Politico: “Ten candidates are projected to participate in the debate cohosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post on Nov. 20 in Atlanta, according to Politico’s tracking of public polling and donor figures: [Biden], Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, [Warren] and Andrew Yang. … Castro is not the only active candidate who missed out on the debate stage. Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, John Delaney and Marianne Williamson all participated in earlier debates but will not qualify for the November debate. Joe Sestak and Wayne Messam have never qualified for a debate and will not be on stage next week, either.”

-- After his heart attack, Bernie Sanders has adopted a more wholesome regimen, taking long walks and eating salads. From the Times: Jane ""Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. ‘I’ve noticed him ordering a heck of a lot more salads,’ said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager. Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. In the six weeks since he suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders has been working hard to move past his health issues, adhering to a newly wholesome regimen that has included more exercise and a healthier diet.”

-- Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are introducing a Green New Deal bill for public housing. Renae Merle and David Weigel report: The legislation will “give the country’s public housing units an energy-efficiency overhaul, their first attempt at turning the Green New Deal’s broad framework into specific policy. The bill … would use seven grant programs to upgrade housing units into carbon-neutral communities with organic grocery stores, on-site child care and community gardens. Residents of public housing would be given preference in hiring to renovate those units. ... The bill would cost between $119 billion and $172 billion over the next decade, according to estimates developed by Data for Progress, a progressive think tank. It would create up to 240,723 jobs a year, the group estimated. … Ocasio-Cortez’s new legislation is far less expensive than an upgrade of all housing, or the other aspects of the Green New Deal that spooked Democrats. But it could meet resistance from [Pelosi], who has signaled she will adopt ‘pay-as-you-go’ rules requiring that any new spending be paid for or offset. Progressive Democrats have objected to that requirement and said deficit spending is sometimes necessary.”

-- Echoing Washington, the student body president of the University of Florida faces impeachment after bringing Donald Trump Jr. to campus for $50,000. Meagan Flynn reports: “The student body president, Michael Murphy, was served with the impeachment resolution and accused of malfeasance and abuse of power … For Trump, the key piece of evidence is his July phone call with the Ukrainian president — but for Murphy, it’s an email, a short exchange with a Trump campaign consultant that his critics say is proof of misconduct. The group of senators seeking Murphy’s impeachment argue that the Oct. 10 speaking engagement for Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle, his girlfriend, was funded with mandatory student fees in violation of rules banning the use of public students funds to support or oppose a ‘political party at any level.’ In the eyes of critics, Murphy’s correspondence with the Trump fundraising consultant ahead of the event bolsters their case that Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle’s appearance was a campaign event.”

“Imagine somebody goes to a hotel to rent a room and the clerk says, ‘We’re not renting a room to you because we don’t have rooms available and we don’t rent rooms to black people,’"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of University of California’s Berkeley School of Law, who will argue on Allen’s behalf. “Under Comcast’s theory, that wouldn’t be enough to prove discrimination.”

AD

This could be the most important civil rights case before the Supreme Court this term, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Discovery and trial processes are crucial in understanding whether racial discrimination motivated an action, Clarke said, and requiring victims to meet that burden of proof when they first plead their case would be a “death knell” for the civil rights statute.

“A negative ruling by the court will literally cut out the heart of this most important law by requiring victims of discrimination to demonstrate that race and nothing more influenced the contested action,” Clarke said. “We would essentially shut the courthouse door on most people seeking to invoke protections of this law.”

AD

Comcast said its argument is consistent with previous interpretations of the statute and rejects the notion that its stance would set back civil rights protections.

AD

“We have been forced to appeal this decision to defend against a meritless $20 billion claim,” Sena Fitzmaurice, a spokeswoman for Comcast, said in a statement emailed to The Post. “Our argument at the Supreme Court is narrowly focused. We are not seeking to roll back any civil rights laws.”

Fitzmaurice said the case “cannot detract from Comcast’s strong civil rights and diversity record” and pointed to other black-owned channels carried by Comcast with programming aimed at African American audiences, including Revolt, the music network launched by Sean Combs, and Aspire, owned by Magic Johnson Enterprises.

AD

Allen’s case has garnered support from dozens of civil rights organizations, legal experts and lawmakers, as well as presidential candidates Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The Lawyers’ Committee, headed by Clarke, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund have both filed briefs in support of Allen but did not take a position on the merits of his claims.

AD

“In pursuing this case to the Supreme Court … Comcast is putting corporate profits ahead of public interest, and is employing a scorched earth policy to defend a corporate business decision,” Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) said in a letter to Comcast’s chief executive, Brian Roberts, adding he believes Comcast “needs to be broken up.”

Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was designed to safeguard equal opportunities for Americans to work, bank, shop, rent or buy a home, and become entrepreneurs without racial discrimination, civil rights groups said in the briefs. It protects a broad swath of people, including independent contractors in the gig economy and consumers racially profiled by retailers, in scenarios not covered by other major civil rights statutes, they said. And unlike the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the older statute has no cap on damages.

Allen, 58, sued Comcast in February 2015 for refusing to feature ESN’s lifestyle channels, including Comedy.TV, Recipe.TV, MyDestination.TV, Cars.TV and Pets.TV, though they appeared on Verizon, DirecTV, AT&T and DISH programming. For eight years, Comcast gave the network “the runaround with false promises of carriage,” Allen’s lawyers argued. Comcast said it lacked “sufficient bandwidth” for the ESN channels but launched several “lesser-known, white-owned” channels in the same period.

AD

By way of explanation, Allen’s lawyers allege in their brief, one Comcast executive told ESN, “We’re not trying to create any more Bob Johnsons,” referring to the media magnate and co-founder of Black Entertainment Television.

“I’ve never said they don’t do business with black people,” Allen told The Post. “This has always been about a lack of true economic inclusion.”

AD

A district court dismissed Allen’s suit multiple times before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed that decision in November 2018.

The Justice Department and U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed briefs in support of Comcast, arguing the appeals court erred in deciding that a plaintiff could win by showing that race was just one factor in a decision not to enter into a contract.

“In so doing, the court arrived at a rule that does not apply to any other federal anti-discrimination law: A defendant is subject to damages liability under Section 1981 solely because the plaintiff can prove that an illegitimate motive played a part in the defendant’s conduct, even if the defendant would have taken the challenged action without regard to any protected characteristic,” wrote Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco.

Michael Foreman, a law professor and director of the Civil Rights Appellate Clinic at Pennsylvania State University, called the Trump administration’s support of Comcast “a significant departure” in how the U.S. government has previously addressed race discrimination.

“Given how divided our country is, and that we still have issues of race discrimination … I struggle with whether our justices are willing to say that some level of race discrimination is permissible, which is what they would be saying,” Foreman said.

Back in June, against the usual carping about Iowa and about caucuses, I wrote my quadrennial defense of the Iowa caucuses as an imperfect element of an imperfect nominating system. Usually by this point in the cycle, the complaints have subsided before reaching a crescendo on Caucus Night (February 3) if the results displease people with microphones and bullhorns. But hating on Iowa is sharply evident this week thanks to the vocal unhappiness of candidates who aren’t doing so well there and their considerable resentment of a candidate who is: Pete Buttigieg.

The New York Times amplified the latest round of kvetching:

Former vice-president Joseph R. Biden Jr. said this week — to an Iowa reporter no less — that the caucuses were not “representative …”

And Julián Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said Iowa was “not reflective of the United States” and “not reflective of the Democratic Party.” He called for the state to lose its spot at the front of the presidential nominating calendar.

Even the candidate vying with Buttigieg for the lead in Iowa is feeling some heat, though she hasn’t let it drive her into saying something stupid:

Senator Elizabeth Warren demurred when she was asked at a forum in South Carolina whether the order of the early-nominating states should change because Iowa and New Hampshire were “two of the whitest states in the country.” “Are you actually going to ask me to sit here and criticize Iowa and New Hampshire?,” she said. “I’m just a player in the game.”

The question asked of Warren is clearly related to the hypothesis that Mayor Pete — who was actually in the lead in Iowa, according to a new Monmouth poll of the state — is getting an undue advantage from the order of states because of his weakness among the minority voters who begin weighing in after Iowa and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, candidates who rely heavily on minority voters (basically, the minority candidates plus Biden) are struggling as the bitter winter weather of Iowa and New Hampshire approaches. Ron Brownstein suggests the field may essentially be bleached by the honky hordes of the first two states:

[W]hile all Democratic campaigns expect nonwhite voters, especially African-Americans, to play a central role in picking the nominee, they could be choosing only among white candidates. That will happen if poor performances in preponderantly white Iowa and New Hampshire effectively winnow out the race’s leading candidates of color: African-American Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, Latino former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro, and Asian-American entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Blaming the weakness of minority candidates on the pale complexion of the Iowa and New Hampshire electorates, however, doesn’t explain their poor performance in polling in more diverse states. Castro has never polled better than 2 percent in Nevada. And in Monmouth’s October poll in South Carolina, where a clear majority of Democratic primary voters will be African-American, black candidates Harris and Booker were at a booming 6 percent and 2 percent, respectively.

In any event, as Nate Silver argues, you can get a better sense of where the race stands by looking at the four early states — those whose early order is protected by national party rules — as a unit:

Taken collectively, polls in the four early states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina — tell almost the same story as national polls: Biden leads, Elizabeth Warren is in second, Bernie Sanders is in third, and Buttigieg is still a fairly distant fourth.

Trouble is, Iowa results have typically affected candidates’ standing in New Hampshire, and both have affected subsequent contests. That’s exactly why candidates like Booker and Harris, whose most important state is South Carolina, have gone all in on Iowa, hoping to duplicate Barack Obama’s two-cushion shot in 2008.

Obama’s solid win over Hillary Clinton and John Edwards that year should have dampened the idea that Iowa Democratic caucus-goers only have eyes for white candidates. For that matter, Iowa leaders supported the expansion of the protected early-state tent between the 2004 and 2008 elections to include the more diverse Nevada and South Carolina and would likely be amenable to other accommodations in the future as long as they didn’t threaten the state’s first-in-the-nation status.

A shift away from caucusing is more problematic for Iowans, since it would trigger New Hampshire’s state law requiring it to hold the very first primary. That conundrum is a reminder to those demanding a more “rational” nominating system that there really is no national system at all but instead a calendar of state-party-run caucuses and state-government-run primaries, with the national party influencing the order and the rules of participation by sticks and carrots but not running the show. A big push from the DNC did help reduce the number of caucuses from 10 in 2016 to just three (Iowa, Nevada, and Wyoming) this year, and Iowa Democrats have labored to provide alternative caucusing arrangements that are more convenient to people who work on Caucus Night or have mobility issues. (Unfortunately, a plan to allow caucusing by phone fell prey to hacking fears, and we’ll have to see how well the backup plan for “satellite caucuses” works out).

In the end, presidential candidates fearing the wrath of Iowa and New Hampshire leaders (and voters) and those states’ willingness to adapt and cut deals to keep their position have maintained the traditional calendar. It will take more than halftime complaints about the rules and the refs to change it all. And in the meantime, if Iowa and New Hampshire give Buttigieg more of a lift than he deserves, there will be plenty of opportunities later in the year to bring him right down to earth."

Among the many factors that contributed to Hillary Clinton’s shocking defeat in 2016, one pretty much everyone agrees upon (though not necessarily about its relative significance) is a falloff in African-American turnout relative to 2012. The numbers are clear, as Politico reported in 2017:

The Census’ Current Population Survey, released Wednesday, shows 65 percent of white citizens cast ballots in last year’s presidential election, up from 64 percent four years earlier.

But the turnout rate among African-American citizens tumbled sharply, the survey shows. Only 59 percent of black citizens voted in 2016, down from 66 percent in 2012 and 65 percent in 2008.

Those national numbers may underestimate the size and impact of lower black turnout in individual battleground states, as Osita Nwanevu observed:

Crucially, the drop in black turnout was even sharper in states where the margin of victory was less than 10 points than it was nationally — in those battleground states, black turnout dropped 5.3 points. In two critical states that swung to Trump — Michigan and Wisconsin — black turnout dropped by just more than 12 points. Declines were less dramatic but significant in other swing states Trump carried: Ohio (down 7.5 points), Florida (4.2), and Pennsylvania (2.1). White turnout declined modestly in each of those swing states but Florida and Pennsylvania, where it increased by 3.5 points and 5.2 points respectively. Clinton lost each of those swing states but Ohio by a margin of less than 2 points.

Conversely, a return to higher black turnout could be a key element in toppling Trump next year. In a major study from the Center for American Progress, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin project that natural demographic trends in the last four years plus a return to 2012 levels of African-American voting would flip four states — Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — and give Democrats a 294-244 majority in the Electoral College. And even if black voting turnout doesn’t quite hit those levels, in many states even marginal changes in turnout and Democratic vote-share could make the difference in a close race.

Will black turnout rebound to 2012 automatically after nearly three years of the most openly racist president since Woodrow Wilson? That’s unclear. In the 2018 midterms African-American turnout rose 10.8 percent as compared to the last midterm in 2014, as compared to an 11.7 boost in white turnout. And there’s also some evidence (though it’s at best mixed) that Trump is marginally more popular with black voters now than he was in 2016, though he remains overwhelmingly unpopular.

The most obvious factor to which to attribute the 2012-2016 falloff in African-American turnout is the absence at the top of the ticket of the first African-American president. 2016 black turnout, in fact, returned to its pre-Obama, 2004 levels. What’s hard to calculate is whether the 2008-2012 turnout boom was a unique event attributable to Obama’s pioneering status (much like the sky-high margins John F. Kennedy won among Catholics in 1960 or Jimmy Carter’s big wins in the Deep South in 1976), or could be replicated by another African-American at the top of the ticket in 2020 or beyond.

There is some suggestive evidence that black candidates still matter with black voters. The Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman noted that in the 2019 off-year elections in Mississippi, the white (and culturally conservative) Democratic gubernatorial nominee didn’t generate very robust African-American turnout as compared to the moderate black Senate candidate who ran in a 2018 special election:

[T]urnout in Mississippi was down from last November’s special Senate election, when GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith defeated Democrat Mike Espy 54 percent to 46 percent. The reason? Hood, a conservative white Democrat who had long served as the state’s attorney general, failed to mobilize Mississippi’s black voters to the same extent as Espy, who is African American and had represented the Mississippi Delta in Congress in the 1990s.

In Mississippi counties where white residents outnumber African Americans, 2019 turnout was down just 3 percent versus last fall and Hood took 39 percent, up from Espy’s 37 percent. But in Mississippi counties where African American residents outnumber whites, 2019 turnout was down 8 percent and Hood took just 68 percent, down from Espy’s 69 percent. In Jackson’s Hinds County, the largest in the state, turnout was down 11 percent.

On the other hand, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that in the 2020 Democratic presidential nominating contest, two African-American senators whose résumés compare favorably to Obama’s when he first ran are really struggling with black voters. In a recent Monmouth poll of South Carolina, where roughly 60 percent of the primary electorate is African-American (and where Obama romped to a landslide win over Hillary Clinton in 2008), the top-polling black candidate, Kamala Harris, is losing the black vote to Joe Biden by a 39-8 margin. In fact, Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are all beating Harris among black voters. And Cory Booker is mired in the low single digits in South Carolina. Both Harris and Booker have been forced to go all-in on the Iowa Caucuses in an effort to impress black voters later in the schedule that they are viable. And they aren’t doing well there, either. A third on-paper-viable black candidate, Deval Patrick, joined the contest, but this corporate-oriented former governor of a very white state has a lot to prove to black and white voters alike.

Biden’s strong position among black voters at present is a living refutation of another theory: that Democrats can energize African-Americans with an aggressively progressive agenda aimed at addressing economic inequality and institutional racism. Black Democrats are more likely to self-identify as “moderate” than are white Democrats. And ideology aside, a self-conscious pitch to black voters may not work for a candidate who for whatever reason doesn’t resonate with the target: Pete Buttigieg has an impressive agenda for black empowerment he calls the “Douglass Plan.” His African-American following remains very small.

So what are Democrats to do?

It might help if they less conspicuously obsess about other potentially conflicting constituencies like white working-class voters and normally Republican white suburbanites. Traditional base mobilization strategies that have been effective among black voters in the past should get attention and plenty of money.

But perhaps the single best way for Democrats (or if they were willing to do so, Republicans) to boost black turnout is to fight like hell for their right and their opportunity to vote. With voter-suppression efforts ongoing in Republican-governed states all over the country, it’s a target-rich environment for Democratic pols and party leaders to show some serious solidarity with the voters they want to turn out on their own behalf.

If, God forbid, I was in charge of a currently successful Democratic presidential campaign supporting a white candidate, I would whisper into the ear of my boss the idea that she or he should not only consider but perhaps announce early a ticket that includes Georgia 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams. She is African-American and a moderate on most issues, and above all, has devoted herself to voting rights and knows everything there is to know about mobilizing minority voters. If there’s a way to reach Obama-like levels of black turnout in 2020, there’s no one more likely to figure out how to do it, and then to do it."

AD

This question is particularly acute for Patrick because, although he has long been thought of as a potentially strong presidential candidate, on economic issues his profile is not exactly built to warm the hearts of the Democratic base.

AD

Patrick has spent his career moving between government and corporate positions, including some that are likely to raise uncomfortable questions among Democratic primary voters. After running the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton, he joined the board of Ameriquest, one of the worst offenders among the subprime mortgage lenders who helped create the Great Recession. Patrick also worked as general counsel for Coca-Cola and Texaco — yes, he was an oil company executive.

And after leaving the governor’s mansion in 2015, Patrick went to Bain Capital, the private equity firm co-founded by Mitt Romney. You may remember that in 2012, Democrats absolutely savaged Romney over Bain’s business model, which often involves buying companies, stripping them for parts and then selling off what’s left at a profit. The attack was so brutally effective that “Saturday Night Live” mocked it with a skit.

AD

It just so happens that among Elizabeth Warren’s economic proposals is one directly targeting private equity. It would impose a new set of requirements on firms like Bain, making it somewhat more difficult for them to still make large profits when the companies they buy go belly up. I can’t say what effect her bill would have on the economy as a whole, but it tells a stark morality tale, about vulture capitalists who line their pockets while ruining the lives of middle-class Americans. It would certainly be interesting to hear her and Patrick debate this.

AD

This highlights both the policy and rhetorical difference between candidates like Warren and Bernie Sanders on one side, and candidates like Patrick, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg on the other. All say they want to address inequality and promote the interests of the middle class. On Patrick’s website, his still-vague “Vision” section talks about “growing the economy out to working people and the marginalized, not just up to the well connected.” They all say they want to build an economy that works for everyone.

But when Warren and Sanders talk about inequality, they tell a story with villains. Inequality didn’t just happen, it’s the result of certain people getting their way, people whose power must be curbed and whose wealth must be aggressively taxed. Warren has a new ad going after billionaires, one you can’t imagine someone such as Patrick or even Joe Biden airing.

AD

That’s true even if they have some policy proposals the capitalist class will find unappealing. Biden, for instance, not only wants to raise the minimum wage but would strengthen unions and bar non-compete clauses that strip workers of power. But he also says, “I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble,” adding that ""I get into a lot of trouble with my party when I say that wealthy Americans are just as patriotic as poor folks.""

AD

A pessimist (or a cynic) might say that ambitious proposals like a wealth tax will never get through Congress anyway, which means that in the end a President Warren will probably end up where a President Biden would begin, with some relatively modest tax increases on the wealthy used to fund more benefits and services aimed at lower- and middle-class people. That’s an entirely plausible scenario.

But it’s also true that as a political matter, the arguments made by the more moderate candidates either devolve into something anodyne or come off sounding, if not insincere, then at least unconvincing. When Patrick says, as he did on Thursday, “We’ve had a system where we have crowded and hoarded all of the benefits of our prosperity in a very, very few. This is what trickle-down economics looks like,” it’s hard not to respond, “I’m glad you feel that way, but don’t you work for Mitt Romney’s private equity firm? Doesn’t that make you the problem?”

AD

The most passionate candidate isn’t always the one who wins, of course. It’s entirely possible that what the public is looking for is a nice fellow whose heart is basically in the right place and who can calm things down a bit. But at this point it’s hard to see Deval Patrick’s message — whatever it turns out to be — transforming the race.

Deval Patrick at the Bridge Cafe in Manchester, N.H., on Thursday. (Charles Krupa/AP)

CONCORD, N.H. — In his first minutes as a candidate for president, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick set his ground rules. He would not be “trying to climb up by pulling anybody else down.” He would make “contrasts,” giving voters the information they needed to distinguish him from 16 other Democratic candidates.

Those contrasts did not have to be nice. Joe Biden seemed to be saying “that if we just get rid of the incumbent, we can go back to doing what we used to do,” Patrick said. Elizabeth Warren, who he was “incredibly fond” of, was running a great campaign that absolutely would not prepare her for the presidency.

“I think the actual business of advancing an agenda, once elected, is a different kind of undertaking,” Patrick told dozens of reporters crowded into the New Hampshire secretary of state's office.

Patrick, whose initial decision to not run for president did not stop allies from urging him on, spent Thursday reintroducing himself as a pragmatist who could stitch together his party and the country. In doing so he divided Democrats even further. The most crowded primary in American history now has, depending on who you ask, two or three credible left-wing contenders, four or five credible center-left candidates, and either one, two or three “front-runners.”

Allies of Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) believe that Patrick could pull voters from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), former vice president Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — anyone at the top but Sanders. Some centrists think that Patrick could offer a pull-the-alarm option if Biden falters, and some worry that he can only further split their vote and widen the opening for Warren or Sanders.

On Wednesday morning, Democrats on the left were worrying that a Warren-Sanders split would leave their movement without a nominee; by Thursday morning, the party's centrist wing seemed to be in disarray.

“If Biden were as strong as Hillary Clinton was in 2016, I would be concerned,” said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Sanders campaign. “But we're going to have the moderate vote split with Biden and Buttigieg and Booker and now Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg. I mean, look at the lines — they're a lot longer on their side than they are on the progressive side.”

There is nothing new about Democratic panic, but there is something different about the mood now, three months before the Iowa caucuses, than in previous cycles. In 2007 and 2015, the primary was simple: Everyone else was in a struggle to become the alternative to Hillary Clinton. A clear establishment-versus-outsider story line had been carved out. Labor unions and party leaders were well into picking their candidates. By this point in 2015, most of the largest labor unions had endorsed Clinton: the National Education Association, the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

None of those unions has made an endorsement yet, and leaders of all three have altered the process so that official candidate backing will come much later. It has become easier for candidates such as Patrick and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has not yet officially entered the race, to pitch themselves as potential saviors to centrists, even as uncertainty ripples through the left. Tomorrow, Sanders will officially accept the endorsement of National Nurses United, three months later than its endorsement of his last campaign. Back then, the union had only one suitor; this year it got pitches from Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg.

“Last time there was just one candidate who backs our issues, so this was more difficult,” said Jean Ross, NNU’s co-president, who said it was largely positive for multiple left-wing candidates to seek the nomination. “I don’t think that can hurt so long as the principle is that health care is a human right. The others, you’ve seen them evolving toward something less, and something less will not work.”

Online, the debate between supporters of Sanders and Warren can grow bitter, something that has begun to worry groups that would be relatively happy with either as a nominee. But there is not much urgency on the left about making a choice before voting begins. The Center for Popular Democracy Action, which has held an endorsement process for a coalition of left-wing community groups, announced this week that Warren, Sanders and Julián Castro had all advanced to the next stage, with an endorsement possible, but not certain, next month.

“The purpose of this endorsement is to make sure a neoliberal does not win the nomination,” explained CPDA co-president Jennifer Epps-Addison. “We are thrilled and excited. Many of us have been waiting our whole lives to have just one progressive be considered a top contender, much less three.”

The tumult among the party's centrists — a hard term to define, but one donors are comfortable with — has bought the left some time. Patrick's maiden voyage to New Hampshire found the candidate making exactly the pitch made by Biden, Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in early states, with the implicit argument that none of those candidates was running strong enough campaigns. At the state house, and during a visit to a cafe in Manchester, Patrick took questions about specific policies as cues to talk broadly about bringing the country together.

“I'm going to try to be a candidate with an ambitious agenda, but also some humility, because I think [no] one candidate, no one party has a corner and all the best ideas,” Patrick said in Concord. “As you draw on those ideas to sharpen and refine your own agenda, then I think we have not just a better chance of enacting that agenda, but having that agenda last.”

Over two long Q&As with reporters, Patrick previewed a campaign that could unleash more business-friendly money into the primary, something that could complicate the strategies of Biden et. al. while painting a bright target for the left. While Biden refused for years to endorse a super PAC on his behalf, Patrick said he would consider one right away.

“It'd be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” Patrick said. “I don't know what that is. I don't know where that will come from. And I wish it weren't so. I wish the campaigns weren't as expensive.”

That would leave Patrick and Biden as the only Democrats with super PACs, right before the expected start of a Bloomberg candidacy that would unleash tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising on behalf of another centrist. The idea for centrists is that Bloomberg or Patrick could offer an insurance policy in later-voting states if Biden fades; the read from more left-wing Democrats is that more easy targets are entering the race.

“It’s a really good thing for progressives that there are two transformative candidates speaking for the values of our movement,” said Joe Dinkin, a spokesman for the left-wing Working Families Party, which was pilloried by some on the left for endorsing Warren. “And it’s clear that the corporate-friendly candidates are in disarray.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

San Francisco District Attorney candidate Chesa Boudin speaks on Nov. 5. (Scott Strazzante/San Francisco Chronicle/AP)

The final elections of 2019 will happen Saturday, in Louisiana, where conservative Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards is seeking a second term and where Republicans could secure a legislative supermajority. Victories for the GOP would end a mixed but largely positive year for Republicans in red states — a win in North Carolina’s soon-to-be-redrawn 9th Congressional District, a near-sweep of Kentucky’s statewide offices, and none of the upsets that cost the party seats in 2017 or 2018.

Down the ballot, especially in big cities, 2019 has also been a banner year for the left. The scope of its wins became clear in only the past few days, as California and Washington counted more ballots. Chesa Boudin, a public defender whose parents went to prison for their role in an armed heist, came out ahead in the race for San Francisco district attorney — the biggest and most resonant win for criminal justice reformers since the 2017 election of Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner. In Seattle, left-wing candidates routed business-friendly challengers backed by Amazon. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

From state to state, left-wing organizing in sometimes sleepy local elections paid off. Republicans made more gains in rural areas, like southwest Pennsylvania, but continued to lose power in suburbs or cities; the exceptions, like Jacksonville, Fla., sometimes came where Democrats simply failed to compete. But where they organized, via everything from the Working Families Party to Democratic Socialists of America to Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio's “canary candidates” program, more left-wing candidates prevailed. A rundown:

Chicago: In April, socialist-backed candidates won a string of city council elections: Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Jeanette Taylor, Michael Rodriguez, Byron Sigcho-Lopez, Matt Martin, Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez, Andre Vasquez and Maria Hadden. The latter three unseated Democratic incumbents; all of them would go on to side with the city's teachers union in a fight with new Mayor Lori Lightfoot.

Denver: Candi CdeBaca, a self-described anarchist backed by the WFP, won a seat on the city council, joining disability rights activist Chris Hinds and formerly homeless activist Jamie Torres; in the city's school board elections, the left elected Tay Anderson and Brad Laurvick, backed by teachers unions. As Melanie Asmar wrote, the wins “could mean a departure from long-standing reform policies opposed by the union, including approving new independent charter schools and closing low-performing schools.”



Milwaukee: As in Denver, teacher-backed candidates swept races for the school board, even ousting the only incumbent who sought reelection.

Morgantown, W.Va.: The local branch of the Working Families Party elected seven city councilors in the college town that has become the bluest part of a very red state; one candidate, Zack Cruze, unseated an incumbent with a write-in campaign.

New York: Jumaane Williams prevailed in February's all-party race for public advocate; he won November's election, for the final two years in the job, by 56 points. Williams took over the job from now-Attorney General Letitia “Tish” James, two wins in a row for the left-wing WFP.



Phoenix: Carlos Garcia, an activist with the Puente Human Rights Movement (and campaigner against former Maricopa County Sherrif Joe Arpaio) won a seat on the city council.



Philadelphia: Left-wing incumbent city councilors such as Helen Gym won reelection; the Working Families Party, which took advantage of a law that requires two at-large council seats to be reserved for minor parties, ousted a Republican with city councilor-elect Kendra Brooks.

Seattle: Amazon's seven-figure intervention in city elections backfired dramatically, with even the incumbent city councilor who seemed most vulnerable — socialist Kshama Sawant — prevailing after late-arriving ballots were counted. Pro-labor, left-wing candidates now have a council supermajority and are considering whether to completely ban PAC donations by corporations that have foreign investors. If implemented, that would prevent another 2019-style intervention by Amazon.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Elizabeth Warren, “Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires.” Warren's campaign has run fewer ads than any close rival's — just one short cable buy in Iowa. Here, it's taking a page from Tom Steyer's “Need to Impeach” and running a spot only on a specific cable channel, to get a rise out of very specific viewers. (Steyer would hit Fox News; Warren is hitting CNBC.) The 60-second spot starts with Warren introducing her wealth tax then plays the complaints of four billionaires: Leon Cooperman, Joe Ricketts, Lloyd Blankfein and Peter Thiel.

John Delaney, “Real Solutions.” The first candidate to enter the race (28 months ago) will run his longest commercial — a 30-minute spot on Iowa TV markets, telling his business-to-politics biography and explaining why he entered the race. In it, he denounces “extreme partisanship,” pegging it as one of the main reasons he had to run: “How can 50 percent of the people be wrong 100 percent of the time?”

Pete Buttigieg, “Refreshing.” The Indiana mayor has continued to sharpen his criticism of Medicare-for-all legislation in TV spots. Criticism of the (unnamed) Democrats who want to replace private insurance with a single-payer plan is outsourced to Iowa voters. “We have to have people have the choice to keep their private health insurance or to go on the Medicare plan,” says one. “He seems sensible, not going to promise something that he cannot deliver,” says another.

Andrew Yang, “Paycheck.” One of Yang's first spots in New Hampshire returns to the original theme of his campaign, something emphasized a bit less in his other ads: the universal basic income of $1,000 per month.

POLL WATCH

2020 election in Pennsylvania (Muhlenberg, 410 registered voters)

Joe Biden — 53%

Donald Trump — 44%

Bernie Sanders — 50%

Donald Trump — 45%

Elizabeth Warren — 50%

Donald Trump — 45%

The latest Democratic panic was sparked by a New York Times-Siena poll that found every leading Democrat in a dead heat with the president in the three decisive 2016 states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Pennsylvania-based Muhlenberg poll finds each Democrat more clearly ahead of the president in the commonwealth, and at 50 percent. (Why that matters: Muhlenberg's final 2016 poll found a 44-to-40 lead for Clinton. She wound up with 47.5 percent of the vote, as a surge of undecideds for Trump and a scatter of third-party votes gave him a win with 48.2 percent.) Every Democrat is viewed more unfavorably than favorably, but not as much as Trump, or as Clinton, who was 25 points underwater in the final 2016 poll. Every Democrat loses white voters and by similar margins: Biden gets 46 percent of them, to 44 percent for Warren and Sanders. But Clinton won only 40 percent of those voters in 2016. With an electorate that resembled that year's, the president would be behind any challenger.

IN THE STATES

California. Cenk Uygur, the founder of the Young Turks liberal video network, appeared in paperwork for a candidacy in the state's 25th Congressional District — the one vacated this month by Democrat Katie Hill. Uygur declined to comment on the filing but promised an announcement on Thursday's prime-time show. Until now, Democrats in the swing seat, which has been trending blue, were consolidating around Assemblywoman Christy Smith.

Kentucky. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin conceded his race for a second term Thursday, nine days after losing to Democratic Attorney General Beshear. “We’re going to have a change in the governorship based on the vote of the people,” Bevin said at a news conference, as a recanvass, which he had asked for, was not finding any change in Beshear's 5,000 vote margin. “I’m not going to contest these numbers that have come in. It isn’t fair to throw that on our legislature.”

New York. Democrats got their first major recruit in the 2nd Congressional District, which is being vacated by Republican Rep. Peter King: city councilwoman and veteran Jackie Gordon. She got an endorsement from Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, as 2018 nominee Liuba Gretchen Shirley, who lost a sleeper race by six points, continues to consider the race.

Utah. Jon Huntsman, who left the governor's office to become ambassador to China, then left that office to run for president, is reportedly leaving his post as ambassador to Russia to seek the Republican nomination for governor again.

DEBATE SEASON

The qualifying period for the November Democratic debates has closed, and 10 candidates made it: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer. Only one candidate who qualified for last month's debate, and remains in the race, missed the cut: Julián Castro.

That wasn't a surprise, as polling had found Castro far below the 3 percent threshold. His hopes of hitting 4 percent in early states, another way to qualify, was also dashed: The race's only Latino candidate polled at 1 percent in the Nevada Independent's survey, the only one in that state before Wednesday's cutoff. Still, as of Thursday morning, a Facebook ad was still urging supporters to donate to Castro and help him make the stage.

“Quickly — NBC News just warned I could be cut from the next debates,” the ad read. “I need a massive surge of support to fund the ads I’ll need to spread my message and make the cut. Will you rush $15?”

Castro had already hit the 165,000 donation mark, the other metric for making the debates, which was irrelevant without the poll numbers. His campaign said that the Nov. 20 debate, co-sponsored by MSNBC and The Washington Post, would not determine whether the candidate still mattered.

“Whether it's immigration, police violence, housing, or other issues, Secretary Castro is shaping the debate, regardless of whether he's onstage,” said Castro spokesman Sawyer Hackett. “While the ground shifts under the front-runners, and billionaires buy their spot on stage, Secretary Castro is fighting for the most vulnerable communities, and telling truths other candidates are unwilling to speak.”

2020

The impeachment hearings have brought a temporary pause to the Medicare-for-all debate, which has sometimes consumed the Democratic primary. Supporters of the policy are raring to defend it, though; Data for Progress, which partners with YouGov Blue to ask about candidate and policy strength, recently tested three different descriptions of how the policy could be financed.

Asked whether they might support a ""tax on employers that requires them to pay for health care for every employee"" as Elizabeth Warren laid out this month, 47.6 percent of voters supported it, while 36.2 percent were opposed. Asked about a ""per-employee fee by employers to the Medicare system,"" 50.1 percent of voters were in favor, to 31.6 percent opposed. The least-popular option was a progressive tax starting on income above $29,000; 31.5 percent of voters supported it, to 51.7 percent opposed.

Joe Biden. He won the support of Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who ended his own presidential campaign last month. Ryan, 46, had run a shoestring campaign that pitched him as a living embodiment of the Rust Belt working class; in an interview with MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” Ryan said that Biden could win voters such as those -- ""blue-collar workers that we have to have if we’re going to beat Donald Trump."" Two months earlier, Ryan had told a Bloomberg News reporter that Biden was ""declining"" and might be a weak candidate in the fall; he never retracted those remarks, but never otherwise criticized Biden.

Cory Booker. He was endorsed by New Hampshire state Rep. Gerri Cannon, the first transgender member of the legislature, who was elected last year.

Andrew Yang. He introduced a series of tech reforms, including a “Department of the Attention Economy” which would regulate how distracting devices affect children, and a “Digital Bill of Rights” to help users retain control of their data.

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a Green New Deal for Public Housing, the first specific legislation to grow out of the nonbinding Green New Deal resolution, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, which would spend more than $170 billion to retrofit low-income housing. Meanwhile, an analysis by the left-wing magazine In These Times found that MSNBC, nominally the most liberal of the cable networks, had been more negative on Sanders than many other candidates.

Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign stepped up its billionaire-trolling effort with a new “Billionaire Tears” mug, commemorating a CNBC interview in which Leon Cooperman got weepy talking about her criticism of the extremely wealthy. “Savor a warm, slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union-made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do,” the campaign wrote.

Environmental activists have repeatedly asked Democrats running for president to reject donations from fossil-fuel executives. So how will they — and the rest of the Democratic base — react to a former oil executive jumping into the race?

That’s the question raised by Deval Patrick’s sudden 2020 candidacy. The former Massachusetts governor made it official this morning by releasing a YouTube video (see below), saying his nascent presidential bid is about “the character of the country.”

But Patrick may soon be faced with questions about his time in the oil business as Democratic voters, especially young ones, express heightened concern about climate change. His long career in the private sector before becoming the state’s first black governor includes a stint at a top executive at Texaco, once one of the nation’s biggest oil companies.

That and other résumé lines could come back to haunt Patrick as he enters a Democratic race increasingly defined by what ranges from deep skepticism to outright hostility of big corporations and the oil and natural gas sector in particular for its contributions to climate change. Patrick is currently managing director at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm co-founded by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

“We don’t think he has any chance,” said Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at Oil Change U.S., one of several green groups pressing 2020 candidates to forgo donations from fossil-fuel executives. “It’s pretty laughable.”

Weighing against that private-sector job is Patrick’s long record as governor in which the state accelerated its adoption of renewable energy and joined the nation’s first cap-and-trade program for cutting carbon dioxide emissions.

The two-term governor, who has close ties to former president Barack Obama and his network of advisers, emphasized in his announcement his days growing up poor on South Side of Chicago rather than his time in the corporate boardroom.

But Patrick’s decision to abruptly join the crowded Democratic field, along with former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s plans to likely do the same, is yet another sign of anxiety among business-minded Democrats as Massachusetts’s own Elizabeth Warren, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), call for taxing the ultrarich.

Patrick began working with Texaco in 1997 to lead a task force meant to address its racially biased employment practices. The task force was formed as part of a $176.1 million settlement with the Harrison, N.Y.-based firm’s black employees, in what was at the time the largest racial discrimination lawsuit in U.S. history.

By the next year, Patrick was named the general counsel and vice president of the oil giant. As the company’s top lawyer, he helped shepherd a deal valued at $45 billion in 2001 merging Texaco with Chevron to form the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded oil company.

Unwilling to move to the San Francisco headquarters of the new company (called ChevronTexaco until 2005 when the name became Chevron), Patrick left for a job at Coca-Cola in 2001.

By the time he became governor six years later, Patrick was pursuing energy and environmental policies sometimes at odds with the interests of the oil and gas industry of which he was once part.

Patrick spearheaded the passage of laws and regulations encouraging homeowners and businesses to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and dramatically expanding solar energy, at times weathering criticism such policies were driving up energy costs. And under the Patrick administration, Massachusetts became one of nine states to join a market-capping carbon emissions from power plants, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

The result: Massachusetts is consistently ranked as the nation's most energy-efficient state in an analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. And despite its tiny landmass and long winters, Massachusetts has the eighth-highest total solar capacity in the country.

“It went from being a state that wasn't even on the map in terms of solar to being No. 8,” said Ian Bowles, who served as Patrick's secretary of energy and environmental affairs from 2007 to 2011. He added that the Patrick administration's policies “really positioned Massachusetts as a leaders on greenhouse gas reductions and on creation of clean energy jobs.”

Patrick tried squaring those two parts of his past in his 2011 book “A Reason to Believe,” writing he “worked to make Texaco the first major oil company to stop arguing about the science of climate change and to join those in search of solutions.”

But should Patrick's campaign gain traction, it is easy to see his competitors treating his time at Texaco as a flaw rather than feature.

The 2020 Democratic race has been defined by ambitious plans like the Green New Deal, which calls for an eventual end to the oil and gas business altogether, as well as by calls from Warren, Sanders and others to prosecute fossil fuel executives for damaging the planet.

“Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused,” Sanders said in August. And just this week, Warren put forward a plan proposing to punish companies that knowingly mislead federal agencies, citing ExxonMobil as an example for privately researching climate change while publicly dismissing the science.

Rees, the campaigner with Oil Change U.S., expects activists to still ask Patrick to sign a “No Fossil Fuel Money” pledge committing candidates to turn down donations over $200 from oil, gas and coal executives, lobbyists, and associated political action committees. Most of the top Democratic contenders, including moderates like former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have signed by the pledge.

“We are going to press him just as hard, if not harder,” Rees said of Patrick.

POWER PLAYS

— A Green New Deal pitch on public housing: Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have introduced a bill to update the nation’s public housing units to be energy efficient. It’s the first specific legislation out of the Green New Deal framework Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) outlined months ago, The Post’s Renae Merle and David Weigel report. The so-called “Green New Deal for Public Housing Act” would “use seven grant programs to upgrade housing units into carbon-neutral communities with organic grocery stores, on-site child care and community gardens. Residents of public housing would be given preference in hiring to renovate those units.”

The details: “The bill would cost between $119 billion and $172 billion over the next decade and create up to 240,723 jobs a year, according to estimates developed by Data for Progress, a progressive think tank,” they write. They noted experts say there are about 1 million public housing units in the United States, many of which need billions of repairs.

To quote: “I think it’s very exemplary of what we try to do with the Green New Deal, where we have a front-line community that has historically gotten the short end of the stick with environmental justice,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview.

“I think it’s very exemplary of what we try to do with the Green New Deal, where we have a front-line community that has historically gotten the short end of the stick with environmental justice,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Possible roadblocks: ""Ocasio-Cortez’s new legislation is far less expensive than an upgrade of all housing, or the other aspects of the Green New Deal that spooked Democrats. But it could meet resistance from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has signaled she will adopt 'pay-as-you-go' rules requiring that any new spending be paid for or offset.""

Whereby US and Turkey Presidents sit down in White House, defend their military presence in Syria and then claim its oil.

— Here we go again: President Trump said during a joint news conference in the Oval Office with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the purpose of keeping U.S. troops in Syria was to protect oil fields.

To quote: “We are keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil,” Trump said.

“We are keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil,” Trump said. The remarks appear to contradict what administration officials have said about the purpose of the U.S. military mission: “I would be cautious with saying that ‘the mission to secure the oil fields.’ The mission is the defeat of ISIS,” Navy Rear Admiral William D. Byrne Jr. said during a Defense Department media briefing last week. As the Energy 202 as noted before, there are likely too many legal, economic and strategic hurdles for it to make sense for any U.S. firm to extract the Syrian oil.

— Manchin expresses support for Trump’s pick to replace Perry: Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he plans to support the nomination of Dan Brouillette, who Trump formally named last week to replace outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

To quote: “I like Dan, I'm going to support Dan and vote for Dan,” the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee said during an event hosted by the Natural Resources Defense Council, according to E&E News. Manchin added that he found “Dan to be extremely bright and knowledgeable” and that he “had the knowledge, even though he might have come from the political arena.”

Manchin added that he found “Dan to be extremely bright and knowledgeable” and that he “had the knowledge, even though he might have come from the political arena.” This bodes well for Brouillette’s confirmation: “Manchin's comments would appear to take away any drama over Brouillette's impending confirmation hearing set for [Thursday] morning. The current deputy secretary already moved through the Senate in 2017 with bipartisan support,” E&E News reports. “And with Manchin saying his vote remains unchanged from that time, Brouillette could be in line for a quick confirmation process.”

After the COP25 climate conference had to relocate to Madrid because of protests in Santiago, Chile, Thunberg — who says she won't fly because of the high carbon emissions from air travel — put out a request on Twitter for help finding an alternate mode of transport, and found help from an Australian couple with a catamaran. “La Vagabonde is outfitted with solar panels and hydro-generators, so it has a minimal carbon footprint,” NPR reports. “The voyage is expected to take two to four weeks, and Thunberg hopes to reach Spain in time for the climate conference taking place Dec. 2 to 13. The boat's location can be tracked online.”

— Children could be particularly harmed by climate change impacts: A study published in the medical journal the Lancet found that if the world fails to curb emissions and limit temperatures to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” by the end of the century, there would be “health problems caused by infectious diseases, worsening air pollution, rising temperatures and malnutrition,” the New York Times reports. And children would be especially susceptible to the consequences. “Part of the exposure risk that children face is simply that they spend more time outside than adults. Coupled with their differing physiology, it makes them more susceptible to fine particulate pollution,” per the report. “These same factors also mean they are more likely to suffer from the effects of extreme heat associated with climate change; eight of the 10 hottest years on record have happened this decade.”

The Policies

BLAME GAME: President Trump has so far failed to follow through on his vow to secure tougher gun laws in the wake of this summer's mass shootings that killed dozens. The latest rationale from Republicans: The House's impeachment inquiry makes it impossible.

“Unfortunately, our discussions on the legislative aspects of this have been sidetracked because of the impeachment process on the Hill, and so we are going forward with all the operational steps that we can take that do not require legislative action,” Attorney General William P. Barr said at Wednesday event in Memphis, according to CNN's David Shortell. “Right now it does not appear that things in Washington are amenable to those kinds of negotiations and compromises.”

and so we are going forward with all the operational steps that we can take that do not require legislative action,” Attorney General William P. Barr said at Wednesday event in Memphis, according to CNN's David Shortell. What Barr did not mention: Trump, who called for imposing “meaningful” background checks this summer and finding ways to prevent those with mental illnesses from obtaining firearms, never offered a specific proposal. And the White House distanced itself from supporting aggressive legislation after blowback from conservative members -- all before the start of the impeachment investigation.

Stark imagery: A school shooter opened fire in Santa Clarita, Calif., leaving two students dead yesterday -- right as a Republican senator blocked an effort from Democrats to expand background checks.

News of the wrenching scene broke as Connecticut Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy made an emotional appeal to their colleagues on the Senate floor to pass universal background checks — making it at least the seventh shooting to occur on school grounds since the start of this academic year, according to our colleagues Mia Nakaji Monnier, Crystal Duan, Moriah Balingit and Katie Mettler.

“We can't go 24 hours without news of another mass shooting somewhere in America. My kids and millions others hide in corners of their classroom or in their bathrooms preparing for a mass shooting at their school, and this body does nothing about it,” said Murphy.

said Murphy. The gun background check bill was blocked by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), who objected to the unanimous consent request and argued that the bill should not be “exempt from consideration by the appropriate committee of jurisdiction,” per CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi.

Waiting on the White House: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also blamed the impeachment inquiry for the lack of legislative progress. “Impeachment has sucked all the oxygen out. But I hope we will revisit. I really do. I am ready to do something yesterday,”

But …: He added that Senate Republicans were “waiting on the White House” for guidance, according to ABC's Mary Bruce.

according to ABC's Mary Bruce. Graham told reporters that “there is bipartisan support for one part of a gun control package — a grant program that encourages states to set up 'red flag' programs that allow law enforcement officers to preemptively seize a person’s firearms if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others,” report BuzzFeed's Paul McLeod and Kadia Goba.

Republicans will likely be waiting a while …: Trump “has abandoned the idea of releasing proposals to combat gun violence that his White House debated for months following mass shootings in August,” White House officials and lawmakers told our colleague Josh Dawsey earlier this month. It's a “reversal from the summer when the president insisted he would offer policies to curb firearm deaths.”

The impeachment factor: “Trump has been counseled by political advisers, including campaign manager Brad Parscale and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, that gun legislation could splinter his political coalition, which he needs to stick together for his reelection bid, particularly amid an impeachment battle,” according to Josh.

” Dan Eberhart, a major GOP donor who told Josh that Trump is better off ignoring proposals for the time being. “I suspect that was the plan all along.” Trump was also “pressed repeatedly by NRA President Wayne LaPierre this summer and early fall to not propose any gun-control measures,” per Josh.

… And Democrats might, too: “I wish this weren’t the case, but Republicans’ interest in working on guns is driven by casualties of 15 or more. It’s so awful that it works like this,” Murphy said. “I don’t doubt that we’ll be back in a conversation about background checks, but it probably won’t happen until there’s another epic-scale shooting.”

By the numbers: Since the Columbine High massacre in 1999, more than 233,000 children at 243 schools across the United States have been exposed to gun violence during school hours, per The Washington Post's database of school shootings.

The NRA spent $54,398,558 to influence federal elections in 2016



In 2018, that number dropped to $9,551,320



How much will the influential group spend in 2020?

Barr's plan: Barr introduced a proposal on Wednesday “that would better enforce the U.S. gun background check system, coordinate state and federal gun cases and ensure prosecutors quickly update databases to show when a defendant can’t possess a firearm because of mental health issues,” per the Associated Press's Adrian Sainz and Michael Balsamo.

Known as Project Guardian, Barr unveiled it at his Memphis event the same day public impeachment hearings began in Washington.

The details: “As part of the program, U.S. prosecutors will coordinate with state and local law enforcement officials to consider potential federal charges when a suspect is arrested for weapons possession, is believed to have used a gun to commit a violent crime or drug-trafficking offense or is suspected of being a violent gang member,” Sainz and Balsamo report.

By contrast: The House in February to amend federal gun laws to require background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers — and extend the amount of time for the government to complete a background check on someone trying to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, from three days to 10 days.

Barr got blowback after news of Trump's efforts to explore expanding background checks leaked: “A leaked document outlining one Trump administration proposal to expand background checks on firearms sales prompted an uproar from the right [in September] — underscoring the significant challenges the White House will face on any additional gun restrictions it tries to advance in Congress,” our colleagues Seung Min Kim, Paul Kane, and Josh reported at the time.

ON THE TRAIL: Democratic 2020 candidates sought to keep pressure on Republicans throughout the day. Sen. Kamala Harris called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to reconvene the Senate to vote on the background check bill that already passed the House.

“We’ve all been together saying Mitch McConnell needs to convene the Senate,” Harris said on MSNBC. “We have a good bill that recognizes that we don’t need to take everyone’s gun, but we need to have smart gun safety laws … there’s been a failure of the United States Congress to have the courage to act. It is pathetic. It is pathetic, that people yield to a gun lobby on an issue that affects all our children.”

Former U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch departs after testifying in a closed-door deposition on Oct. 11. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)

On The Hill

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING: We'll be watching former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who not only saw firsthand Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associates' private efforts to influence U.S. foreign policy to Ukraine but experienced it. Despite praise from fellow diplomats and even some White House officials, Yovanovitch was ousted amid a smear campaign to undermine her, our colleagues Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger report.

Who is Yovanovitch?: A 33-year career diplomat, Yovanovitch has served under presidents of both parties. She was born in Canada in to parents who fled the Soviet Union, has worked as a diplomat in seven countries and previously served as ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia.

What she'll say: Her public testimony this morning “is expected to showcase how what appears to have begun as the personal crusade of private individuals became intertwined with efforts to use Ukraine to benefit Trump politically,” our colleagues write. Democrats also expect Yovanovitch to provide a visceral retelling of what is was like to watch her own president later attack her in a call with another foreign leader.

A moment of reckoning on gender: “The symbolism of that conflict underscores the significance of the historic probe, which was initiated by the female speaker of the House — Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — and made possible by female voters who helped deliver the House to Democrats in the last election,” our colleague Elise Viebeck reports.

How does she connect to the July 25 phone call?: Yovanovitch was ousted in April months before Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but many of same figures who pushed for Trump to remove her are central characters in the impeachment inquiry, including Giuliani and his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have since been charged with campaign finance crimes.

So why did they want her gone then?: Yovanovitch's efforts to push Ukraine to fight corruption appear to have angered a number of powerful Ukrainian politicians. But as our colleagues write, Guiliani displeasure mounted when the State Department refused to grant a visa to former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.

Joe Biden, as vice president, “had pushed for the firing of Shokin, who U.S. and European officials believed was not sufficiently aggressive in pursuing corruption cases,” our colleagues write. Shokin has claimed he was pushed aside because of an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company whose board members included former vice president Joe Biden's son. (We should note our colleagues and scores of fact-checkers have found no credence to the claims that Biden's efforts were designed to curtail an investigation nor evidence of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.)

The Investigations

WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW ON IMPEACHMENT:

There's now another source who overheard Gordon Sondland's call with Trump: As we detailed here, the stakes are high for ambassador to the European Union as evidence emerged of a previously unknown call with Trump about getting Ukraine to pursue investigations. Now there's another State Department official saying they overheard the call, our colleagues John Wagner, Felicia Sonmez and Colby Itkowitz report.

a Foreign Service officer based at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, “overheard the phone call and also witnessed Sondland’s other interactions during his trip to Ukraine, where the call took place in a restaurant … Jayanti was the embassy official tasked with accompanying Sondland throughout the day of the call.” Meanwhile, lawmakers will hear from the aide who told acting ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. about the Sondland call: David Holmes will testify behind closed doors this afternoon. One thing is certain: it will be challenging for Republicans to paint Holmes as a partisan as he was honored in 2014 with a State Department award for challenging President Obama's Afghanistan policy, our colleague Anne Gearan reports.

A White House official is set to break the blockade: Mark Sandy, a longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget, “is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday,” our colleague Erica Werner writes. If Sandy shows up for his closed-door deposition, he would be the first OMB official to cooperate with the inquiry.

Remember: OMB was the office that handled the hold on aid. Sandy could potentially fill in some key details on how that process unfolded.

The investigation into Rudy is wider than we thought: Giuliani “is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials,” Bloomberg's Chris Strohm and Jordan Fabian report. Other possible charges could relate to “bribing foreign officials or conspiracy.”

It's all about bribery now: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the Trump of “bribery” by seeking to use U.S. military aid as leverage to pressure the Ukrainian government to conduct investigations that could politically benefit the president, our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Toluse Olorunnipa report.

Why the change in wording: Pelosi's move away from the Latin quid pro quo came after House Democrats' campaign arm found the word “bribery” resonates more in battleground states, our colleague Rachael Bade wrote on Twitter. Bribery is also one of the specific phrases cited in the Constitution as an impeachable offense.

The GOP hones their attack: The lack of firsthand knowledge has become one of Republican's key rebuttals against the Democrats' case thus far, our colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report.

The Campaign

THE NOVEMBER DEBATE IS SET:

Here are the 10 Democratic presidential candidates that will be onstage next week: Biden, Harris, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg​​​​​​, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), financier and philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and businessman Andrew Yang.

There will be two fewer candidates than in October: Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro failed to make the stage for the first time. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke ended his campaign last month. There will be no new additions this time around.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro failed to make the stage for the first time. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke ended his campaign last month. There will be no new additions this time around. Tune in! The Nov. 20 debate, co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be held in Atlanta.

Meanwhile, Deval Patrick finds out just how hard it will be to break through: “He has no campaign cash, little campaign staff, low probability of qualifying for debates — and just 81 days to go, as of Thursday, before voting begins,” our colleagues Matt Viser and David Weigel report of the former Massachusetts governor's last-minute entry.

Timing is everything: “Patrick wants to appeal to black voters, but by a matter of days missed the deadline to make the ballots in Alabama and Arkansas, two states with large black populations,' our colleagues write. “He wants to win moderates and build a national coalition, but because he didn’t alert officials in Michigan of his candidacy earlier this week, he now faces the extraordinary task of gathering 11,000 signatures in the next month.”

Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters testifies to the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973. Millions of Americans tuned in to hearings that Variety called the “hottest daytime soap opera” in the country. (Associated Press/AP)

In the Media

'NOT EXACTLY HIGH DRAMA': “If you would like to watch grass grow, you would have loved the opening.” “Five hours of mostly colorless and snail's pace testimony.” What are we describing here?

If you were about fire off an angry tweet at yet another reporter for pointing out the lack of pizazz in current impeachment inquiry --- think again. Because 46 years ago, Washington Post reporter Jules Whitcover wrote those two descriptions and more about the first day of the Senate Watergate Commitee hearings.

The full Post front page:

In just a couple of months, things became much less boring: Jules didn't know then what we all know happened now. The world wouldn't learn until July 1973 that there was a taping system inside the White House.

Just over two months before Jules wrote that, lead White House counsel John Dean would call the Watergate case a ""cancer on the presidency"" during a conversation with President Nixon in the Oval Office as Dean talks about the foiled robbers potentially pejuring themselves. And in June 1972, when Nixon and White House chief of staff H.R. ""Bob” Haldeman plotted a cover-up less than a week after the break-in occured in what would become known as ""the smoking gun tape.""

He wasn't the only one who intitally wrote off the hearings: The networks ABC, CBS and NBC aired the hearings live each day but struck a deal to rotate coverage so they could still air their precious soap operas, as our colleague Gillian Brockell wrote earlier this week. But soon enough, the hearings became as popular, if not more, than their usual daytime dramas.

Key stat: ""By the time the 319 hours of Senate Watergate hearings had aired, nearly 85 percent of American households had watched at least some of them ...,"" our colleague writes.

This time could be very different though: As we saw unfold earlier this week, there are very clear echo chambers in how the allegations against Trump are being covered."

The acting ambassador to Kyiv testified that he observed a shadowy campaign of off-the-books diplomacy conducted for President Trump by Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and Gordon Sondland, the megadonor-turned-E.U.-ambassador whose portfolio doesn’t include Ukraine.

“This irregular channel of diplomacy,” Castor said, “it is not as outlandish as it could be, is that correct?”

Taylor couldn’t contain a little chuckle. “It is not as outlandish as it could be,” he conceded. “I agree.”

Even the most unrealistic thriller can always be more outlandish. It was the funniest moment of a surprisingly somber day – and a reminder that the first televised impeachment hearing was not nearly as much of a circus as it could have been.

Yes, there were raised voices and a few testy exchanges between members. Those fireworks are getting replayed on cable this morning. But the hearing was as civil, and substantive, as one could realistically expect from a Congress that’s become so polarized in the modern era.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) forced another Republican member off the Intelligence Committee so that Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) could get a perch to poke holes in and cast doubt upon the testimony of witnesses who will appear over the next few weeks. Jordan, as the ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee, has proved himself as one of the president’s most dogged defenders. He’s a scrappy former wrestling coach who doesn’t wear a suit coat and always looks like he’s ready to pick a fight. But Jordan didn’t get time to question Taylor or Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent until nearly four hours into the six-hour hearing.

Democrats felt they accomplished what they set out to do, even if no cracks emerged in GOP support for Trump. It made for a striking juxtaposition to former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s circus-like appearance before the House Judiciary Committee two months ago. Five decisions made by Democratic leaders since that hearing on Sept. 17, which they widely conceded was a debacle, enabled this outcome:

1) Putting the Intelligence Committee in charge of the impeachment inquiry after the Lewandowski mess elevated Chairman Adam Schiff.

The California Democrat kept control of the hearing, just as he’s kept the inquiry on track. Schiff, a former prosecutor, has earned a reputation as both a more effective questioner than Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, who held the gavel during Lewandowski’s appearance, and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel. Both are New Yorkers.

Schiff, 59, exudes a more-in-sadness-than-in-anger demeanor than his counterparts, which makes it harder to paint the inquiry as overzealous. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Schiff supporter and fellow Californian, has tried to set what she calls a “prayerful” tone. “I do think that we need to have a common narrative,” she told her members yesterday morning before the hearing, according to someone in the room. “This is a very serious event in our country. We wish it could have been avoided. None of us came here to impeach a president.”

Republicans are eager to paint impeachment as highly partisan and portray Democrats as obsessed with impeachment since Trump won the 2016 election. They displayed a poster board behind the dais yesterday to convey this message: It was a partial quote from Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who said on television earlier this year that “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get reelected.”

2) Doing the closed-door depositions in advance meant that Democrats knew what to ask and didn’t waste time beating around the bush.

Remarkably, the hearing wrapped about half an hour earlier than television producers expected, something that’s rare in a chamber with so many loquacious members who seem to enjoy hearing themselves talk.

Some House Democrats were concerned going into the hearing that it would get covered by the print media as a nothing-burger if the witnesses simply repeated on camera what they had said during their closed-door depositions that have already been released. But Taylor made news by revealing a previously undisclosed July 26 phone call between Trump and Sondland, in which the president apparently asked about “the investigations” he had sought into political rivals. Taylor understood that they were following up on the matter a day after Trump spoke with Ukraine’s new leader, Volodymyr Zelensky. “Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward,” he said. Taylor added that, after the call, his aide asked Sondland what Trump thought of Ukraine, and Sondland responded that “President Trump cares more about the investigations of [Joe] Biden.”

3) Letting the witnesses deliver long opening statements on their own terms made the hearing look less partisan.

Compare Taylor’s testimony to former special counsel Bob Mueller’s appearance before the very same committee this summer. Ironically, it was the day before Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky. Mueller clearly didn’t want to be there. He didn’t want to play along with the Democratic desire to get him to read aloud parts of his report for the benefit of a television audience. His opening statement was relatively short. And he kept his answers short.

Schiff was happy to give Taylor and Kent the floor for as long as they wanted to speak, which is unusual during a high-profile hearing like this. This allowed them to make a nonpartisan case for the importance of Ukraine to the U.S. national interest.

“Ukraine is important for our national security and we should support it — not to provide that would be folly,” said Taylor, who was appointed ambassador to Ukraine by George W. Bush and returned earlier this year at the request of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “Even as we sit here today, the Russians are attacking Ukrainian soldiers in their own country. I saw this on the front line last week.”

Taylor’s voice reminded many viewers of Walter Cronkite’s.

4) Giving a lawyer for each side 45 minutes to question the witnesses meant less grandstanding and more substance.

Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman, a former prosecutor, covered a lot of ground and kept the conversation on track. The members on the committee, meanwhile, each got five minutes. Many devoted a significant chunk of that time to offering commentary in lieu of posing questions.

Schiff, a former prosecutor as well, also gave himself the ability to redirect. After Republicans on the committee cited Zelensky’s public statements that he did not feel pressured by Trump as evidence that Trump didn’t pressure him, for example, the chairman coaxed Kent and Taylor into explaining the reasons why Zelensky might feel compelled to say that even if it wasn’t true. Both witnesses noted that Zelensky would understand that Trump could impose serious consequences should he publicly challenge his account of their interactions. They also agreed that Zelensky, still new in the job, is sensitive to domestic perception and would not want to tell his own people that he had felt like he had to capitulate to American demands.

A former George W. Bush White House press secretary spoke for many Republican strategist types when he faulted the performance of the GOP counsel:

Whatever the GOP counsel is doing, it's not working. I don't undertand where he's going. — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) November 13, 2019

It will be interesting to see how the GOP members change up their strategy in the next few hearings. Marie Yovanovitch, the ex-ambassador who got recalled, is set to testify tomorrow for the second open session. The embassy staffer who Taylor said overheard Trump ask Sondland about the investigations, David Holmes, has agreed to a closed-door deposition on Friday. Sondland is slated to testify publicly next Wednesday. His lawyer said he’ll respond to Taylor’s testimony about the July 26 call with Trump at that time. The committees involved in the inquiry also announced that they expect Mark Sandy, who oversees national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, to testify behind closed doors on Saturday. That’s significant because no other OMB staff member has shown up yet to answer questions.

5) Not waiting for legal battles to play out allowed Democrats to emphasize the degree to which Trump is still stonewalling the investigation.

Schiff has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he’s not going to let the Trump administration go “rope-a-dope,” a boxing technique to describe moving around the ring to avoid clashing. He decided not to wait for depositions with key witnesses like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney or former national security adviser John Bolton. There are court cases playing out related to the enforcement of subpoenas that Trump officials have refused to comply with. Schiff felt waiting on these to play out would delay the start of the public phase too much. Wednesday showed he didn’t need to wait.

Democrats yesterday repeatedly highlighted notes and other records that have not been turned over, including from Taylor and Kent, by the State Department. This undercut the White House talking point that there aren’t first-hand witnesses. There aren’t first-hand witnesses because they’re not being allowed to appear.

-- But, but, but: This process has already become the latest case study of the tribalism that threatens to tear the republic apart. If Democrats hold revelatory hearings but Republicans dig in and persuadable independent-minded people don’t pay attention, does it matter?

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump ally on Capitol Hill who is reportedly angling to replace Mulvaney as White House chief of staff, defended the president on Wednesday by arguing that truth itself is subjective. “I think what happens is, when we start to look at the facts, everybody has their impression of what truth is,” Meadows told reporters at the Capitol.

Whatever you think of him and the prospect of impeachment, Trump has no doubt moved the bar for what kind of presidential behavior shocks the conscience.

-- “Like virtually everything else in Washington over the past three years, even without the president in the room, this was another episode of the Trump Show — the transformation of the U.S. government into a long-running drama about one outsize personality,” Marc Fisher observes. “Even as the hearing’s spotlight stayed fixed on Trump — his phone calls, his policy shifts, his quest to find usable dirt about a leading Democratic rival — the possible removal of the president seemed to lack the potency and gravity of previous impeachments. Committee members largely steered clear of the kind of dark oratory that launched impeachment debates in 1973 and 1998 … Trump’s remarkable ability to skate through crises that wreck other people’s lives — bankruptcies of his businesses, abandoned projects, divorces and accusations of sexual misbehavior — seemed again to be at work. …

“Public opinion hasn’t settled into any consensus about whether Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart was a big deal. When a CBS News poll asked Americans this month whether Trump’s dealings with Ukraine were typical of how presidents work with foreign countries, 42 percent said Trump’s acts were ‘the kind of thing most presidents probably do,’ while 58 percent said he acted in a way that ‘few or no other presidents have.’

“On Google, searches for ‘impeachment’ topped the trending charts for much of the day, but the volume didn’t come close to the previous day’s leader: a nationwide quest for information regarding Sonic the Hedgehog, the video game character that is getting its own adventure movie next year.”

COMMENTARY FROM THE POST’S OPINION PAGE:

HOW IT’S PLAYING ON THE RIGHT:

“If you thought Robert Mueller’s pathetic testimony … was bad, well, what we saw today was even more pathetic, more desperate and actually worse,” said Fox News host Sean Hannity. “Matter of fact, it was a total ‘Schiff’ show, if you know what I mean.” Hannity called Kent and Taylor “uncompelling” and “seemingly more important than they really are.”

Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle thought the hearing fell short, calling it a “Democrat dud.”

“In a healthier political culture, Democrats would be using the Ukraine episode as an argument against Mr. Trump’s re-election. How can you trust his foreign-policy judgment in a second term when he won’t have the check of another re-election?” writes the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board. “Instead Democrats have pulled out the constitutional bazooka of impeachment. … They are turning impeachment into a routine political weapon, and future Presidents of both parties will regret it.”

“Trump’s hotels and golf courses are big, as are his rallies and his rhetoric. Too often, though, his vision of the presidency is way too small,” writes the Washington Examiner’s editorial board. “The public impeachment hearings have highlighted this myopia.”

HOW IT’S PLAYING ON THE LEFT:

“Smears and attacks by America’s enemies brought against us by other Americans working with those corrupt forces, that’s a new level of wrong for our country,” said MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.

Republicans are living in an alternate reality, writes Mother Jones’ David Corn: “The committee’s GOP members spent much of the day trying to sidestep the core facts of the controversy and replace them with conspiracy hogwash to divert attention from the incriminating evidence.”

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “I’m horrified. I’m appalled. If you had told me three years ago it would come to this, I wouldn’t have believed this. I don’t think I could have imagined a president, any president, engaging in this sort of conduct,” said conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, in a rare appearance on MSNBC.

ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN:

-- Prosecutors closed their case against Roger Stone by portraying him as a serial liar who repeatedly made false statements to Congress to protect Trump, and then engaged in a campaign to silence a witness who could expose him. Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Ann E. Marimow report: ""'Roger Stone knew if this information got out, it would look really bad for his longtime associate Donald Trump,’ Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis told jurors set to begin deliberations Thursday over whether Stone lied to House investigators two years ago about an effort to find political dirt on Trump’s Democratic opponent. … Defense attorney Bruce Rogow told jurors that Stone had no reason to lie to protect Trump … Stone’s attorneys have argued that he did not intend to lie to the committee but saw much of what they asked for as outside the scope of a probe of Russian interference. Prosecutor Michael Marando called that claim ‘nonsense.’ Stone himself, he noted, repeatedly mentioned WikiLeaks and the exposed emails in his opening statement to Hill investigators. …

“Because of Stone’s lies, Kravis said, the committee never interviewed Stone’s intermediaries or saw his correspondence, and their ‘report is not accurate’ when it says there is no evidence that he got information from WikiLeaks. Stone did not take the stand or offer witnesses in his defense. But jurors listened in court to 50 minutes of the House testimony that sparked the case. Rogow urged them to listen to the entire three-hour hearing themselves. ‘This was not the voice of a man who was trying to lie, to mislead,’ he argued. His voice also came through in four days of government testimony featuring his profane boasts and apparent threats to Randy Credico, a talk-show host who could contradict Stone’s House testimony. Credico, Kravis said, was the ‘one guy out there who can knock down this whole house of cards,’ and Stone ‘knew that could never happen.’”

-- Congress can seek eight years of Trump’s tax records, a federal appeals court ordered, moving the conflict closer to the Supreme Court. Ann E. Marimow reports: “The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit let stand an earlier ruling against the president that affirmed Congress’s investigative authority on a day when the House was holding its first public impeachment inquiry hearing. Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said in response to Wednesday’s decision that the president’s legal team ‘will be seeking review at the Supreme Court.’ The D.C. Circuit was responding to Trump’s request to have a full panel of judges rehear a three-judge decision from October that rejected the president’s request to block lawmakers from subpoenaing his longtime accounting firm. A majority of the court’s 11 active judges voted against revisiting the case. Three judges — Neomi Rao, Gregory Katsas and Karen LeCraft Henderson — indicated that they would have granted the rehearing and published dissenting statements. Rao and Katsas, both former Trump administration officials, were nominated to the bench by the president.”

-- Chad Wolf was sworn in as the new acting secretary of homeland security. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration services, will become acting deputy. Nick Miroff reports: “Cuccinelli had been Trump’s preferred choice for the top job, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) dislikes Cuccinelli, and senior Republican senators have indicated that they will not confirm him for a permanent job. Wolf replaces Kevin McAleenan, who assumed the acting DHS chief role when Trump removed Kirstjen Nielsen in April. Mc­Aleenan received the president’s praise but was never nominated for the job, and he submitted his resignation Oct. 11. … How long Wolf and Cuccinelli will be in the acting roles is unclear. White House officials say Trump does not plan to nominate Wolf for the permanent position, and some of the immigration restrictionists who back the president have criticized Wolf’s prior lobbying work on behalf of foreign companies that sought employment visas.”

-- Trump’s political appointees inappropriately retaliated against a State Department career civil servant in part because of her ethnic background, her perceived political views and the fact that she worked in government during prior administrations, according to a new report from State Department Inspector General Steve Linick. From Politico: “Linick recommends that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo consider disciplining officials found to have violated policies that require they use merit-based factors in determining where to place career staffers. … The report focuses largely on events in 2017, under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and covers five distinct cases of individuals alleged to have been subject to unfair personnel decisions due to ‘politicized and other improper’ practices. … The report was fueled in large part by Democrats’ demands after a whistleblower shared with Congress emails in which Trump political appointees and outside conservative figures appeared to plot to sideline Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, a career civil servant of Iranian descent. Nowrouzzadeh, a U.S.-born staffer who joined government during the George W. Bush administration, was abruptly taken out of the Policy Planning division of the State Department in the wake of these conversations. One of the officials involved in curtailing her detail was Brian Hook, who led the Policy Planning division at the time and is now a top Iran aide to Pompeo.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump welcomed Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House with open arms, even though the Turkish president ignored his warning a month ago to not invade northeastern Syria. David Nakamura, Karen DeYoung and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump said a tentative cease-fire is holding in northeastern Syria and thanked Erdogan for ‘his cooperation.’ He said the two leaders ‘made tremendous progress’ toward more than quadrupling bilateral trade — to $100 billion — and ‘hopefully will be able to resolve’ a conflict over Turkey’s purchase of a sophisticated Russian missile defense system. … Erdogan shared Trump’s assessment of their talks as productive, but he also took the news conference as an opportunity to list outstanding grievances. Chief among them is the U.S. failure to extradite Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, a permanent U.S. resident, who Erdogan’s government claims masterminded a 2016 coup attempt. …

“Erdogan also criticized the House’s passage last month of a resolution officially designating the 1915 Turkish slaughter of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians as genocide, something Turkey had strenuously lobbied against for years. At one point during Wednesday’s talks, Trump invited a group of Republican senators critical of Turkey to join them. ‘We’re having a very good discussion,’ Trump told reporters as Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Ted Cruz (Tex.), James E. Risch (Idaho), Rick Scott (Fla.) and Joni Ernst (Iowa) sat on couches before him and Erdogan in the Oval Office. ‘The purpose of this meeting is to have an American civics lesson with our Turkish friends,’ said Graham, who last month called on Trump to ‘stand up to Erdogan’ and branded the Turkish leader as a ‘thug.’ … Several Democratic senators [called] Trump’s decision to host Erdogan … ‘absolutely shameful,’ and some Republicans voiced similar, if more muted, concerns. ‘This is an unfortunate time, in my opinion, for the visit,’ Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) … In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he ‘shared my colleagues’ uneasiness at seeing President Erdogan honored at the White House.’”

-- Outside the White House, demonstrators angry at Erdogan chanted “Turkey out of Syria” and “Turkey is a terrorist!” Marissa J. Lang and Peter Hermann report: “The gathering came amid heightened security to avoid a repeat of Erdogan’s last visit in 2017, when clashes broke out between his security guards and a group protesting him outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence at Sheridan Circle.”

-- The U.S.-China trade talks have hit another snag, this time over farm purchases. From the Journal: “Mr. Trump has said that China has agreed to buy up to $50 billion of soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from the U.S. annually. But China is leery of putting a numerical commitment in the text of an agreement, according to people familiar with the matter. Beijing wants to avoid cutting a deal that looks more favorable to the U.S. than to China, some of the people said, and also wants to have flexibility within the agreement should trade tensions escalate again. ‘We can always stop the purchases if things get worse again,’ said one Chinese official.”

-- The deadliest form of the pneumonic plague infected at least two people in China. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “Local health officials confirmed the two cases of pneumonic plague on Tuesday, according to Xinhua News, China’s state-run news agency. The two patients, who authorities say received ‘proper treatment,’ hail from China’s Inner Mongolia region. Additional information on the patients and their health status was not available Wednesday, and it’s not clear when the cases were identified. Officials told Xinhua that ‘relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.’ … The pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease, according to the World Health Organization, and the only type that can spread from person to person through the inhalation of respiratory droplets. It is sometimes caused by untreated cases of the more common bubonic plague, and symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and rapidly developing pneumonia.”

-- An even scarier story about superbugs: Drug-resistant germs sicken about 3 million people every year in the United States and kill about 35,000, representing a much larger public health threat than previously understood, according to a long-awaited report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lena H. Sun reports: “The new estimates show that, on average, someone in the United States gets an antibiotic-resistant infection every 11 seconds, and every 15 minutes, someone dies. Bacteria, fungi and other germs that have developed a resistance to antibiotics and other drugs pose one of the gravest public health challenges and a baffling problem for modern medicine. Scientists, doctors and public health officials have warned of this threat for decades, and the new report reveals the top dangers and troubling trends. More pathogens are developing new ways of fending off drugs designed to kill them, and infections are spreading more widely outside of hospitals. No new classes of antibiotics have been introduced in more than three decades.”

-- A new report in the Lancet, a medical journal, warns that climate change -- if unchecked -- will badly compromise the health of children around the globe. From the Times: “The report compared human health consequences under two scenarios: one in which the world meets the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement and reins in emissions so that increases in global temperatures remain ‘well below 2 degrees Celsius’ by the end of the century, and one in which it does not. The report, published Wednesday, found that failing to limit emissions would lead to health problems caused by infectious diseases, worsening air pollution, rising temperatures and malnutrition. … Children are especially vulnerable partly because of their physiology. … As a result, children absorb more air pollution given their body size than an adult would in the same situation.”

-- A separate Oxford Economics report reveals that climate change may devastate the global economy even sooner and harder than feared. From Bloomberg News: “In the absence of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the earth could warm by 2 degrees Celsius by 2050, cutting global gross domestic product by 2.5% to 7.5%, Oxford estimates, with the worst affected countries being in Africa and Asia. Longer term, a rise in temperatures of 4 degrees by 2100 could cut output by as much as 30%.”

-- The rapidly warming waters in the Sea of Okhotsk, wedged between Siberia and Japan, have led to the collapse of northern Japan’s salmon population, which coincides with another alarming development: the loss of a unique blanket of sea ice that dips far below the Arctic. Simon Denyer and Chris Mooney are on the ground: “The area has warmed in some places by as much as 3 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, making it one of the fastest-warming spots in the world ... The rising temperatures are starting to shut down the single most dynamic sea ice factory on Earth. The intensity of ice generation in the northwestern Sea of Okhotsk exceeds that of any single place in the Arctic Ocean or Antarctica, and the sea ice reaches a lower latitude than anywhere else on the planet. Its decline has a cascade of consequences well beyond Japan as climate dominoes begin to fall. When sea ice forms here, it expels huge amounts of salt into the frigid water below the surface, creating some of the densest ocean water on Earth. That water then sinks and travels east, carrying oxygen, iron and other key nutrients out into the northern Pacific Ocean, where marine life depends on it. As the ice retreats, that nutrient-rich current is weakening, endangering the biological health of the vast northern Pacific — one of the most startling, and least discussed, effects of climate change so far observed.”

-- Europe’s lax speed limits once appeared irrevocable, but climate change is changing that, as well. Rick Noack reports: “After a year of major global climate protests and groundbreaking court rulings, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Wednesday grudgingly announced that his government would lower maximum daytime speed limits on many highways from about 81 mph to 62 mph. The change is part of a broader — and potentially only temporary — set of measures that are supposed to curb emissions. But they could signal a growing momentum for similar proposals across Europe that would align European maximum speed limits more with their, on average, lower U.S. equivalents.”

-- Venice isn’t the only corner of Europe experiencing serious flooding. Parts of northern England are also knee-deep in some of the worst flooding that’s hit the island in years. Miriam Berger reports: “Amid the downpour, Britain’s embattled (remember Brexit?) prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been ruefully absent in the views of many affected residents. Opposition leaders have criticized him for not declaring the situation a state of emergency, which would have accelerated help to flooding areas. On Wednesday, people had the chance to tell him off — and they did so in very stern British style. As Johnson toured flood-affected areas, residents heckled and chastised him for not coming sooner. ‘It took you over five days,’ one woman scolded Johnson, as he sat, head bowed, nursing a cup of tea. ‘You should have been there Saturday morning, having a meeting, making sure that these people get the help and support. And I’m sorry, but your announcement yesterday was a pittance.’”

-- Bolivia’s deposed president Evo Morales rejected the self-proclaimed presidency of opposition senator Jeanine Añez, but police barred his lawmakers from entering the legislature to undo it. Rachelle Krygier reports: “Añez, the second vice president of the Bolivian Senate and a Morales critic, attempted to convene the upper house Tuesday to name an interim president and discuss a path toward new elections. Other opposition leaders urged support for Añez. But [members of Morales’s MAS party], who still hold majorities in the legislature, boycotted the session. In the absence of a quorum, Añez declared herself president of the Senate, which effectively made her interim president of the country. … Bolivia’s constitutional tribunal quickly released a statement saying it was constitutional, the heads of the military and national police declared their support, and a senior U.S. State Department official recognized Añez as ‘Interim Constitutional President.’ … Añez began work Wednesday at the presidential palace, meeting with military and police commanders. She insisted that her mandate was ‘strictly temporary’ and that her only objective was to call elections as soon as possible. Under the Bolivian constitution, new elections must be held within 90 days of Morales’s resignation.”

-- Añez’s surprise move to seize the Bolivian presidency prompted a closer look at racist remarks she’s made towards the country's indigenous majority. From the Guardian: “One tweet from 2013 – later deleted – describes indigenous Aymara new year’s celebrations as ‘satanic’ and concludes: ‘Nobody can replace God!’ In another post, she questioned whether a group of indigenous people were genuine because they were wearing shoes.” Also, in a clear sign that she intends to steer Bolivia away from Morales’s socialism, one of Añez’s first acts was to recognize the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela, overturning Bolivia’s support for Nicolás Maduro.

-- A group of Guaidó supporters seized the Venezuelan Embassy in Brazil, claiming its employees defected and voluntarily let them inside. Marina Lopes reports: “But Freddy Meregote, the embassy chargé d’affaires representing the government of ... Maduro, said that the staff remains loyal to Maduro and that Guaidó supporters forced their way in. … The confrontation occurred as the leaders of Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa arrived in Brasilia for a summit to discuss the instability in Venezuela, among other issues. Brazilian police surrounded the embassy but did not enter. The standoff ended shortly after 5 p.m., as a group of at least 14 Guaidó supporters left the embassy under escort by police and members of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. They had occupied the facility for more than 12 hours.”

-- Denmark will end its 60 years of hassle-free travel at its border with Sweden, establishing new border checks in the wake of bombings by Swedish gangs. From the Times: “The measures put in place on Tuesday are temporary and will be applied intermittently, but the Danish police said that most travelers should carry passports or national identification cards. Only air travelers from Sweden will be exempted. ... Sweden has had border checks on travelers from Denmark since 2016. But the Danish passport checks come as its neighbor has been rocked by more than 100 explosions in the first 10 months of this year. Officials have blamed the blasts — up from 39 at the same time last year — on criminal gangs. The explosions have spread to Denmark, where at least 13 have occurred in Copenhagen this year, although the police have not linked them all to Sweden.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, joined the Democratic presidential race today. Matt Viser reports: Patrick “jumped into the Democratic presidential contest, asserting that he wanted to build ‘a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American Dream’ and acknowledging the difficulty his late start creates in achieving that goal. ‘I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field; they bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,’ he said in a video released Thursday. … After registering for the ballot in New Hampshire later Thursday, Patrick plans to head to California, a state that falls early in the primary calendar and has a wealth of delegates. … Patrick has political strengths and an ability to deliver such soaring oratory that President Barack Obama was accused of taking lines from a 2006 speech of his. He became a two-term governor using an uplifting life story and an aspirational political brand, traits that his allies say could serve him well in a presidential campaign. … It was unclear whether Patrick had spoken with [Elizabeth] Warren, the U.S. senator from his home state and someone whose political rise he helped in 2012 when he defended her against questions about her claims of Native American heritage.”

-- Meanwhile, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is still deciding whether to run for president, but he will definitely not appear on the primary ballot in New Hampshire. From CBS News: “Bloomberg does not plan to file to be on the ballot for the Democratic contest as in the first-in-the-nation primary in the Granite State, an aide [says]. ... There is no word yet on whether the former mayor plans to file to appear on the ballot in the other early contest states. Iowa, which holds the first caucus, doesn't have a ballot filing deadline because it uses the caucus system.”

-- Elizabeth Warren bought time on CNBC to run a commercial blasting billionaires. From the Times: “In a new TV ad, Ms. Warren singles out a series of billionaires who have spoken out against her, showing footage of them and repeating her call for a wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans. The ad, set to air Thursday on CNBC in New York City and Washington, is the latest volley in the back-and-forth between Ms. Warren and the country’s billionaires — or at least an outspoken handful of them who have criticized her publicly. … ‘It is time for a wealth tax in America,’ Ms. Warren says in the ad, which shows her speaking at a recent town hall event. ‘I’ve heard that there are some billionaires who don’t support this plan.’”

-- Former housing secretary Julián Castro will miss the November debate. From Politico: “Ten candidates are projected to participate in the debate cohosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post on Nov. 20 in Atlanta, according to Politico’s tracking of public polling and donor figures: [Biden], Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, [Warren] and Andrew Yang. … Castro is not the only active candidate who missed out on the debate stage. Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, John Delaney and Marianne Williamson all participated in earlier debates but will not qualify for the November debate. Joe Sestak and Wayne Messam have never qualified for a debate and will not be on stage next week, either.”

-- After his heart attack, Bernie Sanders has adopted a more wholesome regimen, taking long walks and eating salads. From the Times: Jane ""Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. ‘I’ve noticed him ordering a heck of a lot more salads,’ said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager. Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. In the six weeks since he suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders has been working hard to move past his health issues, adhering to a newly wholesome regimen that has included more exercise and a healthier diet.”

-- Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are introducing a Green New Deal bill for public housing. Renae Merle and David Weigel report: The legislation will “give the country’s public housing units an energy-efficiency overhaul, their first attempt at turning the Green New Deal’s broad framework into specific policy. The bill … would use seven grant programs to upgrade housing units into carbon-neutral communities with organic grocery stores, on-site child care and community gardens. Residents of public housing would be given preference in hiring to renovate those units. ... The bill would cost between $119 billion and $172 billion over the next decade, according to estimates developed by Data for Progress, a progressive think tank. It would create up to 240,723 jobs a year, the group estimated. … Ocasio-Cortez’s new legislation is far less expensive than an upgrade of all housing, or the other aspects of the Green New Deal that spooked Democrats. But it could meet resistance from [Pelosi], who has signaled she will adopt ‘pay-as-you-go’ rules requiring that any new spending be paid for or offset. Progressive Democrats have objected to that requirement and said deficit spending is sometimes necessary.”

-- Echoing Washington, the student body president of the University of Florida faces impeachment after bringing Donald Trump Jr. to campus for $50,000. Meagan Flynn reports: “The student body president, Michael Murphy, was served with the impeachment resolution and accused of malfeasance and abuse of power … For Trump, the key piece of evidence is his July phone call with the Ukrainian president — but for Murphy, it’s an email, a short exchange with a Trump campaign consultant that his critics say is proof of misconduct. The group of senators seeking Murphy’s impeachment argue that the Oct. 10 speaking engagement for Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle, his girlfriend, was funded with mandatory student fees in violation of rules banning the use of public students funds to support or oppose a ‘political party at any level.’ In the eyes of critics, Murphy’s correspondence with the Trump fundraising consultant ahead of the event bolsters their case that Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle’s appearance was a campaign event.”

Obama did not name any candidates. But some Democrats associate the characteristics he described with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), staunch liberal candidates advocating sweeping change who are running near the top of the polls.

Beyond those two candidates, the contest has often been dominated by a discussion of ideas that were long seen as untenable, even in Democratic circles. Candidates have called for mandatory buybacks of certain firearms, decriminalizing border crossings and forgiving most or all student debt. In some cases, the proposals have come at a cost of tens of trillions of dollars, vast sums of money that would dwarf what Obama’s administration spent and require historically steep tax increases on wealthy Americans. While some voters and activists have cheered this trend, President Trump and his allies have been eager to highlight these themes.

However, Obama also warned the candidates against simply standing pat and campaigning on his accomplishments. Instead, he argued, they should try to “push past” them with new ideas. He pointed to his signature health-care law, which has been a focal point in the contest, as a prime example, calling it a “really good starter home.”

AD

AD

Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, has campaigned aggressively on expanding the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program, as has South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another top candidate.

That has put them at odds with Warren and Sanders, who favor implementing a new Medicare-for-all system that would insure everyone through the government.

Obama did not indicate a preference Friday.

The former president seemed to be urging a balance between striving for bold new ideas and being in touch with voters’ concerns. While it is the role of activists to push for dramatic change, Obama said, candidates should aim to win elections.

AD

“My point is that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party,” he said.

AD

The 44th president has been careful about commenting publicly about the contest. He has not spoken about it often, even as he has frequently met with and counseled the candidates in private over the past couple of years.

He said he has advised all of them to ask themselves the same basic questions: Why me? How will this impact my loved ones? And can I win?

AD

The last question is one that has increasingly given Democratic donors anxiety as they assess the field. This week, it grew with the addition of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, a staunch Obama ally who entered the race saying that neither the path trod by Biden nor Sanders and Warren “seizes the moment” in a way that insures a defeat for Trump. Meanwhile, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg also has taken steps toward running.

AD

The 11th-hour moves reflect a primary unsettled by the fears of many Democrats worried that Trump will seize a second term. Obama urged them to not to be fretful.

“For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,” he said, prompting laughter in the audience. He reminded those in attendance of his grueling 2008 battle with Hillary Clinton, which played out months before he won the presidency.

AD

“We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service,” Obama said. “And whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president.”

Even as he remains neutral in the primary, Obama is stepping deeper into the campaign. Next week, he will appear at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Silicon Valley.

AD

The president spoke Friday in what was billed as a “fireside chat” with Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and a rising star in the party. Obama praised Abrams and the work she is doing on voting rights with her recently launched organization.

As he concluded the roughly 45-minute discussion, Obama offered a final word of advice for the party’s White House hopefuls.

“We have the better argument,” Obama said. “We can’t be arrogant about it. We can’t take for granted that somehow people, just, you know, the scales will fall from their eyes at some point.”

This week, Elizabeth Warren attempted to cut the Medicare for All baby in half. Will it work? Political columnist Ed Kilgore joined me to discuss the merits of political incrementalism.

Ben: On Friday, Elizabeth Warren released a health-care proposal that seemed to acknowledge that she had put herself in a difficult position by previously adopting a Medicare for All–or-bust approach. In her new plan, her administration would quickly work to pass a Medicare public option — similar to but more generous than the ones being floated by the likes of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. Only in year three of her tenure would Warren turn to shifting the entire system to Medicare, doing away with private insurance. Does this strike you as a well-thought-out proposal? And do you think it’s smart politically?

Ed: Sort-of yes, and definitely yes. Not sure I’d treat this as some sort of flip-flop, though; I don’t remember her clearly saying she was adopting Bernie’s all-or-nothing timetable, though she has refused — and is still refusing — to make the whole enchilada a matter for mañana. Under this new plan, the final push would supposedly happen by her third year in office. But for those of us who, you know, live on planet Earth, the idea that Congress was going to enact a full M4A proposal in 2021 was always hallucinatory.

Ben: Is it much less hallucinatory to think that they’d do so in 2023?

Ed: Well, the idea is that Americans would finally get to see the contrast between the old and new systems, which would dispel their fears about losing private coverage. I don’t think it will happen that fast, if it happens at all. And there’s another problem with this timetable: She’s talking about the second, whole-enchilada bill passing by year three, which could mean right after a first midterm in which all but one president since FDR has lost strength in Congress.

Still, her plan would leave something pretty big and valuable in place. Not that the first bill will be a piece of cake, particularly if Democrats don’t win the Senate next year. Bernie’s plan implicitly says we’re stuck with the status quo (aside, I suppose, for whatever he can do administratively) until Medicare for All passes, though he has co-sponsored all sorts of incremental proposals in the past.

Ben: Pete Buttigieg’s campaign put out a statement attacking Warren’s proposal. An excerpt: “Senator Warren’s new health-care ‘plan’ is a transparently political attempt to paper over a very serious policy problem, which is that she wants to force 150 million people off their private insurance — whether they like it or not.” Buttigieg and others have gotten mileage out of contrasting themselves with Warren on health care, since most Americans prefer the idea of a public option over full-on Medicare for All right now. But will their jabs be less effective now that Warren has pivoted to the center a bit?

Ed: Well, Pete has shifted over time from the default position of many progressives treating M4A as the ultimate goal — which he once embraced — to a fairly hard-core defense of individual choice. Doesn’t sound like he thinks M4A in any form will ever be a good idea. But yes, to the extent Warren isn’t talking about abolishing private insurance until this sort of trial period of, well, “Medicare if you want it,” makes his attacks less effective. Pete, of course, is denying that Warren has “pivoted to the center.” Bernie Twitter sure is treating her as having moved into Satanic centrist territory, but I don’t believe Bernie himself has said anything just yet.

Ben: Haha. Does it matter much that it’s taken her a while to get to this point? Do you think voters who were hesitant to get onboard with her because of her previous health-care posture might give her a second look now?

Ed: It’s never been clear to me how much actual voters have been paying attention to this particular sub-debate. But in my mind it reinforces Warren’s claims to be hardheaded about political realities. She favors abolishing the filibuster — which is likely the only way a full M4A could ever be enacted — and is trying to design a first bill that can pass via budget reconciliation, which means 50 votes plus a veep. Bernie opposes killing the filibuster, and is still arguing that some sort of pixie-dust “political revolution” will make it happen.

Ben: Do you imagine that if the Democrats manage to win the Senate (which is an uphill battle) and the pivotal votes are then true moderates like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, that they’ll even give the green light to a public option in the face of what would be enormous pressure from the Democratic base? In other words, does even this incremental change have a good chance of happening?

Ed: It has a chance; not 100 percent how “good” that chance is. You could theoretically flip a Republican or two on an incremental bill, which would probably poll well. Most likely, a President Warren would have to compromise (like Obama did), and accept half of her half-a-loaf bill. That could, of course, be great news for many millions of Americans, and as she suggests, increase support for going the whole hog. If I’m not mistaken, Warren’s argument all along has been “you don’t get anything unless you demand exactly what you want.” That implies that once you’ve fought for your plan, you will eventually accept less if that’s all you can get. Nice to see her articulate a proposal that reflects that reality. This won’t, of course, keep Joe Biden from saying that she’s disrespecting Barack Obama’s legacy. I’m pretty sure the only reason Biden’s plan builds on Obamacare is so that he can say the word “Obama” a few more times a minute."

Among the many factors that contributed to Hillary Clinton’s shocking defeat in 2016, one pretty much everyone agrees upon (though not necessarily about its relative significance) is a falloff in African-American turnout relative to 2012. The numbers are clear, as Politico reported in 2017:

The Census’ Current Population Survey, released Wednesday, shows 65 percent of white citizens cast ballots in last year’s presidential election, up from 64 percent four years earlier.

But the turnout rate among African-American citizens tumbled sharply, the survey shows. Only 59 percent of black citizens voted in 2016, down from 66 percent in 2012 and 65 percent in 2008.

Those national numbers may underestimate the size and impact of lower black turnout in individual battleground states, as Osita Nwanevu observed:

Crucially, the drop in black turnout was even sharper in states where the margin of victory was less than 10 points than it was nationally — in those battleground states, black turnout dropped 5.3 points. In two critical states that swung to Trump — Michigan and Wisconsin — black turnout dropped by just more than 12 points. Declines were less dramatic but significant in other swing states Trump carried: Ohio (down 7.5 points), Florida (4.2), and Pennsylvania (2.1). White turnout declined modestly in each of those swing states but Florida and Pennsylvania, where it increased by 3.5 points and 5.2 points respectively. Clinton lost each of those swing states but Ohio by a margin of less than 2 points.

Conversely, a return to higher black turnout could be a key element in toppling Trump next year. In a major study from the Center for American Progress, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin project that natural demographic trends in the last four years plus a return to 2012 levels of African-American voting would flip four states — Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — and give Democrats a 294-244 majority in the Electoral College. And even if black voting turnout doesn’t quite hit those levels, in many states even marginal changes in turnout and Democratic vote-share could make the difference in a close race.

Will black turnout rebound to 2012 automatically after nearly three years of the most openly racist president since Woodrow Wilson? That’s unclear. In the 2018 midterms African-American turnout rose 10.8 percent as compared to the last midterm in 2014, as compared to an 11.7 boost in white turnout. And there’s also some evidence (though it’s at best mixed) that Trump is marginally more popular with black voters now than he was in 2016, though he remains overwhelmingly unpopular.

The most obvious factor to which to attribute the 2012-2016 falloff in African-American turnout is the absence at the top of the ticket of the first African-American president. 2016 black turnout, in fact, returned to its pre-Obama, 2004 levels. What’s hard to calculate is whether the 2008-2012 turnout boom was a unique event attributable to Obama’s pioneering status (much like the sky-high margins John F. Kennedy won among Catholics in 1960 or Jimmy Carter’s big wins in the Deep South in 1976), or could be replicated by another African-American at the top of the ticket in 2020 or beyond.

There is some suggestive evidence that black candidates still matter with black voters. The Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman noted that in the 2019 off-year elections in Mississippi, the white (and culturally conservative) Democratic gubernatorial nominee didn’t generate very robust African-American turnout as compared to the moderate black Senate candidate who ran in a 2018 special election:

[T]urnout in Mississippi was down from last November’s special Senate election, when GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith defeated Democrat Mike Espy 54 percent to 46 percent. The reason? Hood, a conservative white Democrat who had long served as the state’s attorney general, failed to mobilize Mississippi’s black voters to the same extent as Espy, who is African American and had represented the Mississippi Delta in Congress in the 1990s.

In Mississippi counties where white residents outnumber African Americans, 2019 turnout was down just 3 percent versus last fall and Hood took 39 percent, up from Espy’s 37 percent. But in Mississippi counties where African American residents outnumber whites, 2019 turnout was down 8 percent and Hood took just 68 percent, down from Espy’s 69 percent. In Jackson’s Hinds County, the largest in the state, turnout was down 11 percent.

On the other hand, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that in the 2020 Democratic presidential nominating contest, two African-American senators whose résumés compare favorably to Obama’s when he first ran are really struggling with black voters. In a recent Monmouth poll of South Carolina, where roughly 60 percent of the primary electorate is African-American (and where Obama romped to a landslide win over Hillary Clinton in 2008), the top-polling black candidate, Kamala Harris, is losing the black vote to Joe Biden by a 39-8 margin. In fact, Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are all beating Harris among black voters. And Cory Booker is mired in the low single digits in South Carolina. Both Harris and Booker have been forced to go all-in on the Iowa Caucuses in an effort to impress black voters later in the schedule that they are viable. And they aren’t doing well there, either. A third on-paper-viable black candidate, Deval Patrick, joined the contest, but this corporate-oriented former governor of a very white state has a lot to prove to black and white voters alike.

Biden’s strong position among black voters at present is a living refutation of another theory: that Democrats can energize African-Americans with an aggressively progressive agenda aimed at addressing economic inequality and institutional racism. Black Democrats are more likely to self-identify as “moderate” than are white Democrats. And ideology aside, a self-conscious pitch to black voters may not work for a candidate who for whatever reason doesn’t resonate with the target: Pete Buttigieg has an impressive agenda for black empowerment he calls the “Douglass Plan.” His African-American following remains very small.

So what are Democrats to do?

It might help if they less conspicuously obsess about other potentially conflicting constituencies like white working-class voters and normally Republican white suburbanites. Traditional base mobilization strategies that have been effective among black voters in the past should get attention and plenty of money.

But perhaps the single best way for Democrats (or if they were willing to do so, Republicans) to boost black turnout is to fight like hell for their right and their opportunity to vote. With voter-suppression efforts ongoing in Republican-governed states all over the country, it’s a target-rich environment for Democratic pols and party leaders to show some serious solidarity with the voters they want to turn out on their own behalf.

If, God forbid, I was in charge of a currently successful Democratic presidential campaign supporting a white candidate, I would whisper into the ear of my boss the idea that she or he should not only consider but perhaps announce early a ticket that includes Georgia 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams. She is African-American and a moderate on most issues, and above all, has devoted herself to voting rights and knows everything there is to know about mobilizing minority voters. If there’s a way to reach Obama-like levels of black turnout in 2020, there’s no one more likely to figure out how to do it, and then to do it."

For almost a full year now, Barack Obama has gone out of his way to avoid commenting on 2020’s presidential primary. He doesn’t sit for interviews where he might be asked about it, he won’t mention candidates’ names, and even in private, he often changes the topic when friends try to get his take on the state of the race. Insofar as he has sought any role in the process, he preferred that it be as a detached advisor to contenders who request his big-picture guidance — he never wanted voters thinking he was trying to sway the contest. Lately, however, a very specific, very influential slice of the Democratic Party has been losing its mind, and Obama determined his role would have to change. So, on Friday evening, he climbed onto a stage in a basement ballroom in Washington’s Mandarin Oriental hotel and asked his party’s liberal elite to chill out a bit.

“We have a field of very accomplished, very serious, and passionate, and smart people who have a history of public service, and whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president,” he told the room of a few hundred of the party’s biggest donors and top strategists, gathered for a conference of the Democracy Alliance group.

The room was populated by the Warren-leaning version of the kind of people, Obama knew, that have recently been wearing out their loafers searching for a savior candidate, constantly fretting about electability, and seeding a national conversation that has borne the recent, late entries of Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick into the race. So maybe it was appropriate that it was here, after nearly three years of detachment from workaday politics, that Obama signaled for the first time a willingness to try and modulate his party’s debate — in this case to a less frantic tenor. “To those who get stressed about robust primaries,” he added, fully embodying this new slightly exasperated adult-in-the-room role, “I just have to remind you: I had a very robust primary.”

Yet Obama’s remarks were not only aimed at the donors and chatterers. He had a sterner-than-usual warning for the campaigns, too. While over the last year-plus he has been sparing in weighing in on individual primary flash points, here he cast himself as understanding but concerned emissary to what he perceives as political reality. “This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,” he said. “The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.” In Obama’s telling, Americans are conservative, not in ideology, but in temperament.

“Voters, including Democrats, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain left-leaning Twitter feeds, or the activist wing of our party,” he warned. “And that’s not a criticism to the activist wing — their job is to poke and prod and text and inspire and motivate. But the candidate’s job, whoever that ends up being, is to get elected.”

It’s a vision that clashes with some on his party’s left, most obviously including supporters of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And while he dismissed the debate between persuading voters and energizing base Democrats as “a false division,” he explained that he’d been thinking about how the candidates have been talking about him on the trail. “I think it is important for candidates to push past what I was able to achieve as president. I wouldn’t run the same campaign today, in this environment, as I ran in 2008, in part because we made enough progress since 2008, of which I am very proud, that it moved what’s possible. So I don’t want people to just revert to what’s safe, I want them to push out and try more, alright? So we got the Affordable Care Act. It was a really good starter home, as I say,” he said. “I don’t want people just standing pat, because we still have millions of people who are uninsured.”

“I don’t take it as a criticism when people say, ‘Hey, that’s great Obama did what he did, and now we want to do more.’ I hope so. That’s the whole point,” he said. “I think it is very important to all the candidates who are running, at every level, to pay some attention to where voters actually are, and how they think about their lives. And I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a bold enough proposal, and as soon as they hear a bold enough proposal that’s going to activate them. Because you know what? It turns out people are cautious, because they don’t have a margin for error.”

Onstage, Obama stuck to most of his personal Trump-era rules: He didn’t mention the president, or the news of the day — in this case the impeachment hearings. He didn’t mention any of the presidential candidates by name, either. But his remarks, delivered onstage next to Stacey Abrams, painted the clearest picture yet of Obama’s view of the primary, and of the direction of his party in the Trump era. And his timing sent as much of a message to the operatives in the room, and the candidates in the race, as his words.

Within the last week, Bloomberg let it be known he was closing in on a run (on which Obama got no heads-up), a decision largely made as a result of weakness the former New York City mayor perceives in Joe Biden’s campaign. And just a day before Obama addressed the donors, his friend Patrick surprisingly filed for the New Hampshire primary, a year after initially ruling it out. That move produced a chorus of speculative whispers in Washington about Obama’s possible role — some of the former president’s friends began suspecting this was in the cards late this summer after Patrick quietly told the Obama Foundation of his intention to leave its board. But despite their regular conversations, Patrick in fact only informed Obama of his final plan to run this week, according to Democrats familiar with the discussions.

Obama himself has said in other private talks that he thinks it’s rather late in the game for any new candidate to enter the contest. In private earlier this year he praised both Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke, but he also spoke more often about people who represent the future of the party — like, in his mind, Abrams and Andrew Gillum — than the presidential race. His political allies, meanwhile, remain scattered across the primary field, with former top aides peppering the senior ranks of all the serious campaigns.

And while perhaps Obama’s closest confidant, Valerie Jarrett, is a longtime Patrick booster, she told me on Friday that she told the former Massachusetts governor the same thing she said to all the candidates who asked: that he needed “first, a clear notion as to why you’re the best person for the job. And we talked about the challenges of a late entry, we talked about did he have the fire in his belly to do this, and did his family have the ability to make the sacrifices that were necessary? And, having been through this twice with the Obamas, is this something you are uniquely qualified to do?”

Then, like her old boss, Jarrett made sure to note, “The field is strong. We have an embarrassment of riches in the Democratic Party right now.”"

Obama did not name any candidates. But some Democrats associate the characteristics he described with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), staunch liberal candidates advocating sweeping change who are running near the top of the polls.

Beyond those two candidates, the contest has often been dominated by a discussion of ideas that were long seen as untenable, even in Democratic circles. Candidates have called for mandatory buybacks of certain firearms, decriminalizing border crossings and forgiving most or all student debt. In some cases, the proposals have come at a cost of tens of trillions of dollars, vast sums of money that would dwarf what Obama’s administration spent and require historically steep tax increases on wealthy Americans. While some voters and activists have cheered this trend, President Trump and his allies have been eager to highlight these themes.

However, Obama also warned the candidates against simply standing pat and campaigning on his accomplishments. Instead, he argued, they should try to “push past” them with new ideas. He pointed to his signature health-care law, which has been a focal point in the contest, as a prime example, calling it a “really good starter home.”

Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, has campaigned aggressively on expanding the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program, as has South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another top candidate.

That has put them at odds with Warren and Sanders, who favor implementing a new Medicare-for-all system that would insure everyone through the government.

Obama did not indicate a preference Friday.

The former president seemed to be urging a balance between striving for bold new ideas and being in touch with voters’ concerns. While it is the role of activists to push for dramatic change, Obama said, candidates should aim to win elections.

AD

“My point is that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party,” he said.

AD

The 44th president has been careful about commenting publicly about the contest. He has not spoken about it often, even as he has frequently met with and counseled the candidates in private over the past couple of years.

He said he has advised all of them to ask themselves the same basic questions: Why me? How will this impact my loved ones? And can I win?

AD

The last question is one that has increasingly given Democratic donors anxiety as they assess the field. This week, it grew with the addition of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, a staunch Obama ally who entered the race saying that neither the path trod by Biden nor Sanders and Warren “seizes the moment” in a way that insures a defeat for Trump. Meanwhile, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg also has taken steps toward running.

AD

The 11th-hour moves reflect a primary unsettled by the fears of many Democrats worried that Trump will seize a second term. Obama urged them to not to be fretful.

“For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,” he said, prompting laughter in the audience. He reminded those in attendance of his grueling 2008 battle with Hillary Clinton, which played out months before he won the presidency.

AD

“We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service,” Obama said. “And whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president.”

Even as he remains neutral in the primary, Obama is stepping deeper into the campaign. Next week, he will appear at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Silicon Valley.

AD

The president spoke Friday in what was billed as a “fireside chat” with Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and a rising star in the party. Obama praised Abrams and the work she is doing on voting rights with her recently launched organization.

As he concluded the roughly 45-minute discussion, Obama offered a final word of advice for the party’s White House hopefuls.

“We have the better argument,” Obama said. “We can’t be arrogant about it. We can’t take for granted that somehow people, just, you know, the scales will fall from their eyes at some point.”

She issued a series of plans covering things such as child care and college costs and housing, ambitious and costly initiatives that she said would pay for with a new wealth tax on people with fortunes of $50 million or more. She promises to take on the big banks and drug companies and the tech giants. She supports political reforms that would diminish the power of special interests and big money in politics.

One piece was always missing in those early days. That was a health-care plan. Warren has sought to bring rigor to her policy proposals, and as every candidate and president has learned, health care is the knottiest, most complex and seemingly insoluble of the big issues. She seemed in no rush to put her own stamp on a plan until she was ready.

Like all the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, she shared the goal of assuring universal and affordable health-care coverage to all Americans. She was for Medicare-for-all rhetorically but hesitated to offer her own distinctive plan, perhaps knowing that this could be a 10-year project and one that might be done in small steps or in a big bang.

AD

AD

During a CNN town hall meeting in March, she said, “When we talk about Medicare-for-all, there are a lot of different pathways. What we’re all looking for is the lowest-cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.”

She took a fateful step away from that position during the first Democratic debate in June in Miami. Asked by NBC News’s Lester Holt who would support eliminating private insurance, she raised her hand. Moments later, she cast her lot with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has long been the most vocal advocate of replacing the current employer-based insurance system with a single-payer government-managed system. “I’m with Bernie on Medicare-for-all,” she said that night.

That helped to widen a fault line in the Democratic field between those like Warren and Sanders, who were calling for the elimination of private insurance, and those like former vice president Joe Biden and others, who proposed building on the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option but not jettisoning the current structure.

AD

AD

Warren further isolated herself by declining to explain how she would pay for Medicare-for-all — in contrast with Sanders. The senator readily acknowledged that, under his proposal, middle-class families would pay higher taxes. But he argued that the shift to a single-payer system would result in lower overall costs to those families for their health-care coverage and therefore was well worth it.

Warren, under repeated questioning and criticism from her rivals, would not answer directly. She tried to deflect by saying that she would not sign a plan that would mean higher health-care costs for middle-class Americans. To her critics and even some of her supporters, it was an evasive and unsatisfying answer, particularly coming from someone who had detailed answers to questions about her other proposals.

Then a few weeks ago, just before a big Iowa Democratic Party fundraising dinner that drew all the candidates, Warren answered her critics by issuing a financing plan for Medicare-for-all. She had experts who vouched for the soundness of the financing plan, but other experts picked it apart as unrealistic, based on some overly rosy assumptions. To the broader audience of Democrats, it didn’t pass muster.

AD

AD

For those with doubts about her viability as a general election candidate, the proposal only added to their worries. Politically it fell far short of what she might have hoped. It opened her up to fresh charges that she was advocating a health-care plan that lacks majority support in the country and didn’t have a sound plan to pay for it.

Many in her party worried that if she became the nominee, she would be handing President Trump’s reelection campaign ammunition on an issue — health care — that long has been more favorable to Democrats

Conversations with Democrats over the past two weeks have underscored the degree to which the whole issue was becoming a potential obstacle to a campaign that otherwise has been doing many things right. “It froze a lot of people,” a still-uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat said last weekend.

AD

AD

Warren has prided herself on being a fighter for the causes she believes in, and she and her campaign team have aggressively pushed her health-care plan, even at the doorstep with voters. One Democrat said that a Warren field organizer knocked on his door recently and during the conversation initiated a defense of her plan and explained why she could win a general election with that position.

All of which makes what Warren did on Friday potentially significant. In short, she said that in her first 100 days she would try to enact legislation that would allow, but not require, Americans to purchase a government health-care plan — in other words, a public option akin but not identical to those proposed by Biden; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); and others.

Warren also said that she would wait until the third year of her presidency to begin to enact a Medicare-for-all plan, a more gradual approach than she had seemingly described in the past and one would allow her to try to build public support before plunging into something as daunting as this would be.

AD

AD

Warren will try to argue that the changes she proposes during the transition period are more ambitious than those of her rivals, in keeping with her pledge to be the candidate of big structural change. But she already has come under criticism for a change in positions and will face many more in the weeks ahead as she tries to explain the evolution of her thinking.

What Warren did on Friday could help to ease the fears of Democrats that she would be a vulnerable general-election candidate advocating positions that are politically unpalatable. But she is a long way from becoming the nominee. Medicare-for-all proved to be a problem for her and, while she may be on slightly safer ground today than a week ago, she hasn’t fully solved the problem.

The Policies

BLAME GAME: President Trump has so far failed to follow through on his vow to secure tougher gun laws in the wake of this summer's mass shootings that killed dozens. The latest rationale from Republicans: The House's impeachment inquiry makes it impossible.

“Unfortunately, our discussions on the legislative aspects of this have been sidetracked because of the impeachment process on the Hill, and so we are going forward with all the operational steps that we can take that do not require legislative action,” Attorney General William P. Barr said at Wednesday event in Memphis, according to CNN's David Shortell. “Right now it does not appear that things in Washington are amenable to those kinds of negotiations and compromises.”

and so we are going forward with all the operational steps that we can take that do not require legislative action,” Attorney General William P. Barr said at Wednesday event in Memphis, according to CNN's David Shortell. What Barr did not mention: Trump, who called for imposing “meaningful” background checks this summer and finding ways to prevent those with mental illnesses from obtaining firearms, never offered a specific proposal. And the White House distanced itself from supporting aggressive legislation after blowback from conservative members -- all before the start of the impeachment investigation.

Stark imagery: A school shooter opened fire in Santa Clarita, Calif., leaving two students dead yesterday -- right as a Republican senator blocked an effort from Democrats to expand background checks.

News of the wrenching scene broke as Connecticut Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy made an emotional appeal to their colleagues on the Senate floor to pass universal background checks — making it at least the seventh shooting to occur on school grounds since the start of this academic year, according to our colleagues Mia Nakaji Monnier, Crystal Duan, Moriah Balingit and Katie Mettler.

“We can't go 24 hours without news of another mass shooting somewhere in America. My kids and millions others hide in corners of their classroom or in their bathrooms preparing for a mass shooting at their school, and this body does nothing about it,” said Murphy.

said Murphy. The gun background check bill was blocked by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), who objected to the unanimous consent request and argued that the bill should not be “exempt from consideration by the appropriate committee of jurisdiction,” per CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi.

Waiting on the White House: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also blamed the impeachment inquiry for the lack of legislative progress. “Impeachment has sucked all the oxygen out. But I hope we will revisit. I really do. I am ready to do something yesterday,”

But …: He added that Senate Republicans were “waiting on the White House” for guidance, according to ABC's Mary Bruce.

according to ABC's Mary Bruce. Graham told reporters that “there is bipartisan support for one part of a gun control package — a grant program that encourages states to set up 'red flag' programs that allow law enforcement officers to preemptively seize a person’s firearms if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others,” report BuzzFeed's Paul McLeod and Kadia Goba.

Republicans will likely be waiting a while …: Trump “has abandoned the idea of releasing proposals to combat gun violence that his White House debated for months following mass shootings in August,” White House officials and lawmakers told our colleague Josh Dawsey earlier this month. It's a “reversal from the summer when the president insisted he would offer policies to curb firearm deaths.”

The impeachment factor: “Trump has been counseled by political advisers, including campaign manager Brad Parscale and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, that gun legislation could splinter his political coalition, which he needs to stick together for his reelection bid, particularly amid an impeachment battle,” according to Josh.

” Dan Eberhart, a major GOP donor who told Josh that Trump is better off ignoring proposals for the time being. “I suspect that was the plan all along.” Trump was also “pressed repeatedly by NRA President Wayne LaPierre this summer and early fall to not propose any gun-control measures,” per Josh.

… And Democrats might, too: “I wish this weren’t the case, but Republicans’ interest in working on guns is driven by casualties of 15 or more. It’s so awful that it works like this,” Murphy said. “I don’t doubt that we’ll be back in a conversation about background checks, but it probably won’t happen until there’s another epic-scale shooting.”

By the numbers: Since the Columbine High massacre in 1999, more than 233,000 children at 243 schools across the United States have been exposed to gun violence during school hours, per The Washington Post's database of school shootings.

The NRA spent $54,398,558 to influence federal elections in 2016



In 2018, that number dropped to $9,551,320



How much will the influential group spend in 2020?

Barr's plan: Barr introduced a proposal on Wednesday “that would better enforce the U.S. gun background check system, coordinate state and federal gun cases and ensure prosecutors quickly update databases to show when a defendant can’t possess a firearm because of mental health issues,” per the Associated Press's Adrian Sainz and Michael Balsamo.

Known as Project Guardian, Barr unveiled it at his Memphis event the same day public impeachment hearings began in Washington.

The details: “As part of the program, U.S. prosecutors will coordinate with state and local law enforcement officials to consider potential federal charges when a suspect is arrested for weapons possession, is believed to have used a gun to commit a violent crime or drug-trafficking offense or is suspected of being a violent gang member,” Sainz and Balsamo report.

By contrast: The House in February to amend federal gun laws to require background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers — and extend the amount of time for the government to complete a background check on someone trying to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, from three days to 10 days.

Barr got blowback after news of Trump's efforts to explore expanding background checks leaked: “A leaked document outlining one Trump administration proposal to expand background checks on firearms sales prompted an uproar from the right [in September] — underscoring the significant challenges the White House will face on any additional gun restrictions it tries to advance in Congress,” our colleagues Seung Min Kim, Paul Kane, and Josh reported at the time.

ON THE TRAIL: Democratic 2020 candidates sought to keep pressure on Republicans throughout the day. Sen. Kamala Harris called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to reconvene the Senate to vote on the background check bill that already passed the House.

“We’ve all been together saying Mitch McConnell needs to convene the Senate,” Harris said on MSNBC. “We have a good bill that recognizes that we don’t need to take everyone’s gun, but we need to have smart gun safety laws … there’s been a failure of the United States Congress to have the courage to act. It is pathetic. It is pathetic, that people yield to a gun lobby on an issue that affects all our children.”

Former U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch departs after testifying in a closed-door deposition on Oct. 11. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)

On The Hill

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING: We'll be watching former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who not only saw firsthand Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associates' private efforts to influence U.S. foreign policy to Ukraine but experienced it. Despite praise from fellow diplomats and even some White House officials, Yovanovitch was ousted amid a smear campaign to undermine her, our colleagues Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger report.

Who is Yovanovitch?: A 33-year career diplomat, Yovanovitch has served under presidents of both parties. She was born in Canada in to parents who fled the Soviet Union, has worked as a diplomat in seven countries and previously served as ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia.

What she'll say: Her public testimony this morning “is expected to showcase how what appears to have begun as the personal crusade of private individuals became intertwined with efforts to use Ukraine to benefit Trump politically,” our colleagues write. Democrats also expect Yovanovitch to provide a visceral retelling of what is was like to watch her own president later attack her in a call with another foreign leader.

A moment of reckoning on gender: “The symbolism of that conflict underscores the significance of the historic probe, which was initiated by the female speaker of the House — Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — and made possible by female voters who helped deliver the House to Democrats in the last election,” our colleague Elise Viebeck reports.

How does she connect to the July 25 phone call?: Yovanovitch was ousted in April months before Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but many of same figures who pushed for Trump to remove her are central characters in the impeachment inquiry, including Giuliani and his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have since been charged with campaign finance crimes.

So why did they want her gone then?: Yovanovitch's efforts to push Ukraine to fight corruption appear to have angered a number of powerful Ukrainian politicians. But as our colleagues write, Guiliani displeasure mounted when the State Department refused to grant a visa to former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.

Joe Biden, as vice president, “had pushed for the firing of Shokin, who U.S. and European officials believed was not sufficiently aggressive in pursuing corruption cases,” our colleagues write. Shokin has claimed he was pushed aside because of an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company whose board members included former vice president Joe Biden's son. (We should note our colleagues and scores of fact-checkers have found no credence to the claims that Biden's efforts were designed to curtail an investigation nor evidence of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.)

The Investigations

WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW ON IMPEACHMENT:

There's now another source who overheard Gordon Sondland's call with Trump: As we detailed here, the stakes are high for ambassador to the European Union as evidence emerged of a previously unknown call with Trump about getting Ukraine to pursue investigations. Now there's another State Department official saying they overheard the call, our colleagues John Wagner, Felicia Sonmez and Colby Itkowitz report.

Suriya Jayanti, a Foreign Service officer based at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, “overheard the phone call and also witnessed Sondland’s other interactions during his trip to Ukraine, where the call took place in a restaurant …

Jayanti was the embassy official tasked with accompanying Sondland throughout the day of the call.”

a Foreign Service officer based at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, “overheard the phone call and also witnessed Sondland’s other interactions during his trip to Ukraine, where the call took place in a restaurant … Jayanti was the embassy official tasked with accompanying Sondland throughout the day of the call.” Meanwhile, lawmakers will hear from the aide who told acting ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. about the Sondland call: David Holmes will testify behind closed doors this afternoon. One thing is certain: it will be challenging for Republicans to paint Holmes as a partisan as he was honored in 2014 with a State Department award for challenging President Obama's Afghanistan policy, our colleague Anne Gearan reports.

A White House official is set to break the blockade: Mark Sandy, a longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget, “is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday,” our colleague Erica Werner writes. If Sandy shows up for his closed-door deposition, he would be the first OMB official to cooperate with the inquiry.

Remember: OMB was the office that handled the hold on aid. Sandy could potentially fill in some key details on how that process unfolded.

The investigation into Rudy is wider than we thought: Giuliani “is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials,” Bloomberg's Chris Strohm and Jordan Fabian report. Other possible charges could relate to “bribing foreign officials or conspiracy.”

It's all about bribery now: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the Trump of “bribery” by seeking to use U.S. military aid as leverage to pressure the Ukrainian government to conduct investigations that could politically benefit the president, our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Toluse Olorunnipa report.

Why the change in wording: Pelosi's move away from the Latin quid pro quo came after House Democrats' campaign arm found the word “bribery” resonates more in battleground states, our colleague Rachael Bade wrote on Twitter. Bribery is also one of the specific phrases cited in the Constitution as an impeachable offense.

The GOP hones their attack: The lack of firsthand knowledge has become one of Republican's key rebuttals against the Democrats' case thus far, our colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report.

The Campaign

THE NOVEMBER DEBATE IS SET:

Here are the 10 Democratic presidential candidates that will be onstage next week: Biden, Harris, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg​​​​​​, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), financier and philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and businessman Andrew Yang.

There will be two fewer candidates than in October: Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro failed to make the stage for the first time. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke ended his campaign last month. There will be no new additions this time around.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro failed to make the stage for the first time. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke ended his campaign last month. There will be no new additions this time around. Tune in! The Nov. 20 debate, co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be held in Atlanta.

Meanwhile, Deval Patrick finds out just how hard it will be to break through: “He has no campaign cash, little campaign staff, low probability of qualifying for debates — and just 81 days to go, as of Thursday, before voting begins,” our colleagues Matt Viser and David Weigel report of the former Massachusetts governor's last-minute entry.

Timing is everything: “Patrick wants to appeal to black voters, but by a matter of days missed the deadline to make the ballots in Alabama and Arkansas, two states with large black populations,' our colleagues write. “He wants to win moderates and build a national coalition, but because he didn’t alert officials in Michigan of his candidacy earlier this week, he now faces the extraordinary task of gathering 11,000 signatures in the next month.”

Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters testifies to the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973. Millions of Americans tuned in to hearings that Variety called the “hottest daytime soap opera” in the country. (Associated Press/AP)

In the Media

'NOT EXACTLY HIGH DRAMA': “If you would like to watch grass grow, you would have loved the opening.” “Five hours of mostly colorless and snail's pace testimony.” What are we describing here?

If you were about fire off an angry tweet at yet another reporter for pointing out the lack of pizazz in current impeachment inquiry --- think again. Because 46 years ago, Washington Post reporter Jules Whitcover wrote those two descriptions and more about the first day of the Senate Watergate Commitee hearings.

The full Post front page:

In just a couple of months, things became much less boring: Jules didn't know then what we all know happened now. The world wouldn't learn until July 1973 that there was a taping system inside the White House.

Just over two months before Jules wrote that, lead White House counsel John Dean would call the Watergate case a ""cancer on the presidency"" during a conversation with President Nixon in the Oval Office as Dean talks about the foiled robbers potentially pejuring themselves. And in June 1972, when Nixon and White House chief of staff H.R. ""Bob” Haldeman plotted a cover-up less than a week after the break-in occured in what would become known as ""the smoking gun tape.""

He wasn't the only one who intitally wrote off the hearings: The networks ABC, CBS and NBC aired the hearings live each day but struck a deal to rotate coverage so they could still air their precious soap operas, as our colleague Gillian Brockell wrote earlier this week. But soon enough, the hearings became as popular, if not more, than their usual daytime dramas.

Key stat: ""By the time the 319 hours of Senate Watergate hearings had aired, nearly 85 percent of American households had watched at least some of them ...,"" our colleague writes.

This time could be very different though: As we saw unfold earlier this week, there are very clear echo chambers in how the allegations against Trump are being covered."

Obama did not name any candidates. But some Democrats associate the characteristics he described with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), staunch liberal candidates advocating sweeping change who are running near the top of the polls.

Beyond those two candidates, the contest has often been dominated by a discussion of ideas that were long seen as untenable, even in Democratic circles. Candidates have called for mandatory buybacks of certain firearms, decriminalizing border crossings and forgiving most or all student debt. In some cases, the proposals have come at a cost of tens of trillions of dollars, vast sums of money that would dwarf what Obama’s administration spent and require historically steep tax increases on wealthy Americans. While some voters and activists have cheered this trend, President Trump and his allies have been eager to highlight these themes.

However, Obama also warned the candidates against simply standing pat and campaigning on his accomplishments. Instead, he argued, they should try to “push past” them with new ideas. He pointed to his signature health-care law, which has been a focal point in the contest, as a prime example, calling it a “really good starter home.”

AD

AD

Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, has campaigned aggressively on expanding the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program, as has South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another top candidate.

That has put them at odds with Warren and Sanders, who favor implementing a new Medicare-for-all system that would insure everyone through the government.

Obama did not indicate a preference Friday.

The former president seemed to be urging a balance between striving for bold new ideas and being in touch with voters’ concerns. While it is the role of activists to push for dramatic change, Obama said, candidates should aim to win elections.

AD

“My point is that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party,” he said.

AD

The 44th president has been careful about commenting publicly about the contest. He has not spoken about it often, even as he has frequently met with and counseled the candidates in private over the past couple of years.

He said he has advised all of them to ask themselves the same basic questions: Why me? How will this impact my loved ones? And can I win?

AD

The last question is one that has increasingly given Democratic donors anxiety as they assess the field. This week, it grew with the addition of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, a staunch Obama ally who entered the race saying that neither the path trod by Biden nor Sanders and Warren “seizes the moment” in a way that insures a defeat for Trump. Meanwhile, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg also has taken steps toward running.

AD

The 11th-hour moves reflect a primary unsettled by the fears of many Democrats worried that Trump will seize a second term. Obama urged them to not to be fretful.

“For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,” he said, prompting laughter in the audience. He reminded those in attendance of his grueling 2008 battle with Hillary Clinton, which played out months before he won the presidency.

AD

“We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service,” Obama said. “And whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president.”

Even as he remains neutral in the primary, Obama is stepping deeper into the campaign. Next week, he will appear at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Silicon Valley.

AD

The president spoke Friday in what was billed as a “fireside chat” with Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and a rising star in the party. Obama praised Abrams and the work she is doing on voting rights with her recently launched organization.

As he concluded the roughly 45-minute discussion, Obama offered a final word of advice for the party’s White House hopefuls.

“We have the better argument,” Obama said. “We can’t be arrogant about it. We can’t take for granted that somehow people, just, you know, the scales will fall from their eyes at some point.”

This week, Elizabeth Warren attempted to cut the Medicare for All baby in half. Will it work? Political columnist Ed Kilgore joined me to discuss the merits of political incrementalism.

Ben: On Friday, Elizabeth Warren released a health-care proposal that seemed to acknowledge that she had put herself in a difficult position by previously adopting a Medicare for All–or-bust approach. In her new plan, her administration would quickly work to pass a Medicare public option — similar to but more generous than the ones being floated by the likes of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. Only in year three of her tenure would Warren turn to shifting the entire system to Medicare, doing away with private insurance. Does this strike you as a well-thought-out proposal? And do you think it’s smart politically?

Ed: Sort-of yes, and definitely yes. Not sure I’d treat this as some sort of flip-flop, though; I don’t remember her clearly saying she was adopting Bernie’s all-or-nothing timetable, though she has refused — and is still refusing — to make the whole enchilada a matter for mañana. Under this new plan, the final push would supposedly happen by her third year in office. But for those of us who, you know, live on planet Earth, the idea that Congress was going to enact a full M4A proposal in 2021 was always hallucinatory.

Ben: Is it much less hallucinatory to think that they’d do so in 2023?

Ed: Well, the idea is that Americans would finally get to see the contrast between the old and new systems, which would dispel their fears about losing private coverage. I don’t think it will happen that fast, if it happens at all. And there’s another problem with this timetable: She’s talking about the second, whole-enchilada bill passing by year three, which could mean right after a first midterm in which all but one president since FDR has lost strength in Congress.

Still, her plan would leave something pretty big and valuable in place. Not that the first bill will be a piece of cake, particularly if Democrats don’t win the Senate next year. Bernie’s plan implicitly says we’re stuck with the status quo (aside, I suppose, for whatever he can do administratively) until Medicare for All passes, though he has co-sponsored all sorts of incremental proposals in the past.

Ben: Pete Buttigieg’s campaign put out a statement attacking Warren’s proposal. An excerpt: “Senator Warren’s new health-care ‘plan’ is a transparently political attempt to paper over a very serious policy problem, which is that she wants to force 150 million people off their private insurance — whether they like it or not.” Buttigieg and others have gotten mileage out of contrasting themselves with Warren on health care, since most Americans prefer the idea of a public option over full-on Medicare for All right now. But will their jabs be less effective now that Warren has pivoted to the center a bit?

Ed: Well, Pete has shifted over time from the default position of many progressives treating M4A as the ultimate goal — which he once embraced — to a fairly hard-core defense of individual choice. Doesn’t sound like he thinks M4A in any form will ever be a good idea. But yes, to the extent Warren isn’t talking about abolishing private insurance until this sort of trial period of, well, “Medicare if you want it,” makes his attacks less effective. Pete, of course, is denying that Warren has “pivoted to the center.” Bernie Twitter sure is treating her as having moved into Satanic centrist territory, but I don’t believe Bernie himself has said anything just yet.

Ben: Haha. Does it matter much that it’s taken her a while to get to this point? Do you think voters who were hesitant to get onboard with her because of her previous health-care posture might give her a second look now?

Ed: It’s never been clear to me how much actual voters have been paying attention to this particular sub-debate. But in my mind it reinforces Warren’s claims to be hardheaded about political realities. She favors abolishing the filibuster — which is likely the only way a full M4A could ever be enacted — and is trying to design a first bill that can pass via budget reconciliation, which means 50 votes plus a veep. Bernie opposes killing the filibuster, and is still arguing that some sort of pixie-dust “political revolution” will make it happen.

Ben: Do you imagine that if the Democrats manage to win the Senate (which is an uphill battle) and the pivotal votes are then true moderates like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, that they’ll even give the green light to a public option in the face of what would be enormous pressure from the Democratic base? In other words, does even this incremental change have a good chance of happening?

Ed: It has a chance; not 100 percent how “good” that chance is. You could theoretically flip a Republican or two on an incremental bill, which would probably poll well. Most likely, a President Warren would have to compromise (like Obama did), and accept half of her half-a-loaf bill. That could, of course, be great news for many millions of Americans, and as she suggests, increase support for going the whole hog. If I’m not mistaken, Warren’s argument all along has been “you don’t get anything unless you demand exactly what you want.” That implies that once you’ve fought for your plan, you will eventually accept less if that’s all you can get. Nice to see her articulate a proposal that reflects that reality. This won’t, of course, keep Joe Biden from saying that she’s disrespecting Barack Obama’s legacy. I’m pretty sure the only reason Biden’s plan builds on Obamacare is so that he can say the word “Obama” a few more times a minute."

For almost a full year now, Barack Obama has gone out of his way to avoid commenting on 2020’s presidential primary. He doesn’t sit for interviews where he might be asked about it, he won’t mention candidates’ names, and even in private, he often changes the topic when friends try to get his take on the state of the race. Insofar as he has sought any role in the process, he preferred that it be as a detached advisor to contenders who request his big-picture guidance — he never wanted voters thinking he was trying to sway the contest. Lately, however, a very specific, very influential slice of the Democratic Party has been losing its mind, and Obama determined his role would have to change. So, on Friday evening, he climbed onto a stage in a basement ballroom in Washington’s Mandarin Oriental hotel and asked his party’s liberal elite to chill out a bit.

“We have a field of very accomplished, very serious, and passionate, and smart people who have a history of public service, and whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president,” he told the room of a few hundred of the party’s biggest donors and top strategists, gathered for a conference of the Democracy Alliance group.

The room was populated by the Warren-leaning version of the kind of people, Obama knew, that have recently been wearing out their loafers searching for a savior candidate, constantly fretting about electability, and seeding a national conversation that has borne the recent, late entries of Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick into the race. So maybe it was appropriate that it was here, after nearly three years of detachment from workaday politics, that Obama signaled for the first time a willingness to try and modulate his party’s debate — in this case to a less frantic tenor. “To those who get stressed about robust primaries,” he added, fully embodying this new slightly exasperated adult-in-the-room role, “I just have to remind you: I had a very robust primary.”

Yet Obama’s remarks were not only aimed at the donors and chatterers. He had a sterner-than-usual warning for the campaigns, too. While over the last year-plus he has been sparing in weighing in on individual primary flash points, here he cast himself as understanding but concerned emissary to what he perceives as political reality. “This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,” he said. “The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.” In Obama’s telling, Americans are conservative, not in ideology, but in temperament.

“Voters, including Democrats, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain left-leaning Twitter feeds, or the activist wing of our party,” he warned. “And that’s not a criticism to the activist wing — their job is to poke and prod and text and inspire and motivate. But the candidate’s job, whoever that ends up being, is to get elected.”

It’s a vision that clashes with some on his party’s left, most obviously including supporters of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And while he dismissed the debate between persuading voters and energizing base Democrats as “a false division,” he explained that he’d been thinking about how the candidates have been talking about him on the trail. “I think it is important for candidates to push past what I was able to achieve as president. I wouldn’t run the same campaign today, in this environment, as I ran in 2008, in part because we made enough progress since 2008, of which I am very proud, that it moved what’s possible. So I don’t want people to just revert to what’s safe, I want them to push out and try more, alright? So we got the Affordable Care Act. It was a really good starter home, as I say,” he said. “I don’t want people just standing pat, because we still have millions of people who are uninsured.”

“I don’t take it as a criticism when people say, ‘Hey, that’s great Obama did what he did, and now we want to do more.’ I hope so. That’s the whole point,” he said. “I think it is very important to all the candidates who are running, at every level, to pay some attention to where voters actually are, and how they think about their lives. And I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a bold enough proposal, and as soon as they hear a bold enough proposal that’s going to activate them. Because you know what? It turns out people are cautious, because they don’t have a margin for error.”

Onstage, Obama stuck to most of his personal Trump-era rules: He didn’t mention the president, or the news of the day — in this case the impeachment hearings. He didn’t mention any of the presidential candidates by name, either. But his remarks, delivered onstage next to Stacey Abrams, painted the clearest picture yet of Obama’s view of the primary, and of the direction of his party in the Trump era. And his timing sent as much of a message to the operatives in the room, and the candidates in the race, as his words.

Within the last week, Bloomberg let it be known he was closing in on a run (on which Obama got no heads-up), a decision largely made as a result of weakness the former New York City mayor perceives in Joe Biden’s campaign. And just a day before Obama addressed the donors, his friend Patrick surprisingly filed for the New Hampshire primary, a year after initially ruling it out. That move produced a chorus of speculative whispers in Washington about Obama’s possible role — some of the former president’s friends began suspecting this was in the cards late this summer after Patrick quietly told the Obama Foundation of his intention to leave its board. But despite their regular conversations, Patrick in fact only informed Obama of his final plan to run this week, according to Democrats familiar with the discussions.

Obama himself has said in other private talks that he thinks it’s rather late in the game for any new candidate to enter the contest. In private earlier this year he praised both Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke, but he also spoke more often about people who represent the future of the party — like, in his mind, Abrams and Andrew Gillum — than the presidential race. His political allies, meanwhile, remain scattered across the primary field, with former top aides peppering the senior ranks of all the serious campaigns.

And while perhaps Obama’s closest confidant, Valerie Jarrett, is a longtime Patrick booster, she told me on Friday that she told the former Massachusetts governor the same thing she said to all the candidates who asked: that he needed “first, a clear notion as to why you’re the best person for the job. And we talked about the challenges of a late entry, we talked about did he have the fire in his belly to do this, and did his family have the ability to make the sacrifices that were necessary? And, having been through this twice with the Obamas, is this something you are uniquely qualified to do?”

Then, like her old boss, Jarrett made sure to note, “The field is strong. We have an embarrassment of riches in the Democratic Party right now.”"

Her new pitch also seems designed to assuage voters worried that her earlier approach would force 150 million people off their private insurance. Her ability to sell this new plan — and refocus her campaign on her larger message of reform — will be a key test for her candidacy.

AD

The toll on her campaign is particularly apparent here in Iowa, where a new poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN released Saturday night showed Warren in a three-way tie for second place with former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), while South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg surged ahead of the pack. The poll shows Buttigieg with 25 percent support and Warren, Biden and Sanders all with about 15 percent support.

Before this most recent poll, an average of five statewide polls since October showed Warren at 20 percent support among likely Democratic caucus-goers, Biden at 18 percent, Buttigieg at 17 percent and Sanders at 16 percent, with other candidates averaging 4 percent or less.

AD

Warren has struggled to outline a plan for health care, saying earlier this month that she supports Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan but would pay for it differently.

AD

On Friday, she announced she will push Congress to pass legislation that allows all Americans to opt into the existing Medicare program in her first 100 days in office and take executive actions even sooner to lower the price of prescription drugs.

She wouldn’t push for full-blown Medicare-for-all until the third year of her term.

That has prompted Sanders to adjust, adding a line to his stump speech that contrasts Warren’s approach to his.

“Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all ­single-payer legislation,” he said Saturday in East Los Angeles.

AD

Polls consistently show that Iowa Democrats say health care is their top issue and also that many Democrats have conflicted views about Medicare-for-all.

A recent New York Times-Siena College poll found that over 7 in 10 likely caucusgoers support “a single-payer health care system, which would abolish private insurance and provide every American with a government health insurance.”

AD

But the same poll also found that more Democrats prefer a candidate who “promises to improve the existing health insurance system” rather than “replace the current health care system with Medicare-for-all.”

Several who attended Warren’s town hall Saturday were relieved by her new approach.

AD

“I like the shift,” said Elizabeth Texley, 43, of Cedar Rapids. Texley works with seniors and hasn’t yet decided who she will support in the upcoming caucuses.

“The goal of Medicare-for-all is great,” she said. “But I don’t think you’re going to be able to get everybody on board right now.”

Warren’s new proposal, Texley added, “does make it easier to support her.”

Kristina Burroughes, 28, said she wants Medicare-for-all to happen quickly but believes Warren’s adjustment is smart strategy. “It’s walking into it instead of diving,” Burroughes said as she waited in line for a photo with the candidate.

AD

In Iowa, Warren also tried to explain how her new plan differs from the proposal laid out by Buttigieg. Her plan, she argued, would get more people on government insurance for less money.

AD

“Mine is about actually giving people Medicare-for-all that is going to be full health-care coverage,” she said when asked about the differences. “I’m going to bring in as many people as we can right at the beginning.”

Sean Savett, a spokesman for Buttigieg, said that the Buttigieg plan preserves private insurance for those who want it. “Pete’s plan would also achieve universal health care coverage,” he said. “But unlike Senator Warren, he wouldn’t kick tens of millions of American families off their private health care plans because he trusts the American people to choose what’s right for them.”

But some voters didn’t detect a large difference between the two — aside from timing.

AD

AD

“She’s a week late for me,” said Conni Miller, 59 of Waverly, who came to Warren’s town hall even though she just committed to support Buttigieg largely because of his heath-care plan.

A key part of Warren’s gambit is to remain close enough to Sanders’s plan so that his voters would, at some point, support her. But among Sanders’s supporters gathered Saturday afternoon, there was deep skepticism.

NASHUA, N.H. — On Friday, after another day of impeachment hearings, Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado gave a few dozen voters his recap. Diplomats were fighting against “the destruction and the carnage of our institutions.” Trump strategist Roger Stone had been convicted of lying about connections to WikiLeaks.

“It felt like the rule of law was pushing back again,” Bennet said. “I think today was a great day.”

Within seconds, Bennet had moved on to talk about public education. Impeachment didn’t come up again over nearly an hour and a half of voter conversations. Bennet talked more about South Bend., Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his thin electoral record (“Mayor Pete won 8,000 votes”) than he did about the president.

Bennet was demonstrating one of the true surprises of this Democratic primary so far: the inability of President Trump to affect it. The president’s 2016 upset looms over the contest, with Democratic voters asking their candidates how they could win the Midwest again, or how they’d face Trump in a debate. But as 10 Democrats prepare for their fifth televised debate, the president's behavior — his nicknames, his insults, the latest impeachment revelation — has blurred into background noise.

That wasn't the expectation when the race began. In his first campaign, through a mix of strategy and brash accidents, Trump was able to turn week after week of Republican primary news into a story about him. In the run-up to this campaign, pundits ranked his greatest insults and speculated about how any lower-wattage candidate (i.e., any candidate) would be able to command a news cycle.

“The president has an ability to use social media to define his opponents and influence the primary debate in a way no sitting president before him has,” former White House spokesman Raj Shah told the Associated Press in February.

Instead, the president has been largely irrelevant in the day-to-day Democratic contest. Candidates are rarely asked to respond to his quotes. His “Pocahontas” insult, directed at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), still gets made, but doesn't make news. His attempt to ridicule Buttigieg as “Alfred E. Neumann” is so dimly remembered that the Indiana mayor, on a recent bus tour, was asked what he would do when Trump gave him a nickname. Trump's tweet calling Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota a “snow woman,” because she announced her candidacy during a blizzard, is so beloved by the candidate herself that she still mentions it in speeches.

Even major events in which the president played a big role have left the Democratic primary undisturbed. Sixteen years ago, the capture of Saddam Hussein rocked the Democratic primary, as President George W. Bush’s approval rating surged and as Howard Dean’s opponents refocused the race on his perceived “electability” problems. This year, the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi hardly caused a ripple, with Democrats quickly giving the credit to the military and the president’s own numbers staying flat.

Impeachment overwhelms all of it, and impeachment has been a sideshow for primary voters; at campaign events, they rarely ask about it. The irony, which Joe Biden has pointed out at his own events, is that the impeachment grew out of Trump's interest in the Democratic primary — specifically, his hope that Ukraine could provide dirt on Hunter Biden's work in the country and hurt his father, the former vice president.

“The more pressure he's under, the more erratic he becomes,” Biden told donors in Portland, Ore. on Saturday. “I mean, it's becoming truly erratic.”

But the Biden campaign's angle, that Trump was accidentally telling voters which Democrat he most feared, has not gotten through to primary voters. In the two months since The Washington Post first reported on a whistleblower's complaint about the pressure Trump put on Ukraine, Biden has dropped from 24.5 percent to 17.6 percent in an average of Iowa polls from RealClearPolitics, but polling has found that almost no Democrats think there is substance to Trump's attacks. Every Democratic rival has come to Biden's defense.

“It is not just about impeachment proceedings,” Klobuchar told reporters during her weekend swing through southern California. “They look at him in the White House and they say, we are not putting our country first. He's not protecting the interests of America first.”

It was typical of how Democrats usually talk about Trump: a catchall attack on how he's running things, followed as quickly as possible by the issue they want to talk about.

Impeachment has not dramatically altered the Democratic contest, but it has begun to expose weaknesses that didn't exist for Trump in 2016. One of them is obvious: He was able to command more attention with frequent campaign rallies than he does with this campaign's more intermittent “MAGA” events. Nothing Trump said in the most recent events, which he used to campaign for Republican gubernatorial candidates in Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi, lasted into the next day's news cycle. And Republicans in the first two of those three states lost, giving short-term confidence boosts to panicky Democrats.

One of those worries, when it came to impeachment, was that the president would rally his political base while no other topic broke through. The red-state gubernatorial losses cut against the first worry, while the second has come true in a way that largely hurts Trump. His feuds are more frequently with the impeachment witnesses and inquisitors than anyone running to take his job. That keeps him out of the Democrats' conversation and traps him in a more confusing one that primary voters aren't always following.

Some days, the president isn't targeted by Democrats at all. Only a handful of the ads Democrats have run in Iowa mention Trump at all; Buttigieg, who has risen quickly in Iowa, mentions him only by way of asking voters to picture America when he's gone. Over the past week, Warren ran just the second TV spot of her campaign, a targeted ad for CNBC to advertise her 2 percent tax on the super-rich.

“It is time for a wealth tax in America,” Warren says in the ad. “I’ve heard that there are some billionaires who don’t support this plan.”

Four billionaires, all critics of Warren, then appear on screen. Not among them: Trump, who says he is a billionaire but has stopped short of sharing tax records that could verify his net worth.

TURNOUT WATCH

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards made political history Saturday: He became the first Democrat to win a second term as governor in the state since 1975, and the first governor of either party to win after being forced into a runoff. And for the second time this month, the White House bet the president's political capital on a struggling Republican candidate for governor in a deep red state — and lost.

“You’ve got to give me a big win, okay?” Trump told voters at an 11th-hour rally for Eddie Rispone, the wealthy businessman who had forced the runoff election. Rispone fell 40,341 votes short, according to the state's initial count, out of more than 1.5 million votes cast. Outside of Mississippi, where Gov.-elect Tate Reeves was edging into the lead before Trump rallied for him, the president ended his year on a losing streak.

Republicans stuck by the president, as they'd done after this month's loss in Kentucky, and with identical messaging. “Eddie Rispone made up about a 22-point disadvantage over the last month because of President Trump's involvement,” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who had been urged to run against Edwards and declined. “Rispone was at about 27 [percent] in the primary, ended up at 49 [percent]. So, clearly, President Trump's involvement made a big difference in helping close that massive gap. And look, the governor's polling showed he was about 50 before President Trump first started to get involved. That forced a runoff.”

There was truth in this: Edwards had been edging toward a clean primary win in October, before sluggish early voting and a last-minute Trump rally forced the runoff. (In Louisiana, all party candidates compete in one primary, with the top two finishers facing off again if no one clears 50 percent.) But Republicans had hoped that forcing a runoff would doom Edwards, as Democrats struggled to rally for another election. Instead, he won.

How'd he do it? By getting more Democratic voters to the polls and converting suburbanites who were uncomfortable with Rispone's largely negative, Trump-focused campaign. Turnout increased from October to November, from 1,343,478 votes to 1,508,597 votes. In October, Republicans, led by Rispone and Rep. Ralph Abraham, clearly won more votes than Edwards and a fringe Democratic candidate: 696,399 for the GOP to just 636,993 for the other guys.

On Saturday, Rispone won 734,128 votes, which would have been a rout in October. But Edwards surged, winning 148,469 more votes than he had in the first round. In Orleans Parish, the biggest single source of Democratic votes, he won 86,281 votes in October and 114,812 votes in November. In the West and East Baton Rouge parishes, his vote total grew from 89,898 to 110,523. The new votes from the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metro areas more than made up Edwards's statewide win margin.

Edwards built a sort of “blue wall” that Rispone could not overcome, especially because of the Republican's weakness in the northeast Louisiana parishes where Trump had campaigned. That part of the state, which Abraham represents in Congress, had decisively backed him in October. It never truly embraced Rispone. While Trump had carried the region by 29.4 points, Rispone carried it by just 9.2 points.

Rispone did best in the state's 3rd Congressional District, across the old Cajun region that had voted reliably Democratic for decades until Barack Obama's presidency. He lost, among other reasons, because as that pattern broke, the state voted a bit more like the rest of the country: rural white voters for the GOP, and suburbanites for the Democrats. In a final irony, forcing the runoff might have ended up hurting the president's party, as higher turnout helped Democrats flip the 105th state legislative district, which stretches from the New Orleans suburbs to the Gulf of Mexico. That will prevent Republicans from holding a legislative supermajority in 2020 or 2021, giving Edwards the Democrats' first chance since 2001 to shape the state's congressional map.

POLL WATCH

Iowa caucuses (Selzer & Co, 500 likely caucusgoers)

Pete Buttigieg — 25% ( 16)

Elizabeth Warren — 16% (-6)

Joe Biden — 15% (-5)

Bernie Sanders — 15% ( 4)

Cory Booker — 3% ( 0)

The gold standard of Iowa polls has uncommon power to change the way people look at this race. Before this poll, it had looked as though Buttigieg was breaking through, with giant crowds, strong organizing and a rebuffed image as the young liberal who wants to unify the country. After this poll, that's all undeniable: Buttigieg has figured out exactly what exhausted Iowa Democrats are craving. They want freshness, they want center-left politics, and they are less worried about experience than whether a candidate can perform.

Buttigieg is now the best-liked Democrat in the field, with Warren right behind, but just as telling is the trend since December 2018. Joe Biden is viewed less favorably than he was then by 35 points; Sanders, by 26 points. Warren, who was generally known at that time but has increased to near-universal name recognition, has seen her favorables head up by a net of 3 points. Buttigieg, who was almost totally unknown, has seen his favorable rating spike by 49 points.

Nevada caucuses (Fox News, 1,506 voters)

Buttigieg's rise, for now, is being welcomed by the Sanders campaign, and it's not being feared by the Biden campaign. This is why: The Indiana mayor has still not become competitive with nonwhite voters, whose input is decisive once the campaign leaves New Hampshire. Here, as in most polls of Nevada and South Carolina, there's a real battle for the white vote between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren; he gets 23 percent, she gets 21 percent.

Buttigieg is about tied with Sanders among white voters, but the senator from Vermont, as in many of the states where he campaigned extensively four years ago, is strong with Latinos: He gets 31 percent of those voters, to just 1 percent for Buttigieg. The backup dream scenario for the Sanders campaign (i.e., the dream that doesn't start with him winning Iowa) is one where Buttigieg beats the field in the first, heavily white states, then splits college-educated whites with Biden as Sanders consolidates young voters and competes strongly for nonwhite voters.

Whatever happens with Elizabeth Warren and her newly detailed Medicare-for-all transition plan, we know what happened during its genesis: She fell out of the Democrats' sweet spot. Until October, Warren was generally viewed by primary voters as a markedly more pragmatic candidate than Sanders. Her rhetoric solidified that: He called for political revolution and an end to billionaires, while she had a 2-cent wealth tax and defined herself as a capitalist. The attack on Medicare-for-all, led by the insurance industry but echoed by some Democratic candidates, hurt Sanders more than Warren in early states.

After a month of plans that make Warren's design clear — a massive expansion of Medicare at the start of her presidency, followed by a phaseout of private insurance — she is viewed as more liberal than before.

2020

Elizabeth Warren. She introduced her own transition plan for Medicare-for-all, which differs from the one offered by Bernie Sanders: It would use the budget reconciliation process to start expanding Medicare and automatically enrolling the uninsured in the system. “Unlike public option plans,' Warren wrote, “the benefits of the true Medicare for All option will match those in the Medicare for All Act. This includes truly comprehensive coverage for primary and preventive services, pediatric care, emergency services and transportation, vision, dental, audio, long-term care, mental health and substance use, and physical therapy.”

Mike Bloomberg. He hasn't launched his campaign yet, if he follows through on it at all. But he used a Sunday morning address to Brooklyn's Christian Cultural Center to apologize for the “stop and frisk” police policy that he defended as mayor. “I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong,” he said. “Far too many innocent people were being stopped. And the overwhelming majority of them were black and Latino. That may have included, I’m sorry to say, some of you here today, or perhaps your children or grandchildren, or your neighbors or relatives.”

Bernie Sanders. He won the support of the 34,000-member United Teachers Los Angeles union, something that was possible in this cycle because the American Federation of Teachers gave some more wiggle room for locals to announce their own endorsements. Sanders also stood out for criticizing the United States' speedy recognition of Bolivia's new government, which took power after the country's military forced out President Evo Morales.

“At the end of the day, it was the military who intervened in that process and asked him to leave,” Sanders told Univision's Jorge Ramos at a Saturday forum in Los Angeles. “In my view, that’s a coup.”

Kamala Harris. She scored her first labor union endorsement: the United Farm Workers, whose co-founder Dolores Huerta had endorsed her campaign earlier this year.

Joe Biden. His campaign cited the newest polling, which finds him trailing in Iowa, in an all-hands-on-deck email to donors. “Yesterday, we got a new poll in Iowa and honestly it's not what we want to see,” it read. “Right now we are tied for 3rd in Iowa. Losing Iowa doesn't mean we can't win, but it makes winning the primary harder and more expensive.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Whatever else happens to their presidential dreams, Deval Patrick and Mike Bloomberg have already made history. They are declaring, or on the verge of declaring, later than any primary candidate has in this century. Not since December 1991, when Pat Buchanan launched his quixotic conservative challenge to George H.W. Bush, has any contender announced this close to the first primaries. Not since the 1980s has a Democrat entered the primaries without a plan to qualify in every state; Patrick has forfeited the Alabama and Arkansas primaries, while Bloomberg, if he runs, is going to skip the first four states.

What's the record of candidacies like this? Not good.

First, understand that the ultramodern Democratic primary, which assigns delegates to the winners of primaries and caucuses, dates back to only 1984. Before that, some states had conventions where nominees won endorsements and delegates; before that, the party combined a few primaries with more opaque contests for the support of party leaders. (Think of a “smoke-filled room.”)

Winning the modern Democratic nomination means organizing in each state, which makes buzzer-beating campaigns even harder. Patrick's campaign has been compared to the 2003 effort that drafted Wesley Clark into the Democratic primary; Clark announced a full month earlier, relative to the first contests, than Patrick. (In 2004, 2008 and 2012, the first states voted in January, not February.) Clark, like Fred Thompson four years later, announced in September of the year before voting began; Rick Perry, whose 2012 Republican bid was undone by his unpreparedness, announced in August 2011. The tail end of summer is usually the make-or-break point for serious candidacies, not November.

Perry, Thompson and Clark had something else in common: They lost. It's always risky to draw a historical trend from the small sample size of contested presidential primaries. Let's do it anyway: Since 1984, the winner of the Democratic primary has announced his or her candidacy at least four months before the first contests. Just two candidates who declared later than that won any primaries: Jesse Jackson, whose 1984 campaign was victorious in the District of Columbia, Louisiana and Mississippi, and Clark, whose 2004 campaign carried Oklahoma.

WHAT I'M WATCHING

The fraying “super PAC” truce. One month ago, the Democratic candidates for president agreed on one thing: They would not endorse “super PACs.” There would be no outside source of endless money running ads for or against them in key states.

Joe Biden was the first Democrat to break with that pledge, and other candidates are getting more PAC-curious, especially as Mike Bloomberg's candidacy looms. In his first news conference as a candidate, on Friday, Deval Patrick said that he would not rule out a super PAC, as he'd had such a late start already, and needed to compete with candidates who'd already introduced themselves.

“I wish it weren't so,” Patrick said. “I wish the campaigns weren't as expensive.” He repeated that rationale on Sunday's “Meet the Press,” telling host Chuck Todd that any super PAC should disclose its donors. “I think we need to do some catch-up,” he explained.

Separately, in a short interview with The Post, Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado said that he would not tell a super PAC to back down if it was created to help his candidacy.

“I'm all for it,” Bennet said. “I wouldn't dissuade them.”

Patrick, Bennet and Biden remain outnumbered: Most of the Democratic field has refused to give its blessing to a super PAC. On Friday, as he filed for the New Hampshire primary, Cory Booker reiterated that he did not want support from a super PAC; at the same time, Elizabeth Warren's campaign denounced an effort by a supportive donor to buy pro-Warren ads in Iowa.

13. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii): Ever since Hillary Clinton speculated that Gabbard would be recruited to run a third-party campaign, Gabbard has been … sounding a lot like a third-party candidate. She called Clinton the “personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long” and announced she wouldn’t seek reelection to her House seat, in the face of a tough primary. But she still says she won’t run third-party. Expect her to be more of a focal point at Wednesday’s Washington Post/NBC News debate, but she’s selling something with limited appeal for this electorate. (Previous ranking: 12)

12. Businessman Tom Steyer: Money can’t buy you happiness, but it can rent you a place on the debate stage. Steyer spent a whopping $47 million of his own funds in the third quarter and got enough early-state polls to qualify for the last debate and this one. He still hasn’t done much with the platform, though. (Previous ranking: 11)

Tier 3

10. Former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro: Unlike the three candidates above, Castro didn’t qualify for Wednesday’s debate. In fact, his campaign is in pretty dire straits, both financially and polling-wise. I still see him as a more likely nominee than the previous three, in that he’s shown the kind of things you’d expect from someone who could plausibly take advantage of a topsy-turvy race. And he’s still a legitimate vice presidential prospect. (Previous ranking: 8)

9. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg: The first new entry on this list, I’ve got him a tier below Patrick because I just have a difficult time seeing why Democrats would go for Bloomberg. He aligns with them on key issues like guns and climate, but he’s a billionaire with some baggage, and a poll showed he’s already the most unpopular candidate — before he even gets in. I’m also somewhat skeptical he’ll eventually run; remember that he was filing for primaries because he had to if he ever wanted to run, not because he’s definitely in. His decision not to file for the early states is also quite the head-scratcher, given he had time to do so. (Previous ranking: N/A)

AD

Tier 2

8. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick: Patrick isn’t a billionaire, but he does come to this primary from the party’s more corporate wing. Heck, he’s been working at the Mitt Romney-founded Bain Capital since 2015. But he’s a gifted messenger and someone plenty of high-profile Democrats have apparently wanted to run for a long time, including possibly Barack Obama. He should have a seat at the table, even as his late start is obviously not great. (Previous ranking: N/A)

7. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.): Booker hadn’t gotten much traction to this point, but Bloomberg and Patrick probably make his path even more difficult. They’re both viable options for more business-friendly Democrats, they’re both from the Northeast like Booker, and Patrick could be a candidate to pick off the black voters who haven’t really gravitated to Booker. It’s still too early to call Booker a bust, though. (Previous ranking: 6)

6. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.): A new automated Public Policy Polling survey shows her climbing to 9 percent in Iowa. That’s her highest to date, but it’s hardly the first to suggest she’s climbing in that state. Despite this momentum, she declared she would root for her home-state Gophers against the University of Iowa on Saturday. This Minnesota alumna admires those principles (even if they lost).

Tier 1

4. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Speaking of Iowa, Buttigieg moves into the top tier thanks to the authoritative Des Moines Register poll showing him opening up a significant lead there. He’s at 25 percent, with Elizabeth Warren in second at 16 percent and Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden at 15 percent. It’s no fluke; he’s been virtually tied for the lead there in the previous four polls, too (including the PPP poll). He’s not polling like a top-tier candidate nationally or in other early states, notably, but he’s clearly an attractive candidate to Iowa Democrats, and if he wins there … ? (Previous ranking: 5)

AD

AD

3. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): While he waned a little in Iowa early on, the suddenly crowded pack of leaders there seems jumbled enough that he may not need to get to 30 percent to win. For someone with a very devoted base, that makes him a clear player. And if he wins Iowa, he’s got a big leg up in New Hampshire. (Previous ranking: 3)

2. Former vice president Joe Biden: You have to think Patrick and Bloomberg are doing this at least in part because they don’t see Biden effectively carrying the banner of the more moderate wing of the Democratic Party against Sanders and Warren. It’s not like Biden has really fallen in the polls, but there is clearly concern about his long-term viability if these candidates see an opening. (Previous ranking: 2)

1. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.): One of the undersold dynamics of the 2020 race is all the big business types attacking her — and probably helping her in the process, the latest being Lloyd Blankfein. Well, she’s suddenly seizing on it, with her campaign selling a mug that says “billionaire tears” on the side. Expect this to be a theme. (Previous ranking: 1)

Trump faces impeachment because of well-substantiated charges that the “favor” he asked of Ukraine’s president was to announce an investigation that would undermine one of those candidates, former vice president Joe Biden, who happens to be polling best in states most likely to swing the 2020 outcome.

Although Trump’s specific effort ultimately failed, he has already succeeded in his larger mission. Most informed voters now know that Biden’s son Hunter worked for a company that did business in Ukraine while Joe Biden was vice president. It is a classic Trumpian operation: Sow doubts about an opponent, dirty her or him up, and let the media — yes, that “corrupt liberal media” that Trump and his apologists love to denounce — do the rest.

The collateral human damage of Trump’s immorality was brought home during Friday’s testimony from Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She resisted Trump’s use of American power on behalf of his own political interests and was thus removed by the president, at the instigation of corrupt elements in Ukraine.

The 33-year State Department veteran not only lost her post, but now faces a separate smear campaign. Trump’s tweets denigrating her public service while she testified led committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to declare that “some of us here take witness intimidation very, very ­seriously.”

The shameful lack of decency from the man in the Oval Office would have been shocking from any other president, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that the tweet reflected how unsuited Trump is for the presidency altogether. “I think part of it is his own insecurity as an impostor,” she said. “I think he knows full well that he’s in that office way over his head.”

Now, move to the other screen. Ten Democratic presidential candidates will debate on Wednesday in Atlanta. Absent will be former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who joined the race last week, and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is flirting with entering. The odds against such latecomers are overwhelming. That they believe they have any chance at all reflects more than their ambition. They’re also spurred on by the Trump-induced chaos and the widespread sense that the nomination contest is in a state of flux.

Biden has been hurt by his own missteps and Trump’s efforts to besmirch him. But he still leads in national polls, and hangs on to his support among older voters, white and African American alike. He can also claim the risks the president has taken to undermine him as evidence of his electoral strength. Weekend polls showed South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging in Iowa, which will vote first in February. He can count on being the target of attacks from just about everyone else this week.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has had the best year of anyone, but her embrace of Medicare-for-all has led to the first serious challenges to her seemingly inexorable rise.

She sent a strong signal on Friday that she understood the water her campaign was taking on. By issuing a plan calling for a gradual transition to a new health-care system and emphasizing that she would begin her term by strengthening Obamacare with a public option and regulatory actions, she moved herself closer to Biden and Buttigieg on the issue. This is a much safer position for a general election campaign, but it will be seen as a retreat by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Medicare-for-all’s original champion, who has enjoyed a resurgence in the polls in recent weeks.

At one level, it’s a sign of the vitality of American politics that even as impeachment moves forward, at least one party is grappling with problems being left untended in the mayhem Trump has let loose.

AD

AD

Nonetheless, these candidates must remember the immediate priority of what’s happening on Screen One. The principal task between now and February is to help the country come to judgment about the president’s abuse of power and the dangers he poses to our republic.

Plans for health care and the economy matter enormously for the future, as Warren’s midcourse corrections demonstrate. But right now is the best opportunity these Democrats will have to show who is best positioned to prosecute the moral case against Donald Trump.

Obama did not name any candidates. But some Democrats associate the characteristics he described with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), staunch liberal candidates advocating sweeping change who are running near the top of the polls.

Beyond those two candidates, the contest has often been dominated by a discussion of ideas that were long seen as untenable, even in Democratic circles. Candidates have called for mandatory buybacks of certain firearms, decriminalizing border crossings and forgiving most or all student debt. In some cases, the proposals have come at a cost of tens of trillions of dollars, vast sums of money that would dwarf what Obama’s administration spent and require historically steep tax increases on wealthy Americans. While some voters and activists have cheered this trend, President Trump and his allies have been eager to highlight these themes.

However, Obama also warned the candidates against simply standing pat and campaigning on his accomplishments. Instead, he argued, they should try to “push past” them with new ideas. He pointed to his signature health-care law, which has been a focal point in the contest, as a prime example, calling it a “really good starter home.”

Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, has campaigned aggressively on expanding the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program, as has South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another top candidate.

That has put them at odds with Warren and Sanders, who favor implementing a new Medicare-for-all system that would insure everyone through the government.

Obama did not indicate a preference Friday.

The former president seemed to be urging a balance between striving for bold new ideas and being in touch with voters’ concerns. While it is the role of activists to push for dramatic change, Obama said, candidates should aim to win elections.

AD

“My point is that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party,” he said.

AD

The 44th president has been careful about commenting publicly about the contest. He has not spoken about it often, even as he has frequently met with and counseled the candidates in private over the past couple of years.

He said he has advised all of them to ask themselves the same basic questions: Why me? How will this impact my loved ones? And can I win?

AD

The last question is one that has increasingly given Democratic donors anxiety as they assess the field. This week, it grew with the addition of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, a staunch Obama ally who entered the race saying that neither the path trod by Biden nor Sanders and Warren “seizes the moment” in a way that insures a defeat for Trump. Meanwhile, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg also has taken steps toward running.

AD

The 11th-hour moves reflect a primary unsettled by the fears of many Democrats worried that Trump will seize a second term. Obama urged them to not to be fretful.

“For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,” he said, prompting laughter in the audience. He reminded those in attendance of his grueling 2008 battle with Hillary Clinton, which played out months before he won the presidency.

AD

“We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service,” Obama said. “And whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president.”

Even as he remains neutral in the primary, Obama is stepping deeper into the campaign. Next week, he will appear at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Silicon Valley.

AD

The president spoke Friday in what was billed as a “fireside chat” with Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and a rising star in the party. Obama praised Abrams and the work she is doing on voting rights with her recently launched organization.

As he concluded the roughly 45-minute discussion, Obama offered a final word of advice for the party’s White House hopefuls.

“We have the better argument,” Obama said. “We can’t be arrogant about it. We can’t take for granted that somehow people, just, you know, the scales will fall from their eyes at some point.”

The speech served as one of the clearest indicators yet that the billionaire businessman might soon join the crowded Democratic primary. Bloomberg has filed paperwork to run in Alabama and Arkansas and has mapped out a strategy that would largely bypass the four earliest nominating states.

AD

Bloomberg’s attempt to confront one of his biggest potential liabilities reflects the ongoing shift in the Democratic Party on issues of race, criminal justice and police violence. Voters and activists are increasingly demanding their leaders take firmer stances against discrimination by law enforcement and reject tough-on-crime policies that were more widely accepted decades ago.

This dynamic poses a challenge to older white candidates, such as former vice president Joe Biden, and it could create tough choices for many voters of color in the coming months. Biden and Bloomberg have complicated records on racial issues, with accomplishments lauded in minority communities and decisions panned in those same areas.

AD

“I got something important wrong,” said Bloomberg, who grew visibly emotional at times during his speech. “I got something important really wrong.”

AD

Biden performs well among black voters, polls show. Bloomberg is hoping to make his own inroads in coming months.

But it’s far from clear whether his apology, delivered in a highly controlled setting, will work. He gave his speech at the Christian Cultural Center, a familiar venue he had been to 17 times before, according to an aide. Bloomberg received a subdued round of applause at the end of the speech.

“Many people will see it as mixed,” said NAACP chief executive and President Derrick Johnson, speaking about Bloomberg’s record. Stop-and-frisk was “extremely problematic,” Johnson said, but, “at the exact same time, he’s been a strong supporter of gun reform and against gun violence. And that’s a positive thing.”

AD

The Police Benevolent Association, New York’s largest police union, dismissed the apology as “too little, too late.” Patrick J. Lynch, the group’s president, said in a statement that officers had warned “that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities.”

AD

Bloomberg’s potential candidacy and the way his record is perceived are surprise variables in a fluid Democratic race that has taken many twists and turns. Pete Buttigieg, a once-little-known mayor from South Bend, Ind., has surged to the lead in a new Iowa poll. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick just threw his hat into the ring. Biden has held his lead in many national polls. And Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have posted huge fundraising numbers that have boosted their chances.

From the start of 2002 until the end of 2013, Bloomberg served as mayor of the country’s most populous city, first as a Republican and later as an independent. During much of his tenure, the New York Police Department stepped up its use of stop-and-frisk. The most dramatic increases occurred during his first five years, according to department data analyzed by the New York Civil Liberties Union.

AD

Stop-and-frisk refers to the practice of police officers stopping, questioning and searching people they suspect may have committed crimes or are about to do so. The NYCLU analysis found that the stops disproportionately targeted young black and Latino men and that the vast majority did not result in arrests or summonses — a point Bloomberg acknowledged Sunday.

AD

“Far too many innocent people were being stopped,” he said. “And the overwhelming majority of them were black and Latino. That may have included, I’m sorry to say, some of you here today.”

“Perhaps yourself or your children or grandchildren, or your neighbors or your relatives,” he added.

AD

Bloomberg said repeatedly during his remarks that his focus was on saving lives. The NYCLU analysis, however, found that searches yielded weapons a small percentage of the time. A Washington Post analysis of data from the Brennan Center for Justice and the FBI found no correlation between stop-and-frisk and the reduction of violent crime in New York City.

In 2013, a federal judge ruled that the stop-and-frisk law was unconstitutional and said the city had engaged in indirect racial profiling. Bloomberg sought Sunday to underscore his efforts to reduce the number of stops before that time.

AD

During a sometimes pointed question-and-answer session at the Naval Academy in January, Bloomberg defended his record on stop-and-frisk, saying police “certainly” did not stop people based on their race.

AD

Bloomberg concluded his Sunday speech without making any firm commitments to running for president. “I don’t know what the future holds for me,” he said.

In the audience, Laruth Williams, 67, said Bloomberg’s apology was “surprising” and “sincere.” Lorna Lewis, 74, also said she felt he was sincere, but added, “I think he has to do a little bit more.”

Some associates and observers predict he will soon enter the race. Although his record is controversial, he is showing some signs of progress with African American leaders.

The Rev. Al Sharpton said he recently attended an Alabama state Baptist convention and found black support for Bloomberg. “Two or three ministers asked me about Bloomberg fairly positively,” he said. Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. met with Bloomberg and said he left a “great first impression.”

AD

AD

Still, he faces an imposing challenger in Biden, who has formed close ties with many African American leaders and has been outpacing his rivals among black voters in the polls.

Yet Biden has also faced scrutiny over his record on race, including his spearheading of a 1994 crime law that led to increased incarceration levels as well as his controversial comments about a segregationist senator and busing.

Asked if he could support a Bloomberg presidential bid, Sharpton said he was still undecided but that he would ultimately have to consider Bloomberg’s record on stop-and-frisk against the records of “candidates that supported the crime bill that was devastating,” a reference to votes by Biden and Sanders for the 1994 law.

AD

Bloomberg’s aggressive and well-funded initiative to tighten gun laws and elect members of Congress committed to placing new regulations on firearms could help boost his appeal to African American leaders and voters.

That doesn’t mean they will soon forget stop-and-frisk.

“Like any candidate offering themselves up for public office, we’re always going to have good and bad,” Johnson said.

She issued a series of plans covering things such as child care and college costs and housing, ambitious and costly initiatives that she said would pay for with a new wealth tax on people with fortunes of $50 million or more. She promises to take on the big banks and drug companies and the tech giants. She supports political reforms that would diminish the power of special interests and big money in politics.

One piece was always missing in those early days. That was a health-care plan. Warren has sought to bring rigor to her policy proposals, and as every candidate and president has learned, health care is the knottiest, most complex and seemingly insoluble of the big issues. She seemed in no rush to put her own stamp on a plan until she was ready.

Like all the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, she shared the goal of assuring universal and affordable health-care coverage to all Americans. She was for Medicare-for-all rhetorically but hesitated to offer her own distinctive plan, perhaps knowing that this could be a 10-year project and one that might be done in small steps or in a big bang.

AD

AD

During a CNN town hall meeting in March, she said, “When we talk about Medicare-for-all, there are a lot of different pathways. What we’re all looking for is the lowest-cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.”

She took a fateful step away from that position during the first Democratic debate in June in Miami. Asked by NBC News’s Lester Holt who would support eliminating private insurance, she raised her hand. Moments later, she cast her lot with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has long been the most vocal advocate of replacing the current employer-based insurance system with a single-payer government-managed system. “I’m with Bernie on Medicare-for-all,” she said that night.

That helped to widen a fault line in the Democratic field between those like Warren and Sanders, who were calling for the elimination of private insurance, and those like former vice president Joe Biden and others, who proposed building on the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option but not jettisoning the current structure.

AD

AD

Warren further isolated herself by declining to explain how she would pay for Medicare-for-all — in contrast with Sanders. The senator readily acknowledged that, under his proposal, middle-class families would pay higher taxes. But he argued that the shift to a single-payer system would result in lower overall costs to those families for their health-care coverage and therefore was well worth it.

Warren, under repeated questioning and criticism from her rivals, would not answer directly. She tried to deflect by saying that she would not sign a plan that would mean higher health-care costs for middle-class Americans. To her critics and even some of her supporters, it was an evasive and unsatisfying answer, particularly coming from someone who had detailed answers to questions about her other proposals.

Then a few weeks ago, just before a big Iowa Democratic Party fundraising dinner that drew all the candidates, Warren answered her critics by issuing a financing plan for Medicare-for-all. She had experts who vouched for the soundness of the financing plan, but other experts picked it apart as unrealistic, based on some overly rosy assumptions. To the broader audience of Democrats, it didn’t pass muster.

AD

AD

For those with doubts about her viability as a general election candidate, the proposal only added to their worries. Politically it fell far short of what she might have hoped. It opened her up to fresh charges that she was advocating a health-care plan that lacks majority support in the country and didn’t have a sound plan to pay for it.

Many in her party worried that if she became the nominee, she would be handing President Trump’s reelection campaign ammunition on an issue — health care — that long has been more favorable to Democrats

Conversations with Democrats over the past two weeks have underscored the degree to which the whole issue was becoming a potential obstacle to a campaign that otherwise has been doing many things right. “It froze a lot of people,” a still-uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat said last weekend.

AD

AD

Warren has prided herself on being a fighter for the causes she believes in, and she and her campaign team have aggressively pushed her health-care plan, even at the doorstep with voters. One Democrat said that a Warren field organizer knocked on his door recently and during the conversation initiated a defense of her plan and explained why she could win a general election with that position.

All of which makes what Warren did on Friday potentially significant. In short, she said that in her first 100 days she would try to enact legislation that would allow, but not require, Americans to purchase a government health-care plan — in other words, a public option akin but not identical to those proposed by Biden; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); and others.

Warren also said that she would wait until the third year of her presidency to begin to enact a Medicare-for-all plan, a more gradual approach than she had seemingly described in the past and one would allow her to try to build public support before plunging into something as daunting as this would be.

AD

AD

Warren will try to argue that the changes she proposes during the transition period are more ambitious than those of her rivals, in keeping with her pledge to be the candidate of big structural change. But she already has come under criticism for a change in positions and will face many more in the weeks ahead as she tries to explain the evolution of her thinking.

What Warren did on Friday could help to ease the fears of Democrats that she would be a vulnerable general-election candidate advocating positions that are politically unpalatable. But she is a long way from becoming the nominee. Medicare-for-all proved to be a problem for her and, while she may be on slightly safer ground today than a week ago, she hasn’t fully solved the problem.

The photo mix-up is just the latest controversy to erupt around the Douglass Plan since it was rolled out in July as part of Buttigieg’s effort to make inroads with black voters. While recent polling has shown Buttigieg surging toward the front of the crowded Democratic presidential field in Iowa, the candidate has struggled to draw support from African Americans.

Some critics pointed to the photo as further proof of that disconnect.

By late Sunday, Buttigieg’s campaign confirmed to The Washington Post that the photo of the Kenyan woman was no longer on the page promoting the Douglass Plan, noting that it had been taken down in September during an update. A contracting firm had chosen the stock image while building the site without knowing that it was taken in Africa, according to the campaign.

AD

The photo was one of several featuring people of color that ran on the page touting the Douglass Plan. Named after abolitionist and activist Frederick Douglass, the plan aims to “dismantle racist structures and systems” in the United States by proposing changes to the country’s health, education and criminal justice systems, The Post reported in July.

AD

Last month, the campaign announced that more than 400 people in South Carolina, where the latest Monmouth Poll had Buttigieg at 1 percent among black voters, endorsed the plan. The news was promoted in an Oct. 24 op-ed signed by the plan’s supporters and three black South Carolina Democrats: Columbia City Council member Tameika Isaac Devine, state Rep. Ivory Thigpen, and the state party’s Black Caucus chair, Johnnie Cordero.

“There is one presidential candidate who has proven to have intentional policies designed to make a difference in the Black experience, and that’s Pete Buttigieg,” according to the op-ed, which ran in HBCU Times, a publication dedicated to news about historically black colleges and universities. “We are over 400 South Carolinians, including business owners, pastors, community leaders, and students. Together, we endorse his Douglass Plan for Black America, the most comprehensive roadmap for tackling systemic racism offered by a 2020 presidential candidate.”

AD

But questions soon emerged about the nature of support Buttigieg had found for the plan. The Washington Post reported on Nov. 11 that “Buttigieg persuaded hundreds of prominent black South Carolinians to sign onto the plan even if they are not supporting his candidacy.”

AD

“His campaign then trumpeted these signatures in a way that forced figures such as Devine, for one, to clarify that she was not endorsing Buttigieg,” The Post’s Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Amy B Wang wrote.

On Friday, Devine told the Intercept that the campaign had been “intentionally vague” about the way it presented her endorsement, which led some to believe she was backing Buttigieg as a candidate and not just the Douglass Plan. The council member reiterated her support for the plan in a tweet over the weekend.

Cordero and Thigpen, however, told the Intercept they did not expect their names to appear on the op-ed.

“I never endorsed that plan,” Cordero said. “I don’t know how my name got on there.”

Thigpen, who has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president, said the way Buttigieg’s campaign rolled out its October announcement “was not an accurate representation of where I stand.”

AD

Cordero’s name was taken off the op-ed before the Intercept’s story published, according to Buttigieg’s campaign. Thigpen remains as one of the named supporters.

People who expressed interest in backing the plan had the option to opt out of having their names attached to the op-ed if they responded in time to an email sent by the campaign, the Intercept reported. After reviewing the names, the publication found that at least 42 percent of the list was made up of white voters.

AD

In a statement to The Post on Sunday, a spokesman for the campaign said, “We’ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication.” The statement also pushed back against allegations that the campaign “gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete.”

AD

“We asked a number of Black South Carolinians, as well as South Carolinians from many backgrounds, to support the Douglass Plan, and we are proud and grateful that hundreds agreed to do so,” the statement said, noting that people were given multiple chances to review the op-ed and those who asked had their names taken off.

This weekend, conversation shifted to the photo, which Grim pointed out Friday had been taken in Kenya. In a Sunday tweet, he explained the Kenyan woman reached out to him “very confused” about why her picture was suddenly linked to an American presidential candidate. Grim added that the woman did agree to be photographed, but “didn’t intend to pose for a stock photo.”

By early Monday, Grim’s tweet had garnered hundreds of responses.

One person accused Buttigieg’s campaign of “pure laziness.”

“Sounds like a man with his finger on the pulse of the black community,” another tweeted.

When South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg invested a big chunk of his impressive 2017 fundraising haul in building a strong organization (more than 100 staffers and 20 field offices, according to CNN) in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, he was gambling on an early breakthrough. It could be paying off: Multiple polls are showing him running first in Iowa.

If there was any doubt Mayor Pete’s having a moment there, it was dispelled this weekend by the latest gold-standard Iowa Poll from Ann Selzer for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom. Selzer shows Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely caucusgoers, with a healthy lead over Elizabeth Warren at 16 percent and both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders at 15 percent. Mayor Pete was only at 9 percent in Selzer’s last poll in September. And his internals look good: His favorability/unfavorability rating is a best-in-the-field 72/16, with 42 percent rating him “very favorably.” He’s second behind only Warren in second-choice support, and is nicely positioned ideologically, with 63 percent rating him “about right” instead of “too liberal” (7 percent) or “too conservative” (13 percent). By contrast, 53 percent said Bernie Sanders was “too liberal” and 38 percent said the same of Warren, while 28 percent labeled Biden as “too conservative.”

Buttigieg also led in a recent Monmouth poll in Iowa, and was functionally tied with the other members of the Big Four in others, and now leads the RealClearPolitics polling average for the state. If there’s any downside in his Iowa polling it’s that he may be peaking too early; a potential Biden-alternative centrist, Amy Klobuchar, is gradually moving up in the rankings. (She’s fifth in the Selzer poll at 6 percent; no one else has more than 3 percent.)

If Iowa is at the moment looking like Pete Country, his standing is significantly weaker in other early states. He’s at 14 percent in the RCP averages in Iowa’s kissing-cousin and rival, New Hampshire, and at around 7 percent in Nevada and South Carolina. And best we can tell from available crosstabs, Buttigieg is still registering negligible support from minority voters, which is no big handicap in Iowa and New Hampshire, but begins to matter a lot more the minute after New Hampshire ends. A new Fox News poll of Nevada shows Mayor Pete with 2 percent of the nonwhite vote there. (He’s behind Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard among nonwhite voters.) And a Monmouth poll of South Carolina a few weeks ago placed Buttigieg’s support among the black voters who represent well over half the primary electorate at one percent. Even if he wins Iowa, he won’t get much of a bounce beyond New Hampshire until that begins to change.

Still, at the moment you’d rather be him than, say, Kamala Harris or Cory Booker, who also invested heavily in an Iowa organization but are both at 3 percent in Selzer’s poll, and who trail Buttigieg in Nevada and aren’t doing much better than him in South Carolina despite being African-Americans themselves. If, as is quite possibly the case, only four candidates survive Iowa in any kind of viable shape, at this point it looks like it will be Warren, Biden, Sanders — and Pete Buttigieg."

He could win Iowa, which then often leads to a win in New Hampshire; then that momentum could propel him along through the rest of the primaries.

They were Republicans, however, and the Republican Party tends to be much more interested in candidates with little or no apparent qualifications to be president than Democrats are. The closer we get to the voting, the more difficult it may be for Buttigieg to assure primary voters that the 37-year-old mayor of the 306th largest city in the United States — bigger than Kenosha, Wis., but not quite as big as West Covina, Calif., — really is qualified to be president of the United States.

That’s because Democrats are rather traditional when it comes to candidate qualifications. They took a chance on the youthful Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, but Obama was a senator and Clinton a governor, despite being not that much older than Buttigieg is. (Clinton was 46 and Obama was 47 when they were elected.) They have tended to gravitate toward candidates with extensive government experience, because as the party that believes in government, they want someone who understands it and is capable of making it work effectively.

What he lacks in experience, Buttigieg makes up for in confidence, the kind that comes from having been told a thousand times that he’s going places. Watching him, one can’t help but be reminded of what was once said about a young Al Gore, that he was an old person’s idea of what a young person should be. It’s notable that much as he may talk about generational change, Buttigieg is not actually the candidate of young voters, at least not yet. In the just-released Harvard Youth Poll of voters age 18 to 29, he comes in fifth, with 4 percent support.

Nevertheless, many of his supporters seem to feel that he hits a sweet spot of electability: not too ideological like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but free of the unpredictability surrounding Joe Biden. Yes, he’s gay, but he’s also a white man, which many people find reassuring. “I feel he’s well positioned,” one voter told FiveThirtyEight’s Clare Malone. But electability judgments are fickle; a spate of bad polls or losses in early primaries can quickly make voters decide you look like a loser and not a winner.

Then there’s what may be Buttigieg’s central challenge: Winning over black voters, the heart of the Democratic coalition. So far Buttigieg has polled weakly among them, for a variety of reasons, including controversies over his firing of a black police chief and over police treatment of black residents of South Bend, and a pragmatic tendency in black voters that may make them skeptical of supporting a 30-something small town mayor for president.

Buttigieg has tried to reach out to them with a “Douglass Plan” (named for Frederick Douglass) to address racial inequality, but that has led to some missteps, including the use of a stock photo to illustrate it that turned out to be of a woman and child from Kenya, and touting supporters of the plan who were not exactly supporters.

Those are the kind of staff blunders that, like much of what happens in the campaign, tell you little if anything about what sort of president Buttigieg would be. But he has very little room for error. When you’re that young and that inexperienced, you don’t want to give voters any reason to think you might not be up to the task of the world’s most important job.

Barack Obama broke his silence on the 2020 Democratic primary Friday with a stern warning to his party’s presidential hopefuls. “Voters, including Democrats, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain … Twitter feeds, or the activist wing of our party,” Obama said. “And that’s not a criticism to the activist wing — their job is to poke and prod and text and inspire and motivate. But the candidate’s job, whoever that ends up being, is to get elected.”

The Democratic base will bristle at these sentiments. We all want to believe that the Venn diagram of our preferred policies — and the most electorally expedient ones — is a perfect circle. We all want our leaders to stop mincing words, and start making a bold, unapologetic case for our agenda until its moral truth becomes unmistakable to all (or at least a plurality of voters in Wisconsin). But that just isn’t how politics works. And the stakes of evicting Trump from the Oval Office next year are too high for Democrats to use their presidential primary as a venue for its base’s ideological self-expression. The party’s rank-and-file may revere Joe Biden more than any other candidate. Nevertheless, they must heed Obama’s advice — and recognize that Uncle Joe’s far-out views on weed would harsh the heartland’s vibes.

At a town hall in Las Vegas, Nevada, Saturday, the Democratic front-runner was asked if his longtime opposition to the legalization of marijuana has changed. Here’s how he replied:

No, it hasn’t changed. I think, look, I think states should be able to make a judgement to legalize marijuana. I think that’s okay. But let me tell ya, the truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that’s been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug. It’s a debate. And I want a lot more, before I legalize it nationally, I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it. That’s why I want to move it from a Schedule 1 drug to a Schedule 3, so you can in fact do this.

Biden said states should decide on legalization & that he supports medical marijuana. @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/s4CE32phLS — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) November 17, 2019

This position may play well with anti-legalization activists on Twitter, or nanny-state-loving paleo-progressives. But salt-of-the-earth Americans in flyover country want big government to keep its hands off their bongs.

A Pew Research survey released last week found that 67 percent of Americans believe “the use of marijuana should be made legal.” A recent Gallup poll put that figure at (a statistically identical) 66 percent. Critically, weed legalization isn’t just popular with the public as a whole, but also with key Electoral College constituencies. In Pew’s survey, non-college-educated voters — who are overrepresented in battleground states — were even more likely to support legalization than college-educated ones, with only 31 percent of working-class Americans backing Biden’s stance.

This comports with the findings of a recent poll from the progressive think tank Data for Progress and data-science firm Civis Analytics. By fielding a large-sample national survey and then applying state-of-the-art demographic modeling techniques to its results, DFP was able to estimate the level of support for marijuana legalization in all 50 states. It found legal weed polling at (a very nice) 69 percent among all registered voters in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and at 68 percent with such voters in Michigan. Meanwhile, independent voters in those states backed legalization at even higher levels, with nearly three-fourths of indie Michiganders, Wisconsinite, and Pennsylvanians voicing approval (support among independents in Sun Belt battlegrounds like Florida and Arizona was nearly identical). What’s more, in an unsurprising finding — given younger Americans’ relatively high affinity for marijuana and low propensity for casting ballots — support for legalizing weed among registered nonvoters in battleground states hovered around 75 percent. The analysis’s most remarkable finding, however, may have been this: A majority of Trump voters in 49 U.S. states backed an end to weed prohibition.

Marijuana legalization might not be the most important or salient issue of the day. But there simply aren’t many other policy fights that are more favorable to the Democratic Party. Hoping to win back non-college-educated independents in the Rust Belt? Nearly three-quarters of them want Uncle Sam to recognize their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of dank kush. Want to run a “mobilization” campaign that brings Dem-leaning nonvoters off of democracy’s sidelines? Virtually all of them are high on legal weed. Worried that narrowcasting to targeted constituencies could pull Democrats too far from the American mainstream? Even among Republican voters, a solid majority are 420 friendly.

Biden’s defenders will note that he doesn’t oppose the decriminalization of marijuana possession, only the legalization of its sale. But such equivocation just blunts the Democrats’ advantage on the issue, by needlessly killing the buzz of pro-pot constituencies and advocacy organizations. On weed legalization, the preferred policy of the cause’s most ardent supporters is the same as that of critical swing voters. Biden’s stance demobilizes the former, for the sake of appealing slightly less to the latter. Virtually every other candidate in the 2020 race recognizes the folly of Biden’s stance: Everyone from Amy Klobuchar to Pete Buttigieg to Bernie Sanders has endorsed legalizing recreational marijuana in no uncertain terms.

Biden’s decision to put principle above political expediency on this issue may command respect in some quarters. But we’ve seen where that gets us. Hillary Clinton heeded the radical center’s demands for ideological purity on pot in 2016, and two pro-legalization third-party candidates combined for an exceptionally high share of ballots, thereby eroding her margin for error in key Rust Belt states. Democrats can’t afford to make the same mistake twice. They must hear the subtext of Obama’s advice: It would be nothing short of political malpractice to vote for Joe Biden and his reefer madness."
118,Jennifer Rubin,"In Long Beach, Buttigieg told the crowd, I also believe that being bold and having good ideas should not be measured by how many people you alienate.

In keeping with that message, Buttigieg told Democrats in Nevada, “I’m running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, gather up the pieces of our divided nation and lead us toward a better future.” On health care specifically, he promised, “Rather than polarize the American people, I will mobilize the American majority that stands ready for the most progressive change to health care in a half century — finally delivering Medicare for All Who Want It — as long as we protect the freedom to decide for yourself whether you want it.” He added for emphasis: “Even if you don’t agree with the precise dimensions of this or that policy, that does not mean you should be written out of a particular political party. You belong.”

He came back repeatedly to the theme of unity. He called for support ""whether you are a progressive or a moderate or what I like to call a future former Republican.” To lead and win, he said, “It is going to take a lot more than the political warfare we’ve come to expect in Washington, D.C. We already have a divider in chief.”

In a similar vein, Klobuchar told the Nevada audience, “We are at our best when we bring people together.” She made clear that Democrats can win, as they did in the Kentucky and Louisiana gubernatorial races and in the Virginia state legislature, when they turn out the base “but also some independents and some moderate Republicans who are sick and tired of this guy.” She added, “We are at our best when we bring people together instead of shutting them out.” To win “big” by taking the presidency and the Senate, she says, “We need to bring the country with us.”

You would be forgiven if you thought these were part of a long-running jab at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who until she unveiled her “transition” plan on Medicare-for-all was writing former vice president Joe Biden out of the party (“running in the wrong presidential primary”) for opposing Medicare-for-all. (Presumably Warren was also writing out many of the other Democratic presidential candidates and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also disfavor that approach.) Given the blowback that Warren received on Medicare-for-all, and her retreat to a stopgap that looks a lot like the plans Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar put forward, the two Midwest moderates are applying some valuable lessons.

AD

AD

First, a sizable number of the Democratic primary electorate voters are very nervous about selecting a candidate too far to the left who will fail to pick up winnable voters and winnable states. Recent state polling has added to the sense of anxiety that the Midwest is hardly in the bag. Conversely, they saw conservative Democrats win in governor’s races in two red states, Kentucky and Louisiana. If Democrats want to win big, they had better think about how their policies, tone and personality are going to come across beyond the two coasts.

Klobuchar recently made a tour of “blue wall” states that Democrats know they must win (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin). She speaks of herself as the candidate from the heartland. This is not just about geography. She says she knows that these people — “workers and farmers who are my friends and neighbors” — from these states are not looking for a revolution. When Klobuchar says, as she did in Nevada, that Democrats ""cannot screw this up,” she strikes a chord with party donors, insiders and ordinary voters who fear they might do exactly that.

Second, the country, Democrats included, is suffering from Trump exhaustion. Buttigieg promises that with him in the White House, our blood pressure will go down, not up. Perhaps serenity is not possible in a highly polarized and tribalistic political era, but there is something to be said about someone who sounds like the calmest person in the room. Buttigieg’s measured style is certainly a contrast with President Trump, and demonstrates that one need not be soporific to engender confidence. No one would accuse Klobuchar, who deploys wisecracks at Trump’s expense, of being dull, but her no-nonsense approach speaks to Americans who want attainable, concrete advances (e.g. limits on prescription drug costs).

AD

AD

Finally, Klobuchar and Buttigieg are taking issue with the notion that if they don’t “fight” everyone and everything, progressive change is impossible. Klobuchar says she doesn’t want to be president for “half of America,” just as Buttigieg talks about picking up the pieces Trump leaves behind. They know they cannot rely on Democratic majorities or supermajorities.

They are not relying on a Republican epiphany; they want to win big and then peel off Republicans willing to join their agenda. Is that unrealistic? It’s certainly more realistic than imagining that Wisconsin, Michigan or other Midwest voters want a revolution to remake health care, decriminalize illegal border crossings or offer “free” college (among other things). These candidates are betting that Democrats want a nominee fresher and younger than Biden but firmly planted in the center-left. In a way, Warren’s retreat suggests that she might agree with that analysis.

AD

Her new pitch also seems designed to assuage voters worried that her earlier approach would force 150 million people off their private insurance. Her ability to sell this new plan — and refocus her campaign on her larger message of reform — will be a key test for her candidacy.

AD

The toll on her campaign is particularly apparent here in Iowa, where a new poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN released Saturday night showed Warren in a three-way tie for second place with former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), while South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg surged ahead of the pack. The poll shows Buttigieg with 25 percent support and Warren, Biden and Sanders all with about 15 percent support.

Before this most recent poll, an average of five statewide polls since October showed Warren at 20 percent support among likely Democratic caucus-goers, Biden at 18 percent, Buttigieg at 17 percent and Sanders at 16 percent, with other candidates averaging 4 percent or less.

AD

Warren has struggled to outline a plan for health care, saying earlier this month that she supports Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan but would pay for it differently.

AD

On Friday, she announced she will push Congress to pass legislation that allows all Americans to opt into the existing Medicare program in her first 100 days in office and take executive actions even sooner to lower the price of prescription drugs.

She wouldn’t push for full-blown Medicare-for-all until the third year of her term.

That has prompted Sanders to adjust, adding a line to his stump speech that contrasts Warren’s approach to his.

“Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all ­single-payer legislation,” he said Saturday in East Los Angeles.

AD

Polls consistently show that Iowa Democrats say health care is their top issue and also that many Democrats have conflicted views about Medicare-for-all.

A recent New York Times-Siena College poll found that over 7 in 10 likely caucusgoers support “a single-payer health care system, which would abolish private insurance and provide every American with a government health insurance.”

AD

But the same poll also found that more Democrats prefer a candidate who “promises to improve the existing health insurance system” rather than “replace the current health care system with Medicare-for-all.”

Several who attended Warren’s town hall Saturday were relieved by her new approach.

AD

“I like the shift,” said Elizabeth Texley, 43, of Cedar Rapids. Texley works with seniors and hasn’t yet decided who she will support in the upcoming caucuses.

“The goal of Medicare-for-all is great,” she said. “But I don’t think you’re going to be able to get everybody on board right now.”

Warren’s new proposal, Texley added, “does make it easier to support her.”

Kristina Burroughes, 28, said she wants Medicare-for-all to happen quickly but believes Warren’s adjustment is smart strategy. “It’s walking into it instead of diving,” Burroughes said as she waited in line for a photo with the candidate.

AD

In Iowa, Warren also tried to explain how her new plan differs from the proposal laid out by Buttigieg. Her plan, she argued, would get more people on government insurance for less money.

AD

“Mine is about actually giving people Medicare-for-all that is going to be full health-care coverage,” she said when asked about the differences. “I’m going to bring in as many people as we can right at the beginning.”

Sean Savett, a spokesman for Buttigieg, said that the Buttigieg plan preserves private insurance for those who want it. “Pete’s plan would also achieve universal health care coverage,” he said. “But unlike Senator Warren, he wouldn’t kick tens of millions of American families off their private health care plans because he trusts the American people to choose what’s right for them.”

But some voters didn’t detect a large difference between the two — aside from timing.

AD

AD

“She’s a week late for me,” said Conni Miller, 59 of Waverly, who came to Warren’s town hall even though she just committed to support Buttigieg largely because of his heath-care plan.

A key part of Warren’s gambit is to remain close enough to Sanders’s plan so that his voters would, at some point, support her. But among Sanders’s supporters gathered Saturday afternoon, there was deep skepticism.

“I think it’s terrible,” said Eduardo Barrio, 23, of San Bernardino, Calif. “She’s not going to be fighting for it.”

“There’s a gap [between] them,” he added. “She’s clearly the second-best option, but why have the copy when you can have the OG?”

NASHUA, N.H. — On Friday, after another day of impeachment hearings, Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado gave a few dozen voters his recap. Diplomats were fighting against “the destruction and the carnage of our institutions.” Trump strategist Roger Stone had been convicted of lying about connections to WikiLeaks.

“It felt like the rule of law was pushing back again,” Bennet said. “I think today was a great day.”

Within seconds, Bennet had moved on to talk about public education. Impeachment didn’t come up again over nearly an hour and a half of voter conversations. Bennet talked more about South Bend., Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his thin electoral record (“Mayor Pete won 8,000 votes”) than he did about the president.

Bennet was demonstrating one of the true surprises of this Democratic primary so far: the inability of President Trump to affect it. The president’s 2016 upset looms over the contest, with Democratic voters asking their candidates how they could win the Midwest again, or how they’d face Trump in a debate. But as 10 Democrats prepare for their fifth televised debate, the president's behavior — his nicknames, his insults, the latest impeachment revelation — has blurred into background noise.

That wasn't the expectation when the race began. In his first campaign, through a mix of strategy and brash accidents, Trump was able to turn week after week of Republican primary news into a story about him. In the run-up to this campaign, pundits ranked his greatest insults and speculated about how any lower-wattage candidate (i.e., any candidate) would be able to command a news cycle.

“The president has an ability to use social media to define his opponents and influence the primary debate in a way no sitting president before him has,” former White House spokesman Raj Shah told the Associated Press in February.

Instead, the president has been largely irrelevant in the day-to-day Democratic contest. Candidates are rarely asked to respond to his quotes. His “Pocahontas” insult, directed at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), still gets made, but doesn't make news. His attempt to ridicule Buttigieg as “Alfred E. Neumann” is so dimly remembered that the Indiana mayor, on a recent bus tour, was asked what he would do when Trump gave him a nickname. Trump's tweet calling Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota a “snow woman,” because she announced her candidacy during a blizzard, is so beloved by the candidate herself that she still mentions it in speeches.

Even major events in which the president played a big role have left the Democratic primary undisturbed. Sixteen years ago, the capture of Saddam Hussein rocked the Democratic primary, as President George W. Bush’s approval rating surged and as Howard Dean’s opponents refocused the race on his perceived “electability” problems. This year, the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi hardly caused a ripple, with Democrats quickly giving the credit to the military and the president’s own numbers staying flat.

Impeachment overwhelms all of it, and impeachment has been a sideshow for primary voters; at campaign events, they rarely ask about it. The irony, which Joe Biden has pointed out at his own events, is that the impeachment grew out of Trump's interest in the Democratic primary — specifically, his hope that Ukraine could provide dirt on Hunter Biden's work in the country and hurt his father, the former vice president.

“The more pressure he's under, the more erratic he becomes,” Biden told donors in Portland, Ore. on Saturday. “I mean, it's becoming truly erratic.”

But the Biden campaign's angle, that Trump was accidentally telling voters which Democrat he most feared, has not gotten through to primary voters. In the two months since The Washington Post first reported on a whistleblower's complaint about the pressure Trump put on Ukraine, Biden has dropped from 24.5 percent to 17.6 percent in an average of Iowa polls from RealClearPolitics, but polling has found that almost no Democrats think there is substance to Trump's attacks. Every Democratic rival has come to Biden's defense.

“It is not just about impeachment proceedings,” Klobuchar told reporters during her weekend swing through southern California. “They look at him in the White House and they say, we are not putting our country first. He's not protecting the interests of America first.”

It was typical of how Democrats usually talk about Trump: a catchall attack on how he's running things, followed as quickly as possible by the issue they want to talk about.

Impeachment has not dramatically altered the Democratic contest, but it has begun to expose weaknesses that didn't exist for Trump in 2016. One of them is obvious: He was able to command more attention with frequent campaign rallies than he does with this campaign's more intermittent “MAGA” events. Nothing Trump said in the most recent events, which he used to campaign for Republican gubernatorial candidates in Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi, lasted into the next day's news cycle. And Republicans in the first two of those three states lost, giving short-term confidence boosts to panicky Democrats.

One of those worries, when it came to impeachment, was that the president would rally his political base while no other topic broke through. The red-state gubernatorial losses cut against the first worry, while the second has come true in a way that largely hurts Trump. His feuds are more frequently with the impeachment witnesses and inquisitors than anyone running to take his job. That keeps him out of the Democrats' conversation and traps him in a more confusing one that primary voters aren't always following.

Some days, the president isn't targeted by Democrats at all. Only a handful of the ads Democrats have run in Iowa mention Trump at all; Buttigieg, who has risen quickly in Iowa, mentions him only by way of asking voters to picture America when he's gone. Over the past week, Warren ran just the second TV spot of her campaign, a targeted ad for CNBC to advertise her 2 percent tax on the super-rich.

“It is time for a wealth tax in America,” Warren says in the ad. “I’ve heard that there are some billionaires who don’t support this plan.”

Four billionaires, all critics of Warren, then appear on screen. Not among them: Trump, who says he is a billionaire but has stopped short of sharing tax records that could verify his net worth.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards made political history Saturday: He became the first Democrat to win a second term as governor in the state since 1975, and the first governor of either party to win after being forced into a runoff. And for the second time this month, the White House bet the president's political capital on a struggling Republican candidate for governor in a deep red state — and lost.

“You’ve got to give me a big win, okay?” Trump told voters at an 11th-hour rally for Eddie Rispone, the wealthy businessman who had forced the runoff election. Rispone fell 40,341 votes short, according to the state's initial count, out of more than 1.5 million votes cast. Outside of Mississippi, where Gov.-elect Tate Reeves was edging into the lead before Trump rallied for him, the president ended his year on a losing streak.

Republicans stuck by the president, as they'd done after this month's loss in Kentucky, and with identical messaging. “Eddie Rispone made up about a 22-point disadvantage over the last month because of President Trump's involvement,” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who had been urged to run against Edwards and declined. “Rispone was at about 27 [percent] in the primary, ended up at 49 [percent]. So, clearly, President Trump's involvement made a big difference in helping close that massive gap. And look, the governor's polling showed he was about 50 before President Trump first started to get involved. That forced a runoff.”

There was truth in this: Edwards had been edging toward a clean primary win in October, before sluggish early voting and a last-minute Trump rally forced the runoff. (In Louisiana, all party candidates compete in one primary, with the top two finishers facing off again if no one clears 50 percent.) But Republicans had hoped that forcing a runoff would doom Edwards, as Democrats struggled to rally for another election. Instead, he won.

How'd he do it? By getting more Democratic voters to the polls and converting suburbanites who were uncomfortable with Rispone's largely negative, Trump-focused campaign. Turnout increased from October to November, from 1,343,478 votes to 1,508,597 votes. In October, Republicans, led by Rispone and Rep. Ralph Abraham, clearly won more votes than Edwards and a fringe Democratic candidate: 696,399 for the GOP to just 636,993 for the other guys.

On Saturday, Rispone won 734,128 votes, which would have been a rout in October. But Edwards surged, winning 148,469 more votes than he had in the first round. In Orleans Parish, the biggest single source of Democratic votes, he won 86,281 votes in October and 114,812 votes in November. In the West and East Baton Rouge parishes, his vote total grew from 89,898 to 110,523. The new votes from the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metro areas more than made up Edwards's statewide win margin.

Edwards built a sort of “blue wall” that Rispone could not overcome, especially because of the Republican's weakness in the northeast Louisiana parishes where Trump had campaigned. That part of the state, which Abraham represents in Congress, had decisively backed him in October. It never truly embraced Rispone. While Trump had carried the region by 29.4 points, Rispone carried it by just 9.2 points.

Rispone did best in the state's 3rd Congressional District, across the old Cajun region that had voted reliably Democratic for decades until Barack Obama's presidency. He lost, among other reasons, because as that pattern broke, the state voted a bit more like the rest of the country: rural white voters for the GOP, and suburbanites for the Democrats. In a final irony, forcing the runoff might have ended up hurting the president's party, as higher turnout helped Democrats flip the 105th state legislative district, which stretches from the New Orleans suburbs to the Gulf of Mexico. That will prevent Republicans from holding a legislative supermajority in 2020 or 2021, giving Edwards the Democrats' first chance since 2001 to shape the state's congressional map.

POLL WATCH

Iowa caucuses (Selzer & Co, 500 likely caucusgoers)

Pete Buttigieg — 25% ( 16)

Elizabeth Warren — 16% (-6)

Joe Biden — 15% (-5)

Bernie Sanders — 15% ( 4)

Cory Booker — 3% ( 0)

Kamala D. Harris — 3% (-3)

Tom Steyer — 3% ( 1)

Andrew Yang — 3% ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 3% ( 1)

Mike Bloomberg — 2% ( 2)

Michael F. Bennet — 1% ( 1)

The gold standard of Iowa polls has uncommon power to change the way people look at this race. Before this poll, it had looked as though Buttigieg was breaking through, with giant crowds, strong organizing and a rebuffed image as the young liberal who wants to unify the country. After this poll, that's all undeniable: Buttigieg has figured out exactly what exhausted Iowa Democrats are craving. They want freshness, they want center-left politics, and they are less worried about experience than whether a candidate can perform.

Buttigieg is now the best-liked Democrat in the field, with Warren right behind, but just as telling is the trend since December 2018. Joe Biden is viewed less favorably than he was then by 35 points; Sanders, by 26 points. Warren, who was generally known at that time but has increased to near-universal name recognition, has seen her favorables head up by a net of 3 points. Buttigieg, who was almost totally unknown, has seen his favorable rating spike by 49 points.

Nevada caucuses (Fox News, 1,506 voters)

Joe Biden — 24%

Bernie Sanders — 18%

Elizabeth Warren — 18%

Pete Buttigieg — 8%

Tom Steyer — 5%

Kamala D. Harris — 4%

Andrew Yang — 3%

Tulsi Gabbard — 2%

Amy Klobuchar — 2%

Cory Booker — 1%

Julián Castro — 1%

Buttigieg's rise, for now, is being welcomed by the Sanders campaign, and it's not being feared by the Biden campaign. This is why: The Indiana mayor has still not become competitive with nonwhite voters, whose input is decisive once the campaign leaves New Hampshire. Here, as in most polls of Nevada and South Carolina, there's a real battle for the white vote between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren; he gets 23 percent, she gets 21 percent.

Buttigieg is about tied with Sanders among white voters, but the senator from Vermont, as in many of the states where he campaigned extensively four years ago, is strong with Latinos: He gets 31 percent of those voters, to just 1 percent for Buttigieg. The backup dream scenario for the Sanders campaign (i.e., the dream that doesn't start with him winning Iowa) is one where Buttigieg beats the field in the first, heavily white states, then splits college-educated whites with Biden as Sanders consolidates young voters and competes strongly for nonwhite voters.

Whatever happens with Elizabeth Warren and her newly detailed Medicare-for-all transition plan, we know what happened during its genesis: She fell out of the Democrats' sweet spot. Until October, Warren was generally viewed by primary voters as a markedly more pragmatic candidate than Sanders. Her rhetoric solidified that: He called for political revolution and an end to billionaires, while she had a 2-cent wealth tax and defined herself as a capitalist. The attack on Medicare-for-all, led by the insurance industry but echoed by some Democratic candidates, hurt Sanders more than Warren in early states.

After a month of plans that make Warren's design clear — a massive expansion of Medicare at the start of her presidency, followed by a phaseout of private insurance — she is viewed as more liberal than before.

2020

Elizabeth Warren. She introduced her own transition plan for Medicare-for-all, which differs from the one offered by Bernie Sanders: It would use the budget reconciliation process to start expanding Medicare and automatically enrolling the uninsured in the system. “Unlike public option plans,' Warren wrote, “the benefits of the true Medicare for All option will match those in the Medicare for All Act. This includes truly comprehensive coverage for primary and preventive services, pediatric care, emergency services and transportation, vision, dental, audio, long-term care, mental health and substance use, and physical therapy.”

Mike Bloomberg. He hasn't launched his campaign yet, if he follows through on it at all. But he used a Sunday morning address to Brooklyn's Christian Cultural Center to apologize for the “stop and frisk” police policy that he defended as mayor. “I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong,” he said. “Far too many innocent people were being stopped. And the overwhelming majority of them were black and Latino. That may have included, I’m sorry to say, some of you here today, or perhaps your children or grandchildren, or your neighbors or relatives.”

Bernie Sanders. He won the support of the 34,000-member United Teachers Los Angeles union, something that was possible in this cycle because the American Federation of Teachers gave some more wiggle room for locals to announce their own endorsements. Sanders also stood out for criticizing the United States' speedy recognition of Bolivia's new government, which took power after the country's military forced out President Evo Morales.

“At the end of the day, it was the military who intervened in that process and asked him to leave,” Sanders told Univision's Jorge Ramos at a Saturday forum in Los Angeles. “In my view, that’s a coup.”

Kamala Harris. She scored her first labor union endorsement: the United Farm Workers, whose co-founder Dolores Huerta had endorsed her campaign earlier this year.

Joe Biden. His campaign cited the newest polling, which finds him trailing in Iowa, in an all-hands-on-deck email to donors. “Yesterday, we got a new poll in Iowa and honestly it's not what we want to see,” it read. “Right now we are tied for 3rd in Iowa. Losing Iowa doesn't mean we can't win, but it makes winning the primary harder and more expensive.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Whatever else happens to their presidential dreams, Deval Patrick and Mike Bloomberg have already made history. They are declaring, or on the verge of declaring, later than any primary candidate has in this century. Not since December 1991, when Pat Buchanan launched his quixotic conservative challenge to George H.W. Bush, has any contender announced this close to the first primaries. Not since the 1980s has a Democrat entered the primaries without a plan to qualify in every state; Patrick has forfeited the Alabama and Arkansas primaries, while Bloomberg, if he runs, is going to skip the first four states.

What's the record of candidacies like this? Not good.

First, understand that the ultramodern Democratic primary, which assigns delegates to the winners of primaries and caucuses, dates back to only 1984. Before that, some states had conventions where nominees won endorsements and delegates; before that, the party combined a few primaries with more opaque contests for the support of party leaders. (Think of a “smoke-filled room.”)

Winning the modern Democratic nomination means organizing in each state, which makes buzzer-beating campaigns even harder. Patrick's campaign has been compared to the 2003 effort that drafted Wesley Clark into the Democratic primary; Clark announced a full month earlier, relative to the first contests, than Patrick. (In 2004, 2008 and 2012, the first states voted in January, not February.) Clark, like Fred Thompson four years later, announced in September of the year before voting began; Rick Perry, whose 2012 Republican bid was undone by his unpreparedness, announced in August 2011. The tail end of summer is usually the make-or-break point for serious candidacies, not November.

Perry, Thompson and Clark had something else in common: They lost. It's always risky to draw a historical trend from the small sample size of contested presidential primaries. Let's do it anyway: Since 1984, the winner of the Democratic primary has announced his or her candidacy at least four months before the first contests. Just two candidates who declared later than that won any primaries: Jesse Jackson, whose 1984 campaign was victorious in the District of Columbia, Louisiana and Mississippi, and Clark, whose 2004 campaign carried Oklahoma.

WHAT I'M WATCHING

The fraying “super PAC” truce. One month ago, the Democratic candidates for president agreed on one thing: They would not endorse “super PACs.” There would be no outside source of endless money running ads for or against them in key states.

Joe Biden was the first Democrat to break with that pledge, and other candidates are getting more PAC-curious, especially as Mike Bloomberg's candidacy looms. In his first news conference as a candidate, on Friday, Deval Patrick said that he would not rule out a super PAC, as he'd had such a late start already, and needed to compete with candidates who'd already introduced themselves.

“I wish it weren't so,” Patrick said. “I wish the campaigns weren't as expensive.” He repeated that rationale on Sunday's “Meet the Press,” telling host Chuck Todd that any super PAC should disclose its donors. “I think we need to do some catch-up,” he explained.

Separately, in a short interview with The Post, Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado said that he would not tell a super PAC to back down if it was created to help his candidacy.

“I'm all for it,” Bennet said. “I wouldn't dissuade them.”

Patrick, Bennet and Biden remain outnumbered: Most of the Democratic field has refused to give its blessing to a super PAC. On Friday, as he filed for the New Hampshire primary, Cory Booker reiterated that he did not want support from a super PAC; at the same time, Elizabeth Warren's campaign denounced an effort by a supportive donor to buy pro-Warren ads in Iowa.

AD

Tier 4

13. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii): Ever since Hillary Clinton speculated that Gabbard would be recruited to run a third-party campaign, Gabbard has been … sounding a lot like a third-party candidate. She called Clinton the “personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long” and announced she wouldn’t seek reelection to her House seat, in the face of a tough primary. But she still says she won’t run third-party. Expect her to be more of a focal point at Wednesday’s Washington Post/NBC News debate, but she’s selling something with limited appeal for this electorate. (Previous ranking: 12)

AD

12. Businessman Tom Steyer: Money can’t buy you happiness, but it can rent you a place on the debate stage. Steyer spent a whopping $47 million of his own funds in the third quarter and got enough early-state polls to qualify for the last debate and this one. He still hasn’t done much with the platform, though. (Previous ranking: 11)

AD

11. Andrew Yang: Still plugging along, and apparently betting on New Hampshire while others are betting on Iowa. (Previous ranking: 10)

Tier 3

10. Former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro: Unlike the three candidates above, Castro didn’t qualify for Wednesday’s debate. In fact, his campaign is in pretty dire straits, both financially and polling-wise. I still see him as a more likely nominee than the previous three, in that he’s shown the kind of things you’d expect from someone who could plausibly take advantage of a topsy-turvy race. And he’s still a legitimate vice presidential prospect. (Previous ranking: 8)

9. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg: The first new entry on this list, I’ve got him a tier below Patrick because I just have a difficult time seeing why Democrats would go for Bloomberg. He aligns with them on key issues like guns and climate, but he’s a billionaire with some baggage, and a poll showed he’s already the most unpopular candidate — before he even gets in. I’m also somewhat skeptical he’ll eventually run; remember that he was filing for primaries because he had to if he ever wanted to run, not because he’s definitely in. His decision not to file for the early states is also quite the head-scratcher, given he had time to do so. (Previous ranking: N/A)

AD

AD

Tier 2

8. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick: Patrick isn’t a billionaire, but he does come to this primary from the party’s more corporate wing. Heck, he’s been working at the Mitt Romney-founded Bain Capital since 2015. But he’s a gifted messenger and someone plenty of high-profile Democrats have apparently wanted to run for a long time, including possibly Barack Obama. He should have a seat at the table, even as his late start is obviously not great. (Previous ranking: N/A)

7. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.): Booker hadn’t gotten much traction to this point, but Bloomberg and Patrick probably make his path even more difficult. They’re both viable options for more business-friendly Democrats, they’re both from the Northeast like Booker, and Patrick could be a candidate to pick off the black voters who haven’t really gravitated to Booker. It’s still too early to call Booker a bust, though. (Previous ranking: 6)

6. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.): A new automated Public Policy Polling survey shows her climbing to 9 percent in Iowa. That’s her highest to date, but it’s hardly the first to suggest she’s climbing in that state. Despite this momentum, she declared she would root for her home-state Gophers against the University of Iowa on Saturday. This Minnesota alumna admires those principles (even if they lost). (Previous ranking: 7)

AD

AD

5. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.): She’s polling like an also-ran, and now there are reports of a campaign in turmoil. Her candidacy might be the biggest disappointment thus far, given her potential. (Previous ranking: 4)

Tier 1

4. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Speaking of Iowa, Buttigieg moves into the top tier thanks to the authoritative Des Moines Register poll showing him opening up a significant lead there. He’s at 25 percent, with Elizabeth Warren in second at 16 percent and Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden at 15 percent. It’s no fluke; he’s been virtually tied for the lead there in the previous four polls, too (including the PPP poll). He’s not polling like a top-tier candidate nationally or in other early states, notably, but he’s clearly an attractive candidate to Iowa Democrats, and if he wins there … ? (Previous ranking: 5)

AD

AD

3. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): While he waned a little in Iowa early on, the suddenly crowded pack of leaders there seems jumbled enough that he may not need to get to 30 percent to win. For someone with a very devoted base, that makes him a clear player. And if he wins Iowa, he’s got a big leg up in New Hampshire. (Previous ranking: 3)

2. Former vice president Joe Biden: You have to think Patrick and Bloomberg are doing this at least in part because they don’t see Biden effectively carrying the banner of the more moderate wing of the Democratic Party against Sanders and Warren. It’s not like Biden has really fallen in the polls, but there is clearly concern about his long-term viability if these candidates see an opening. (Previous ranking: 2)

1. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.): One of the undersold dynamics of the 2020 race is all the big business types attacking her — and probably helping her in the process, the latest being Lloyd Blankfein. Well, she’s suddenly seizing on it, with her campaign selling a mug that says “billionaire tears” on the side. Expect this to be a theme. (Previous ranking: 1)

The Campaign

OK BOOMER, LISTEN UP: A majority of young Americans believe President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, according to a study out this morning from the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School.

That includes 52 percent of young Americans and 58 percent of likely general election voters under 30 who want Trump gone. Only 28 percent of likely voters feel differently.

Tribalism : Among young Republicans, an overwhelming majority do not believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office: 82 percent disagreed and 14 percent agreed the president should be impeached and removed.

: Among young Republicans, an overwhelming majority do not believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office: 82 percent disagreed and 14 percent agreed the president should be impeached and removed. But: Only 23 percent of young likely voters — aged 18 to 29 — think the nation is generally headed in the right direction and 58 percent believe that we are on the wrong track.

Big, structural change can't wait. Or maybe it can: While young Americans are largely united in their opposition to Trump, they're more conflicted on how to move forward.

Young voters are divided on the kind of governing philosophy they want to see their favored 2020 candidate embrace — someone who supports “policies that stand a good chance of being achieved as opposed to sweeping changes that will be difficult to carry out” versus a candidate who is proposing “big structural policy changes that address the urgency of the problems that we are facing, even if they will not be easy to carry out.”

“Young Americ a ns in a post-Trump world are divided on the scope of change they seek in Washington. Among likely 2020 young voters, pragmatic has taken the lead in the race between pragmatic and progressive, ” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Institute of Politics. “When looking at young Democratic primary voters, bold structural change is preferred, but not by as much as you might think.”

“Among young Americans who are most likely to vote in the November 2020 general election, we find support for the more pragmatic approach, 44% to 40%,"" according to the poll. But for those likely to vote in a Democratic primary: “45% of these voters prefer the approach that deals with 'big, structural policy changes that address the urgency of the problems that we are facing, even if they will not be easy to carry out,' compared to 39% who prefer the more pragmatic position.”

“45% of these voters prefer the approach that deals with 'big, structural policy changes that address the urgency of the problems that we are facing, even if they will not be easy to carry out,' compared to 39% who prefer the more pragmatic position.” Maybe Obama is right?: “Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,” former president Barack Obama told a group of wealthy Democratic voters on Friday, per the New York Times's Lisa Lerer. “The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.”

That’s more than the 36% who prefer a candidate who backs big ideas, even if there is a lower chance they would become law,” the Des Moines Register's Brianne Pfannenstiel reports.

Despite the mixed feelings about a political revolution, there is at least one issue overwhelmingly supported by young voters:

That's universal background checks: “More than four-in-five (81%) young Americans polled support 'requiring universal background checks for all gun purchases,' with less than 10 percent in opposition,” according to the IOP study.

Silver lining: “While a majority of young Americans (56%) tell us they have more fear than hope at this moment about the future of America, we see a marked improvement in the optimism of young Democrats,” according to the report.

“Last fall, before the midterm election, we found that only 22% of Democrats had hope, 76% fear. Today, we find that 35% are hopeful, while 65% indicate that they are fearful.”

The Investigations

THE WEEK AHEAD IN IMPEACHMENT: On the Hill will be Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, and Tim Morrison, former director of Russian affairs at the National Security Council, among others.

Sondland scoop: Trump's ambassador “kept several Trump administration officials apprised of his effort to get Ukraine to launch investigations that [Trump] would later discuss in a July call with his Ukrainian counterpart, emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show,” the Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus reports. That included White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

More: We previously covered Sondland's precarious legal situation after parts of his testimony were refuted by other witnesses. The diverging story lines — and Sondland's credibility issues — are likely to take center stage at Wednesday's hearing featuring this key witness.

We previously covered Sondland's precarious legal situation after parts of his testimony were refuted by other witnesses. The diverging story lines — and Sondland's credibility issues — are likely to take center stage at Wednesday's hearing featuring this key witness. So far, Sondland has no intention of resigning: “The tension has left a wounded diplomat in charge of managing America’s relationship with the world largest trading bloc amid continuing challenges to his credibility,” our colleagues John Hudson and Michael Birnbaum wrote of the pressure on the former hotelier and real estate maven.

Republicans try a new defense: If 17 other explanations fail, try again. Top Republican lawmakers trotted out an old defense with a new focus on the Sunday shows: Trump did nothing wrong because nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine was ultimately released, the New York Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports.

The shift comes as it will be hard to argue most of the testimony about Trump allegedly trading access and aid for political help is coming from secondhand sources. Sondland talked to the president himself, and NSC aides set to testify were either on the July 25 call or attended meetings where the purported scheme came up.

Key quote: “The Ukrainians did nothing to — as far as investigations goes — to get the aid released,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “So there was never this quid pro quo that the Democrats all promise existed.”

“The Ukrainians did nothing to — as far as investigations goes — to get the aid released,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “So there was never this quid pro quo that the Democrats all promise existed.” The context: As the Times reports, the aid was released “amid a bipartisan uproar on Capitol Hill and revelations of a whistleblower’s report that prompted the impeachment inquiry.”

Meanwhile, Trump attacked another witness who works for his vice president: Trump “continued to take aim at his own administration officials, accusing Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe and Russia, of being a 'Never Trumper,'"" our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, Karoun Demirjian and Douglas MacMillan report.

Williams is set to publicly testify Tuesday. She was on both the July 25 phone call and part of a second conversation between Pence and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelesnky after the hold on the aid was lifted, CNN's Chandelis Duster, Jeremy Diamond and Kaitlan Collins report.

The transcript from her private deposition was released on Saturday: “Williams testified that the call was 'unusual' given the mention of specific investigations,” per our colleagues.

ALSO TESTIFYING: Alexander Vindman (Tuesday): A Soviet emigre and decorated Army officer, Vindman is the top NSC Ukraine expert and was on the July 25 call.

He told lawmakers behind closed doors that Sondland said “after a July 10 meeting with a top Ukrainian official that a long-sought meeting between [Zelensky] and Trump depended upon Ukraine launching specific investigations,” our colleague Aaron Blake previously reported.

Fiona Hill (Thursday): Then a top Russia adviser, Hill worked for John Bolton at the NSC. Hill told lawmakers she was present for the July 10 meeting that exploded when talk of investigations was raised, and later at a small clutch of Ukrainian and U.S. officials that also ended badly.

After the meetings: Bolton urged Hill to go straight to a NSC lawyer and recount what had occurred.

Tim Morrison (Tuesday): A former director of Russian affairs at the NSC, Republicans have claimed Morrison's testimony is a key part of their defense. Morrison ""broke with colleagues in telling House investigators that he heard nothing 'improper' on Trump’s call with Zelensky,” our colleagues Colby Itkowitz, Karoun Demirjian, Michael Kranish and Shane Harris reported over the weekend. Morrison also expressed frustration that Vindman, one of his subordinates, talked to the NSC's top lawyer about the call.

Morrison's testimony will only further embattle Sondland: He told lawmakers that Sondland was, our colleagues write, “acting at Trump’s behest and spoke to a top Ukrainian official about exchanging military aid for political investigations — two elements at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.”

He told lawmakers that Sondland was, our colleagues write, “acting at Trump’s behest and spoke to a top Ukrainian official about exchanging military aid for political investigations — two elements at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.” He also asked for access to the call's rough transcript to be restricted: “Morrison, who left the job at the end of October, said he knew immediately after listening to the call that they needed to keep it under wraps,” our colleagues write. 'I recommended to them that we restrict access to the package,' Morrison said. He said it was the only time he had ever asked the NSC legal team to restrict access.”

Bloomberg apologizes for ""stop and frisk"": ""Ahead of a potential Democratic presidential run, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York ... reversed his longstanding support of the aggressive 'stop-and-frisk' policing strategy that he pursued for a decade and that led to the disproportionate stopping of black and Latino people across the city,"" the Times's Shane Goldmacher reports. “'I was wrong,' [Bloomberg said.] 'And I am sorry.'""

Why this is so significant: ""The speech, [Bloomberg’s] first since he re-emerged as a possible presidential candidate, was a remarkable concession by a 77-year-old billionaire not known for self-doubt: that a pillar of his 12-year mayoralty was a mistake that he now regrets,"" the Times reports.

More on the apology: ""Speaking before the congregation at the Christian Cultural Center, a black megachurch in Brooklyn, [Bloomberg] delivered his apology in the heart of one of the communities most affected by his policing policies, and at a location that nodded to the fact that should he decide to run for president, African-American voters would be a crucial Democratic constituency that he would need to win over.""

Buttigieg's Iowa boomlet: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates,” the Register's Brianne Pfannenstiel reports of the first time the South Bend mayor has led in the poll considered the gold standard in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.

This is my favorite way to look at these results as Iowans are still making up their minds. Who’s on their list?

Buttigieg leads, then Warren. https://t.co/ewz0BI6Pag pic.twitter.com/EwCMKUHLR4 — Brianne Pfannenstiel (@brianneDMR) November 17, 2019

Behind his lead: “When looking at the entire footprint of his support in Iowa, he now leads the field, with 68% saying they are actively considering him in some capacity. That includes the 25% who say he is their first choice, the 14% who name him as their second choice and the 29% who say they are actively considering him,” the Register reports.

He also is the Goldilocks candidate: “Buttigieg fares best of the four candidates, with 63% saying he’s 'about right,' 13% calling him 'too conservative' and 7% saying he’s 'too liberal,'"" the Register reports.

“Buttigieg fares best of the four candidates, with 63% saying he’s 'about right,' 13% calling him 'too conservative' and 7% saying he’s 'too liberal,'"" the Register reports. Buttigieg still lags on the question of who can beat Trump: “For Buttigieg, the poll’s front-runner, just 27% of his own supporters say they are 'almost certain' he will beat Trump,” the Register reports.

Trouble ahead?: Buttigieg has frequently faced questions about his lack of support from black voters. A new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll reveals that weakness is still a problem. Of the national sample made up of early and Super Tuesday states just 13 percent of black respondents said they were considering supporting Buttigieg. Among African American voters, Biden was at 71 percent, Warren at 49 percent, Sanders at 41percent, Kamala Harris at 3 percent and Cory Booker at 20 percent.

TRUMP IS ""HEALTHY AS CAN BE"": ""White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said it is 'absolutely not' true that [Trump’s] visit to a doctor Saturday was anything other than a routine physical exam, maintaining that he is 'healthy as can be,'"" our colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Lenny Bernstein report.

More details: ""Trump, 73, made a visit Saturday afternoon to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. The trip came on a day when the president had no public events on his schedule ... For a typical annual physical exam, a patient would fast, usually overnight, so that accurate blood tests could be performed. The White House said that Trump was getting a jump on a portion of his physical and that lab work was included.""

Democratic presidential candidates jostle one another over health care, corporate power, climate change, inequality and much else as the House Intelligence Committee hears from career civil servants about the Republican incumbent’s effort to corrupt the very election these candidates are contesting.

Trump faces impeachment because of well-substantiated charges that the “favor” he asked of Ukraine’s president was to announce an investigation that would undermine one of those candidates, former vice president Joe Biden, who happens to be polling best in states most likely to swing the 2020 outcome.

Although Trump’s specific effort ultimately failed, he has already succeeded in his larger mission. Most informed voters now know that Biden’s son Hunter worked for a company that did business in Ukraine while Joe Biden was vice president. It is a classic Trumpian operation: Sow doubts about an opponent, dirty her or him up, and let the media — yes, that “corrupt liberal media” that Trump and his apologists love to denounce — do the rest.

The collateral human damage of Trump’s immorality was brought home during Friday’s testimony from Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She resisted Trump’s use of American power on behalf of his own political interests and was thus removed by the president, at the instigation of corrupt elements in Ukraine.

The 33-year State Department veteran not only lost her post, but now faces a separate smear campaign. Trump’s tweets denigrating her public service while she testified led committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to declare that “some of us here take witness intimidation very, very ­seriously.”

AD

AD

The shameful lack of decency from the man in the Oval Office would have been shocking from any other president, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that the tweet reflected how unsuited Trump is for the presidency altogether. “I think part of it is his own insecurity as an impostor,” she said. “I think he knows full well that he’s in that office way over his head.”

Now, move to the other screen. Ten Democratic presidential candidates will debate on Wednesday in Atlanta. Absent will be former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who joined the race last week, and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is flirting with entering. The odds against such latecomers are overwhelming. That they believe they have any chance at all reflects more than their ambition. They’re also spurred on by the Trump-induced chaos and the widespread sense that the nomination contest is in a state of flux.

Biden has been hurt by his own missteps and Trump’s efforts to besmirch him. But he still leads in national polls, and hangs on to his support among older voters, white and African American alike. He can also claim the risks the president has taken to undermine him as evidence of his electoral strength. Weekend polls showed South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging in Iowa, which will vote first in February. He can count on being the target of attacks from just about everyone else this week.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has had the best year of anyone, but her embrace of Medicare-for-all has led to the first serious challenges to her seemingly inexorable rise.

She sent a strong signal on Friday that she understood the water her campaign was taking on. By issuing a plan calling for a gradual transition to a new health-care system and emphasizing that she would begin her term by strengthening Obamacare with a public option and regulatory actions, she moved herself closer to Biden and Buttigieg on the issue. This is a much safer position for a general election campaign, but it will be seen as a retreat by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Medicare-for-all’s original champion, who has enjoyed a resurgence in the polls in recent weeks.

At one level, it’s a sign of the vitality of American politics that even as impeachment moves forward, at least one party is grappling with problems being left untended in the mayhem Trump has let loose.

AD

AD

Nonetheless, these candidates must remember the immediate priority of what’s happening on Screen One. The principal task between now and February is to help the country come to judgment about the president’s abuse of power and the dangers he poses to our republic.

Plans for health care and the economy matter enormously for the future, as Warren’s midcourse corrections demonstrate. But right now is the best opportunity these Democrats will have to show who is best positioned to prosecute the moral case against Donald Trump.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wants the federal government to mandate three months of paid family leave for workers. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to guarantee workers twice as long.

The issue is one of many separating the economic programs of the two 2020 presidential candidates vying to become the liberal standard-bearer. And where they diverge, Sanders mostly stakes out the more aggressive position.

That’s one of the revelations from The Post’s new survey of the candidates’ positions on economic issues as they prepare for their fifth debate, set for Wednesday and co-hosted by The Post.

Sanders stands alone on several issues.

He is the only candidate in the field, for example, to say the Federal Reserve’s interest rates are too high. “The Fed must become a more democratic institution that represents the needs of ordinary Americans and small businesses, not Wall Street billionaires,” he told The Post’s Kevin Uhrmacher. He said he “disagreed with the Fed’s decision to increase rates from 2015-2018. Raising rates should be done as a last resort, not to fight phantom inflation.”

Warren joined seven of her more moderate competitors — including former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — in declining to weigh in on monetary policy, saying the Fed should operate independently of political pressure. “The Fed’s mandate is to balance long-term price stability with full employment,” she said. “I respect the Fed’s independence in setting interest rates to achieve these two goals.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., at a fundraiser for the Nevada Democratic Party on Sunday. (AP Photo/John Locher)

Sanders is also the only contender to endorse a federal jobs guarantee, telling Uhrmacher that “in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, every American who wants to work should have the right to a decent-paying job through a federal jobs guarantee program.”

Warren said she’s open to it, pointing to her support for a proposal from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to launch a pilot program that would provide grants for jobs guarantee programs. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) noted she is a co-sponsor of Booker’s bill.

Sanders also wants to cancel all student debt and impose a national rent control cap — two more positions that make him unique in the field. Warren’s student debt plan wouldn’t offer relief to households pulling in more than $250,000, or the top 5 percent of earners. Booker, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro also propose offering relief based on household income.

Of course, Sanders and Warren line up elsewhere, notably on the broad strokes of tax policy. Both have proposed wealth taxes. And both favor returning the corporate tax rate to 35 percent, along with Buttigieg, Castro, and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Most of the rest of the field proposes raising it from its current 21 percent but leaving it lower than the old rate: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wants it at 25 percent; Bennet and Biden would lift it to 28 percent; Gov. Steve Bullock (D-Mont.) backs a 31 percent rate.

MARKET MOVERS

— Optimism powers stock rally. WSJ's Akane Otani: ""Stocks’ latest records are a testament to one thing: Investors aren’t worried about a recession happening soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 28,000 in the very last minute of Friday’s trading session, capping off an otherwise quiet week with its first thousand-point milestone since July.

""Much of the stock market’s dash higher in recent months has been powered by shares of economically sensitive companies like banks, manufacturers and oil producers. That rally, along with the relative underperformance of traditionally safe sectors like utilities and consumer staples, has suggested that money managers are turning more optimistic about the economic outlook.""

— Fed review finds stable financial system. CNBC's Jeff Cox: ""Stock market prices remain high compared to earnings, and corporations, including those at the bottom end of the credit spectrum, continue to run up debt. But financial stability overall remains solid, according to a report Friday from the Federal Reserve. The central bank’s biannual financial stability report also indicated that prices are high for commercial real estate and farmland. It also noted a few incidents where market liquidity deteriorated.

""In all, though, there are no areas identified as posing a threat to the larger stability of U.S. financial markets and the economy. In fact, the report found that the biggest threats come from abroad, through Brexit and other geopolitical risks.""

— FedEx eliminated its tax bill. The New York Times's Jim Tankersley, Peter Eavis and Ben Casselman: ""In the 2017 fiscal year, FedEx owed more than $1.5 billion in taxes. The next year, it owed nothing. What changed was the Trump administration’s tax cut — for which the company had lobbied hard... But it did not increase investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as [CEO Fred] Smith said businesses like his would.

""Nearly two years after the tax law passed, the windfall to corporations like FedEx is becoming clear. A New York Times analysis of data compiled by Capital IQ shows no statistically meaningful relationship between the size of the tax cut that companies and industries received and the investments they made. If anything, the companies that received the biggest tax cuts increased their capital investment by less, on average, than companies that got smaller cuts.""

FedEx's Smith responds. In a statement, Smith called the report ""distorted and factually incorrect"" but didn't say how. And he issued a challenge: ""I hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax.""

— Lighthizer’s moment of truth: “Like a more polished version of his freewheeling boss, [U.S. Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer has busted precedent, bent rules and left a trail of discomfited traditionalists in his wake. No constituency has been more unsettled than corporate America,” my colleague David J. Lynch reports.

“Now Lighthizer and the business community are awkward partners in a rush to seal two major prizes: a North American trade accord, which awaits lawmakers’ approval, and an unfinished deal with China.”

Look who’s on his call sheet: “In September alone, Lighthizer met or spoke by phone with the leaders of Apple, General Motors, Cisco, Dow, UPS, Boeing, Honeywell and Arcelor Mittal, as well as representatives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable, according to his office calendar on the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) website.”

“In September alone, Lighthizer met or spoke by phone with the leaders of Apple, General Motors, Cisco, Dow, UPS, Boeing, Honeywell and Arcelor Mittal, as well as representatives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable, according to his office calendar on the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) website.” But things are still uneasy: “But the stepped-up engagement has produced only an uneasy truce, with business groups remaining deeply skeptical of Lighthizer’s tariff-heavy strategy. ‘There are still points of friction,’ said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. ‘There are still major, major concerns about the direction of Trump’s trade policy.’ ”

— Morgan Stanley says trade tensions should ease in 2020: “Morgan Stanley forecasts that global growth will recover from the first quarter of 2020 onward as trade tensions and monetary policy ease, reversing the downward trend of the past seven quarters,” CNBC’s Spencer Kimball reports.

“‘Easing trade tensions (the key factor in the global downturn) will reduce business uncertainty and make policy stimulus more effective,’ the bank’s analysts said in its global outlook for 2020. The firm projects global economic growth of 3.2% next year, compared to 3% in 2019. Much depends, however, on the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks and whether or not the Trump administration’s next round of tariffs, scheduled for Dec. 15, go into effect. If those tariffs are activated, global growth in the final quarter of this year will slow to 2.8% and a recovery will be delayed until the third quarter of 2020, according to Morgan Stanley.”

“Apple CEO Tim Cook has been lauded for his relationship with Trump at a time when domestic manufacturing and the trade war with China could seriously harm Apple’s existing business model.

— HP board unanimously rejects Xerox’s bid: HP’s board of directors said “that they unanimously rejected a proposal from Xerox to acquire the company, because the offer is not in the best interest of shareholders and would undervalue HP,” CNBC’s Emma Newburger reports.

“Xerox had offered HP $22 per share in its takeover bid for the company. The bid consists of 77% cash and 23% stock, or $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox share for each HP share. HP announced in October that it will cut between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by the end of fiscal 2022 as part of a broader restructuring plan that it estimates will save $1 billion a year. The cuts would amount to nearly 16% of its 55,000 employees across the world, according to data from FactSet.”

— Saudis in race for IPO record: “Saudi Aramco is worth up to $1.7 trillion at the price range set by the oil giant on Sunday, below the $2 trillion sought by Saudi’s crown prince but putting it in the running to become the world’s biggest IPO,” Reuters’s Hadeel Al Sayegh, Saeed Azhar and Rania El Gamal report.

“Aramco cannot sell its shares directly to investors in the United States and other markets, as the initial public offering (IPO) will be restricted to Saudis and those foreign institutions permitted to invest in the kingdom’s stock market. The oil giant said it plans to sell 1.5% of the company, or about 3 billion shares, at an indicative price range of 30 riyals to 32 riyals, valuing the IPO at as much as 96 billion riyals ($25.6 billion) and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.”

— Warren, AOC side with Taylor Swift in fight against Carlyle Group: “Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a new ally in her battle against private equity: Taylor Swift,” CNBC’s Lauren Hirsch reports.

“Swift on Thursday wrote a Tumblr post in which she detailed her frustration over the terms of the sale of her back catalog to music managers Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta and private equity firm Carlyle Group. Swift, who protested the initial sale, claimed Braun and Borchetta’s company, Big Machine Label Group, is placing restrictions on her ability to play her older music on televised performances. She pleaded for support from her fans and let them know where they could direct their anger.”

And private equity punches back : “The private equity industry, under attack from [Warren], is defending itself with the Popeyes chicken sandwich,” Politico’s Zachary Warmbrodt reports. “The industry is touting the fast food craze as a success attributable to private equity-backed Popeyes as it tries to ward off a bipartisan Capitol Hill assault led by Warren, including legislation that would increase the firms’ liability for the companies they take over. The industry is also facing two congressional probes and a House hearing this week as lawmakers raise concerns about its impact on workers and consumers.”

""This hearing will provide a deluge of negative headlines for the entire private equity industry, but our sense is that the policy conversation is more political than practical at this stage.""

— The fight over the F-35: “The U.S. military’s most expensive weapons program seemed to be under threat from all sides at a recent hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, as skeptical lawmakers called out supply chain problems that have meant only a third of the Pentagon’s F-35 fighter jets are capable of carrying out all the missions for which they were built,” my colleague Aaron Gregg reports.

“And some lawmakers criticized the terms of Lockheed’s arrangement with the government, saying overly generous intellectual property agreements threaten to lock Lockheed into a wasteful long-term profit machine with limited accountability. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) threatened to hold up a multibillion-dollar contract if fundamental questions aren’t resolved, suggesting there should be a broader sea change in how military agencies work with weapons builders.”

The speech served as one of the clearest indicators yet that the billionaire businessman might soon join the crowded Democratic primary. Bloomberg has filed paperwork to run in Alabama and Arkansas and has mapped out a strategy that would largely bypass the four earliest nominating states. Instead, he would focus on later contests of note, including those in Southern states with large black populations.

AD

Bloomberg’s attempt to confront one of his biggest potential liabilities reflects the ongoing shift in the Democratic Party on issues of race, criminal justice and police violence. Voters and activists are increasingly demanding their leaders take firmer stances against discrimination by law enforcement and reject tough-on-crime policies that were more widely accepted decades ago.

This dynamic poses a challenge to older white candidates, such as former vice president Joe Biden, and it could create tough choices for many voters of color in the coming months. Biden and Bloomberg have complicated records on racial issues, with accomplishments lauded in minority communities and decisions panned in those same areas.

“I got something important wrong,” said Bloomberg, who grew visibly emotional at times during his speech. “I got something important really wrong.”

Biden performs well among black voters, polls show. Bloomberg is hoping to make his own inroads in coming months.

But it’s far from clear whether his apology, delivered in a highly controlled setting, will work. He gave his speech at the Christian Cultural Center, a familiar venue he had been to 17 times before, according to an aide. Bloomberg received a subdued round of applause at the end of the speech.

“Many people will see it as mixed,” said NAACP chief executive and President Derrick Johnson, speaking about Bloomberg’s record. Stop-and-frisk was “extremely problematic,” Johnson said, but, “at the exact same time, he’s been a strong supporter of gun reform and against gun violence. And that’s a positive thing.”

The Police Benevolent Association, New York’s largest police union, dismissed the apology as “too little, too late.” Patrick J. Lynch, the group’s president, said in a statement that officers had warned “that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities.”

Bloomberg’s potential candidacy and the way his record is perceived are surprise variables in a fluid Democratic race that has taken many twists and turns. Pete Buttigieg, a once-little-known mayor from South Bend, Ind., has surged to the lead in a new Iowa poll. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick just threw his hat into the ring. Biden has held his lead in many national polls. And Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have posted huge fundraising numbers that have boosted their chances.

From the start of 2002 until the end of 2013, Bloomberg served as mayor of the country’s most populous city, first as a Republican and later as an independent. During much of his tenure, the New York Police Department stepped up its use of stop-and-frisk. The most dramatic increases occurred during his first five years, according to department data analyzed by the New York Civil Liberties Union.

AD

Stop-and-frisk refers to the practice of police officers stopping, questioning and searching people they suspect may have committed crimes or are about to do so. The NYCLU analysis found that the stops disproportionately targeted young black and Latino men and that the vast majority did not result in arrests or summonses — a point Bloomberg acknowledged Sunday.

AD

“Far too many innocent people were being stopped,” he said. “And the overwhelming majority of them were black and Latino. That may have included, I’m sorry to say, some of you here today.”

“Perhaps yourself or your children or grandchildren, or your neighbors or your relatives,” he added.

AD

Bloomberg said repeatedly during his remarks that his focus was on saving lives. The NYCLU analysis, however, found that searches yielded weapons a small percentage of the time. A Washington Post analysis of data from the Brennan Center for Justice and the FBI found no correlation between stop-and-frisk and the reduction of violent crime in New York City.

In 2013, a federal judge ruled that the stop-and-frisk law was unconstitutional and said the city had engaged in indirect racial profiling. Bloomberg sought Sunday to underscore his efforts to reduce the number of stops before that time.

AD

During a sometimes pointed question-and-answer session at the Naval Academy in January, Bloomberg defended his record on stop-and-frisk, saying police “certainly” did not stop people based on their race.

AD

Bloomberg concluded his Sunday speech without making any firm commitments to running for president. “I don’t know what the future holds for me,” he said.

In the audience, Laruth Williams, 67, said Bloomberg’s apology was “surprising” and “sincere.” Lorna Lewis, 74, also said she felt he was sincere, but added, “I think he has to do a little bit more.”

Some associates and observers predict he will soon enter the race. Although his record is controversial, he is showing some signs of progress with African American leaders.

The Rev. Al Sharpton said he recently attended an Alabama state Baptist convention and found black support for Bloomberg. “Two or three ministers asked me about Bloomberg fairly positively,” he said. Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. met with Bloomberg and said he left a “great first impression.”

AD

AD

Still, he faces an imposing challenger in Biden, who has formed close ties with many African American leaders and has been outpacing his rivals among black voters in the polls.

Yet Biden has also faced scrutiny over his record on race, including his spearheading of a 1994 crime law that led to increased incarceration levels as well as his controversial comments about a segregationist senator and busing.

Asked if he could support a Bloomberg presidential bid, Sharpton said he was still undecided but that he would ultimately have to consider Bloomberg’s record on stop-and-frisk against the records of “candidates that supported the crime bill that was devastating,” a reference to votes by Biden and Sanders for the 1994 law.

AD

Bloomberg’s aggressive and well-funded initiative to tighten gun laws and elect members of Congress committed to placing new regulations on firearms could help boost his appeal to African American leaders and voters.

That doesn’t mean they will soon forget stop-and-frisk.

“Like any candidate offering themselves up for public office, we’re always going to have good and bad,” Johnson said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was the final presidential candidate fully on board with a swift and complete Medicare-for-all overhaul of the U.S. health-care system.

No longer.

Like the other Democratic contenders, Warren has somewhat softened her position on the sweeping — and what some term radical — Medicare-for-all system envisioned by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). On Friday she released a proposal to first adopt a public option approach similar to what the race’s moderates are calling for — a marked shift from her previous calls for quickly moving all Americans to government-backed health insurance.

Warren introduced her proposal this way:

As president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and will protect people with pre-existing conditions. And in my first 100 days, I’ll take executive and legislative action to reduce health care costs and improve coverage. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

Next, in my first 100 days, I’ll use the same process Mitch McConnell used to try and kill the ACA to bypass the filibuster and create a true #MedicareForAll option—more generous than one proposed by any other campaign—to begin the transition to #MedicareForAll. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

This #MedicareForAll option will be open to everyone and includes all the health care benefits of #MedicareForAll. It will be immediately free for nearly half of all Americans, including all children under 18 and anyone with income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

By the end of my third year, I’ll fight to pass legislation to complete the transition to #MedicareForAll. Once millions have experienced the full benefits of a #MedicareforAll option and compared it to the corrupt and wasteful system we have today, the people will demand it. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

This latest Warren health-care proposal comes ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday, which could bring more politically tricky discussions of how to expand health insurance to around 30 million people who still lack it. Democrats spent considerable time in past debates wrangling over the pros and cons of a single-payer approach of uprooting existing coverage and raising taxes in the interest of ensuring everyone has a comprehensive and affordable set of benefits.

Many of the candidates started their campaigns enthusiastically backing the Sanders bill, which would replace all private health coverage with a generous public plan over a four-year transition period. But one by one they’ve qualified their support, releasing proposals to preserve a role for private coverage or private insurers to ensure people don’t get involuntarily dropped from plans they might want to keep.

Warren was the lone candidate to still support the Sanders plan without any qualifications. But now she’s tacitly acknowledging Medicare-for-all’s political difficulty by proposing that people should be allowed — but not forced — to enroll in government health insurance as a first step toward universal health coverage.

Under her proposal published Friday in a Medium post, Warren says in her presidency’s first 100 days she would push Congress to expand Medicare to people age 50 and older and create a Medicare-type plan anyone else could buy, subsidized more heavily than the private plans available in the Obamacare marketplaces. Democrats would have to win a majority in the Senate so they could use the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to bypass Republican support.

“By the end of my first 100 days, we will have opened the door for tens of millions of Americans to get high-quality Medicare for All coverage at little or no cost,” Warren wrote.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), sponsor of the House Medicare-for-all bill:

.@ewarren's transition plan reaffirms her commitment to the four-year transition plan outlined in the Senate #MedicareForAll Bill. It lays out how she'd use exec & administrative authority to take on for-profit insurers & begin providing relief to the American people on Day 1. — Pramila Jayapal (@PramilaJayapal) November 15, 2019

Activist Ady Barkan, who has testifed before Congress in favor of Medicare-for-all, praised Warren:

Today,@ewarren laid out a plan to get 100 million ppl onto Medicare in first 100 days, via exec action & 51-vote reconciliation. And to use that victory to win midterms & show America that M4A is a great workable.



It's a damn smart plan. And by now, that should surprise no one. — Ady Barkan🔥🌹 (@AdyBarkan) November 15, 2019

A self-described Sanders supporter wasn't so enthused:

She lied about being ""with Bernie"" on HC.



A Medicare Buy-In Public Option is NOT #MedicareForAll.



It's a fast-lane/slow-lane, two-tiered HC system for R's and Big $ to attack for 3 years before she even plans to fight.

New Republic's Libby Watson:

this warren thing is gonna rip the medicare for all movement apart. this sucks — guy fieri 2020 campaign manager (@libbycwatson) November 15, 2019

Warren insists she’d pass Medicare-for-all in the third year of her presidency. But there’s reason to believe this could be even more unlikely than if she pushed for it right out of the gate (and passing it immediately would already be a tall order, if Republicans retain control of the Senate in 2020).

For one thing, getting more Americans covered via incremental methods – like a public option – would reduce the population of uninsured people and therefore the urgency for passing something as drastic as Medicare-for-all. That's a point made by hard-left provider groups that have enthusiastically backed Medicare-for-all. Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program, told my colleague Annie Linskey that a two-step approach could halt momentum for Medicare-for-all and even torpedo it.

“Doing this in stages creates a political danger and an opening for opponents to prevent further progress,” Gaffney said. “The longer the rollout, the more political risk.”

And consider this. The president’s political party typically loses seats during midterm elections – meaning Warren would likely have even fewer Democrats in Congress to help her pass Medicare-for-all during her third year in office.

“It’s a clear shift for the senator from Massachusetts as she attempts to ward off criticism that her single-payer health plan is unrealistic substantively and toxic politically,” Annie writes. “Warren for months had signaled a full-throated embrace of Medicare-for-all, and this new approach significantly tempers that urgency.”

Other candidates have also taken detours from the Medicare-for-all highway. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wants to preserve a role for private insurance companies to sell Medicare plans to everyone. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg wants to let anyone buy into Medicare without unraveling the system of employer-sponsored coverage – an approach that looks remarkably similar to what former vice president Joe Biden has proposed.

In short, each of the top Democratic candidates now has his or her own, nuanced proposal for reaching universal health coverage. And as the primaries approach, they’re increasing beating each other up over those differences. Warren was on the receiving end over the weekend.

“Having discovered how problematic her embrace of Medicare-for-all has become….Senator Warren is now trying to muddy the waters even further,” said Kate Bedingfield, communications director for former vice president Joe Biden.

Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) said she was “backtracking.” Buttigieg spokeswoman Lis Smith accused her of trying to “paper over a very serious policy problem.”

Sanders didn't directly criticize Warren's proposal, but his campaign did tweet a statement from National Nurses United, which is pushing for Medicare-for-all and has endorsed him:

""We know that there are ample opportunities for politicians to compromise on Medicare for All, and we know, having worked with Senator Sanders before, that he won't compromise when people's health is at stake."" –Deborah Burger, Co-President @NationalNurses pic.twitter.com/YlBfQD89iM — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 15, 2019

Comments from former President Barack Obama, via the New York Times's Lisa Lerer:

Obama's comments were meant to reassure establishment Democrats about the strength of the field. But they also offered an implicit critique of Sanders & Warren, as well as proposals once widely considered to be left to the liberal fringes of the party. https://t.co/bbjPvWl4Yr — Lisa Lerer (@llerer) November 16, 2019

Sanders also appeared to indirectly contrast his approach with Warren's by adding a line to his stump speech yesterday, Annie reports.

“Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all ­single-payer legislation,” he said Saturday in East Los Angeles.

Warren is likely to face many questions during Wednesday’s debate about her tempered new approach. In response to reporter questions over the weekend, she rejected the idea that her proposal acknowledges single-payer health care isn’t feasible in the United State.

“I don’t see it that way at all,” Warren said. “The way I see this, is that there is an intense need right now for relief.”

But here's an intense need for Warren: To seize back support from Iowa caucusgoers. While Warren led the Iowa polls in September, a new poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN released Saturday night showed her in a three-way tie for second place with Biden and Sanders, while Buttigieg surged ahead of the pack. The poll shows Buttigieg with 25 percent support and Warren, Biden and Sanders all with about 15 percent support.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

AHH: President Trump has backed off of a ban on most flavored e-cigarettes, worried about the consequences such as lost jobs and angry shop owners and customers that could hurt his 2020 reelection bid.

The ban had already been cleared by federal regulators, and a Nov. 5 morning news conference was planned. But the night before, Trump refused to sign a “decision memo,” our Post colleagues Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley report.

A senior administration official told them the president “didn’t know much about the issue” and that he’d been pushing for it because of Melania and Ivanka Trump, who were urging him to take action on the issue.

“As he had done so many times before, Trump reversed course — this time on a plan to address a major public health problem because of worries that apoplectic vape shop owners and their customers might hurt his reelection prospects, said White House and campaign officials,” they write. “He also believed job losses tied to the ban would cost him as he sought to trumpet economic growth. It was the latest example of the chaotic way policy is made — and sometimes unmade — in a White House where the ultimate decider often switches gears after making a controversial vow, whether on combating gun violence, pulling troops from Syria or promising to deliver an Obamacare replacement plan.”

Trump had been rattled by the blowback to the possible ban, and the president was now upset with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who had taken a lead on the plan.

Now, it’s unclear whether a policy will be unveiled at all.

OOF: The Trump administration announced a rule mandating that hospitals publicly disclose the discounted rates they negotiated privately with insurers. It’s a rule that was “resisted for months by a broad swath of the health-care industry, hospitals,” our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.

The requirement, which will go into effect in January 2021, means that hospitals will have to reveal rates for hundreds of services that can be scheduled in advance, including X-rays and Caesarean sections.

“For decades, hospitals, insurance companies, lobbyists, and special interests have hidden prices from consumers so they could drive up costs for you. And you had no idea what was happening. You’d get bills that were unbelievable and you have no idea why,” Trump said in Friday remarks at the White House.

The administration has been expecting a legal challenge to the rule from the hospital industry — and the two biggest hospital trade groups, the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals, said they will challenge it.

“In a new twist, the administration is also proposing to require most health plans that Americans get through their jobs to disclose the rates they negotiate with hospitals and doctors in their insurance networks, as well as the amounts they pay to doctors out-of-network,” Amy writes. “…Taken together, the pair of actions — one a final rule, the other in draft form — is part of President Trump’s 2020 electoral strategy to capi­tal­ize on polls that show health care ranks among Americans’ top domestic concerns. Public opinion surveys consistently show that consumers are looking to government especially to ease the burden of escalating out-of-pocket costs.”

OUCH: Researchers have found that invasive heart procedures such as stent insertions and bypass surgery are no more effective for individuals with stable heart disease than drugs.

But the study did find that such procedures were “measurably” better than pills at reducing chest pain during exercise, our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.

The closely anticipated federally funded study results “suggest that invasive procedures, stents and bypass surgery, should be used more sparingly in patients with stable heart disease and the decision to use them should be less rushed, experts said.”

“The ISCHEMIA trial shows that an early invasive approach does not protect patients against death or the overall chance of a heart attack, but does effectively relieve chest pain — the more chest pain a patient has, the more likely they are to benefit,” said Elliott Antman, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who was not involved in the research.

“The new study was designed to finally settle the question of whether stents are better for patients with stable heart disease — and some physicians said it could change how tens of thousands of people are treated in hospitals, transform how cardiologists talk with patients about their options and save hundreds of millions of dollars in health-care spending each year,” Carolyn writes.

MEDICAL MISSIVES

—Telemedicine centers are filling a gap left by the shrinking availability of hospitals and doctors in rural areas across the country, where choices are sometimes between having a doctor help you from a screen or not at all.

One center, Avera eCare, provides remote care for 179 hospitals in 30 states. But they’re operating out of cubicles. “They wear scrubs to look the part of traditional doctors on camera, even though they never directly see or touch their patients,” our Post colleague Eli Saslow writes in this deeply reported piece. “They respond to more than 15,000 emergencies each year by using remote-controlled cameras and computer screens at what has become rural America’s busiest emergency room, which is in fact a virtual ER located in a suburban industrial park.”

Emergency telemedicine is increasing in the poorest, sickest and most remote regions in the United States, as ER patients have spiked by 60 percent in the past decade in rural areas, and the number of physicians and hospitals in those areas has decreased by up to 15 percent.

“In less than a decade, the virtual hospital has grown from a few part-time employees working out of a converted storage room into one of the country’s most dynamic 24-hour ERs, where a rural health-care crisis plays out on screen,” Eli writes. “Each month the monitors show an average of 300 cardiac episodes, 200 traumatic injuries, 80 overdoses and 25 burns. There are patients suffering from heat stroke in South Texas and frostbite in Minnesota — sometimes on the same day. There are drowning deaths in summer, gunshot wounds during hunting season, car accidents on icy roads, and snakebites in spring.”

— Two out of three Americans say marijuana use should be legal, the Pew Research Center has found.

The survey data shows just 8 percent say it should not be legal at all, down from the 15 percent who said it should be completely illegal in 2016, our Post colleague Christopher Ingraham reports.

The Pew survey found 78 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Republicans support legalization. It also found 59 percent of Americans say it should be legal for both medical and recreational use, and 32 percent said it should be legal just for medical use.

“As with many political issues, the public’s preferences on marijuana are well to the left of where the policy currently stands,” Christopher writes. “The plant remains illegal for all purposes under federal law. Recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states plus D.C., in most cases because of voter-approved ballot initiatives. Most other states have some form of medical marijuana law, although in many cases there are severe restrictions on the conditions for which medical marijuana can be used, or on the types of marijuana that can be used.”

INDUSTRY RX

— Most of the advertisements spreading false information about vaccines on Facebook were funded by two groups, including the World Mercury Project, a group led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports.

“Researchers said the results surprised them. Much of the anti-vaccine content posted on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter may appear to be organic, grass-roots discussions led by neighborhood groups and concerned parents, said David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University and one of the authors of the study,” Lena writes. “…The study was conducted before Facebook changed its policies around anti-vaccine advertising, but researchers said it provides a look at how the platform has been used to spread misinformation.”

False claims have spread online and social platforms in recent years as more parents delay or otherwise choose not to get their children vaccinated. Kennedy’s World Mercury Project has pushed the false message that “vaccines are contributing to a vast array of childhood illnesses.”

Of the ads assessed for the research, there were 145 that were anti-vaccine and 83 groups that promoted them. The study found “five groups accounted for 75 percent of anti-vaccine messages. The top two were the World Mercury Project and Stop Mandatory Vaccination.” Stop Mandatory Vaccination is led by Larry Cook, who calls himself an “advocate for natural living.”

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: President Trump is spurning the women who have his ear to side with male advisers as he kowtows to a pressure campaign orchestrated by corporate interests.

Perhaps the most effective path to persuade Trump to change his mind on public policy is to convince him that he would lose support from his base, whether it’s true or not. This is how the National Rifle Association, which should be viewed first and foremost as a trade association for the gun industry, got him to break his promise to impose “very meaningful background checks” for gun purchases after the massacres in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.

This same dynamic helps explain why the president has backed away from the crackdown he announced two months ago on most flavored e-cigarettes. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Sept. 11 that first lady Melania Trump feels “very, very strongly” that government must quell the youth vaping epidemic that has ensnared 5 million teenagers. “She’s got a son,” Trump said, referring to his wife. (Barron, 13, is his son, too.) “We can’t allow people to get sick, and we can’t have our youth be so affected,” the president added.

Trump was also pressed to act by his daughter Ivanka Trump, a senior adviser in the White House, and encouraged by Kellyanne Conway, the most powerful woman in the administration who is not a member of the president’s family. Conway, who managed Trump’s 2016 campaign in the home stretch after Paul Manafort was pushed out over his sketchy financial dealings in Ukraine, argued that doing something about flavored e-cigs could enable the president to regain ground he’s lost among suburban moms who have traditionally voted Republican.

But on Nov. 4, the night before details of the ban were all set to be formally unveiled during a news conference, the president balked. My colleagues Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley scoop that Trump refused to sign a one-page decision memo during a flight to a campaign rally in Kentucky that would have taken candy, fruit and mint flavors off the market within 30 days. Three officials familiar with the discussions said that Trump has grown upset with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who took the lead in rolling out a plan to address the vaping crisis. “He didn’t know much about the issue and was just doing it for Melania and Ivanka,” a senior administration official explained.

“Late last week, more than a dozen White House officials met to try to find a way forward,” Josh and Laurie report. “Given Trump’s record of zigzags, some officials cautioned the president could reverse course again. Or he might back some ban on flavored e-cigarettes that exempts vape shops. Others said the White House might pursue a different tack altogether by endorsing legislation that would raise the minimum federal age for buying tobacco products to 21 from 18 … Some bet the anti-vaping effort is dead, though, especially because the administration could argue the youth vaping problem has been greatly eased by Juul Labs’ recent decision to stop selling its popular mint-flavored nicotine pods. ‘It’s going to go the way of guns,’ predicted one adviser…”

The president changed his mind after he was warned repeatedly that banning flavored e-cigarettes would anger vaping enthusiasts and could depress turnout for him in the 2020 election. Trump’s reelection campaign manager Brad Parscale told the president that moving against flavored e-cigarettes could backfire with his base. “A Washington Examiner op-ed written by a pro-vaping conservative activist, Paul Blair, with the headline ‘Banning flavored e-cigarettes might cost Trump reelection,’ was circulated at the White House and considered the ‘opinion of the campaign,’ according to a White House official involved in the process,” Michael Scherer, Josh, Laurie and Neena Satija reported last month. “Trump advisers [in the White House] compiled a binder of evidence supporting the idea of strong new measures to combat youth vaping, according to a person familiar with the effort. The documents included public polling, supportive editorials, statements from the scientific and medical community, and statements from elected leaders.”

It’s unclear if Trump read that binder. But Trump’s helicopter flew over hundreds of people who gathered on the Ellipse to protest his flavor ban when he departed the White House on Nov. 9 to watch the Alabama-LSU football game. He also saw a pro-vaping protest outside his rally in Dallas last month. And there was a social media campaign that used the hashtag #IVapeIVote. This effort has included many hallmarks of what’s known as an “Astroturf” campaign.

-- Many former Trump aides have been cashing in on the industry’s panic. Juul has been paying Trump world insiders like Josh Raffel, a former spokesman for Jared Kushner; Johnny DeStefano, a former counselor to the president; and Rebeccah Propp, former director of media affairs for Vice President Pence. Brian Ballard, the Florida lobbyist who represented Trump’s businesses there and worked on the president’s 2016 campaign, has been paid seven figures by Reynolds American, which owns an e-cigarette company. Jeff Miller, a lobbyist with close ties to Pence, reported that his firm was paid $60,000 by Altria from July through September 2019 to lobby on the executive branch on issues related to the regulation of tobacco products, including “WH Administration Initiative to ban flavored vaping products.”

Conservative activist Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, has played a starring role in ginning up opposition to the implementation of what Trump announced, but he’s declined to say whether he or his group have received money from the e-cigarette industry.

-- The bigger picture: Trump continues to campaign like a populist even as he governs like a plutocrat, and the republic continues its descent toward corporatocracy. In 2016, he promised to be a different kind of Republican and said he’d check corporate power. He said he was incorruptible because he was so rich that he didn’t need to take campaign contributions. Among other things, Trump said he would end the carried interest loophole and go after hedge funds. In practice, he’s done the opposite.

The president’s signature legislative achievement was the tax cut bill in 2017, which has proven to be even more of a giveaway for the rich than analysts feared while exploding the national debt. A damning story on the front of Sunday’s New York Times highlighted how FedEx – which spent $10 million on lobbying that year, mostly on tax policy – went from owing $1.5 billion in taxes to nothing the following year. But the shipping company did not increase total investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as its chief executive Fred Smith said companies would do if they got the lower corporate rate. Instead, the story explained, FedEx used its windfall to reward shareholders with more than $2 billion in stock buybacks and dividend increases. Smith called the story an “outrageous distortion of the truth” and challenged the publisher of the Times to a debate on federal tax policy, but he did not specify any errors.

-- Four were killed and six were injured during a shooting at a backyard football-viewing party in Fresno, Calif. Katie Shepherd reports: “Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley told reporters near the scene that officers arrived to find ‘several individuals’ dead on the back lawn. Unknown suspects fled before police arrived at the home, shortly after 8 p.m. Sunday evening ... All the victims were ‘Asian males’ between 25 and 35 years old, Fresno Police Deputy Chief Michael Reid told the Bee. ‘Thank God that no kids were hurt,’ Reid said, the Associated Press reported. Police declined to discuss what kind of weapon was used or any potential motive.""

IMPEACHMENT LATEST:

-- Trump tweeted this morning that he will “strongly consider” testifying in writing as part of the impeachment inquiry. The president said he might take up House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on a suggestion she made over the weekend on CBS. Trump also claimed the rules of the inquiry had been “rigged” against him by Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who has summoned four witnesses to appear before his panel on Tuesday. “Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” Trump said in tweets that described Pelosi as “Nervous Nancy” and “crazy.” (Follow our liveblog for more updates throughout the day.)

-- Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Trump administration officials who provided information to the anonymous whistleblower about the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine “exposed things that didn’t need to be exposed.” Felicia Sonmez, Karoun Demirjian and Douglas MacMillan report: “‘This would have been far better off if we would’ve just taken care of this behind the scenes,’ Johnson said in an interview on NBC News’s ‘Meet the Press.’ ... 'We were trying to convince President Trump.’ … Trump on Sunday continued to take aim at his own administration officials, accusing Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe and Russia, of being a ‘Never Trumper.’ … Williams is expected to testify publicly on Tuesday. Her closed-door testimony, which was released Saturday, suggests that the Office of Management and Budget had clamped down on Ukraine aid more than two weeks earlier than has been previously reported. …

“The comments by Trump and Johnson also come amid intensifying scrutiny of the actions of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, [who is expected to testify on Wednesday and one of eight people scheduled to appear in public hearings this week]. According to testimony released Saturday, a former White House national security official told House investigators that Sondland was acting at Trump’s behest and spoke to a top Ukrainian official about exchanging military aid for political investigations — two elements at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he believes Sondland will face pressure this week when he’s asked about inconsistencies between his testimony and that of other recent witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. …

""On ‘Fox News Sunday,’ House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) dismissed the witnesses who have testified, ... arguing that ‘they were not all Trump administration folks.’ ‘They’re Schiff’s witnesses,’ Scalise said. … When pressed by host Chris Wallace on the fact that most of the witnesses are part of the Trump administration, Scalise responded that ‘there are a lot of people who worked in the Trump administration who have very countering views to that and they’ve not been allowed to come forward.’ ... In an interview with CBS News’s ‘Face the Nation’ ... Pelosi declined to weigh in on the timeline for a potential impeachment vote, saying only that there may be further depositions over the Thanksgiving holiday and that there may be ‘a decision or maybe they have more hearings’ once Congress returns.”

-- Tim Morrison, the former top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council, testified that it was his understanding Sondland spoke to Trump directly about half a dozen times between July 16 and Sept. 11. Trump has increasingly tried to distance himself from Sondland. During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said Morrison’s testimony is ""alarming.” From CNN: “‘Well, of course, all of that is alarming. As I've said from the beginning, I think this is not OK. The President of the United States shouldn't even in the original phone call be on the phone with the president of another country and raise his political opponent,’ [Turner said]. … Turner also addressed tweets Trump posted last week during former Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch's public testimony before the panel. … ‘It's certainly not impeachable, and it's certainly not criminal and it's certainly not witness intimidation. It certainly wasn't trying to prevent her or wouldn't have prevented her from testifying, she was actually in the process of testifying. But nonetheless, I find the President's tweets unfortunate,’ the congressman said.”

-- Sondland kept several Trump administration officials apprised of his effort to get Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens, including Mick Mulvaney and Rick Perry, according to emails obtained by the Wall Street Journal: “The emails reviewed by the Journal show that three days [after the July 10 meeting], Mr. Sondland urged Mr. Morrison to schedule the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky before Ukrainian parliamentary elections on July 21. ‘Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give Potus assurances of ""new sheriff"" in town. Corruption ending, unbundling moving forward and any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently,’ Mr. Sondland wrote. Mr. Morrison replied that he was ‘tracking.’ On July 19, a day before the president was initially scheduled to speak to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Sondland emailed a group of administration officials including Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Perry to say that Mr. Zelensky was prepared to assure the president that he would open investigations. ‘I talked to Zelensky just now. He is prepared to receive Potus’ call,’ Mr. Sondland wrote. ‘Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will ""turn over every stone.""’ He added that Mr. Zelensky was eager for the call to take place before the parliamentary elections. Mr. Mulvaney responded: ‘I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.’”

-- When Sondland stepped in to mediate, things really went off the rails. From the Daily Beast: “Ukrainian officials arrived at the White House on July 10 expecting something approaching normal. They were in Washington for a scheduled meeting with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton with a plan to propose a new path for U.S.-Ukrainian relations under the umbrella of energy and security cooperation. All seemed to go well—until [Sondland] stepped in. ‘That’s when things really went off the rails,’ one person in the room said. … Sondland raised his voice several times in his attempt to persuade the Ukrainian officials sitting across from him, including Andriy Yermak, a close aide to Zelensky, and Zelensky’s then-national security adviser Oleksandr Danylyuk. One individual told The Daily Beast that Sondland ‘got very emotional,’ adding that ‘there was lots of yelling.’ Another individual called the meeting ‘erratic’ and said the Ukrainians began to ignore Sondland and instead turned to Fiona Hill, who ran the National Security Council’s Russia desk at the time, for clarification on Washington’s messaging. Sondland has previously tried to claim he didn’t know much about a quid pro quo with Ukraine—until he suddenly told Congress he now recalls the deal. But the details of Sondland’s behavior in the Ward Room underscore the intensity in which the EU Ambassador advocated for the investigations into [Joe] Biden and Burisma.”

-- An overwhelming 70 percent of Americans think Trump’s request to a foreign leader to investigate Biden was wrong, an ABC News/Ipsos poll found

-- Trump’s public schedule for this week seems designed to keep him distracted from the televised hearings as much as possible. From Axios: “Trump's schedule for the coming week shows him governing, promoting U.S. jobs and highlighting the arts and pop culture. On Tuesday, as Democrats question Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Trump will be meeting with his Cabinet. On Wednesday, as Democrats grill [Sondland], Trump will he visiting Apple's manufacturing plant in Texas. And on Thursday, after Democrats question [Hill], Trump will be presenting the national medals of arts and humanities.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Hundreds of leaked Iranian intelligence reports offer a detailed portrait of how aggressively Tehran has worked to embed itself into Iraqi affairs and the unique role of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force. From the Times and the Intercept: “The unprecedented leak exposes Tehran’s vast influence in Iraq, detailing years of painstaking work by Iranian spies to co-opt the country’s leaders, pay Iraqi agents working for the Americans to switch sides and infiltrate every aspect of Iraq’s political, economic and religious life. Many of the cables describe real-life espionage capers that feel torn from the pages of a spy thriller. Meetings are arranged in dark alleyways and shopping malls or under the cover of a hunting excursion or a birthday party. Informants lurk at the Baghdad airport, snapping pictures of American soldiers and keeping tabs on coalition military flights. Agents drive meandering routes to meetings to evade surveillance. Sources are plied with gifts of pistachios, cologne and saffron. Iraqi officials, if necessary, are offered bribes. …

“The leaked cables ... detail the extent to which Iraq has fallen under Iranian influence since the American invasion in 2003, which transformed Iraq into a gateway for Iranian power, connecting the Islamic Republic’s geography of dominance from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. … Many of Iraq’s foremost political, military, and security officials have had secret relationships with Tehran, according to the documents. … According to the reports, after the American troop withdrawal in 2011, Iran moved quickly to add former C.I.A. informants to its payroll. … In interviews, Iranian officials acknowledged that Iran viewed surveillance of American activity in Iraq after the United States invasion as critical to its survival and national security. … The roughly 700 pages of leaked reports were sent anonymously to The Intercept, which translated them from Persian to English and shared them with The Times. … The Intercept communicated over encrypted channels with the source, who declined to meet with a reporter. In these anonymous messages, the source said that they wanted to ‘let the world know what Iran is doing in my country Iraq.’”

-- Protests in Iran continued after the country’s supreme leader endorsed a government decision to cut fuel subsidies and warned demonstrators against clashing with security forces. Erin Cunningham reports: “In a televised address, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he supports the measure to push up gasoline prices and ration supplies, a move designed to raise funds for cash handouts to the poor. The abrupt decision, announced Friday, sparked demonstrations in about two dozen locations across the country as residents already grappling with soaring inflation called on the government to reverse the hike. In towns and cities across Iran, drivers abandoned vehicles on highways and protesters blocked roads and set tires and buildings alight. Some demonstrators clashed with baton-wielding security forces, officials said, and at least one protester and a police officer were killed.""

-- Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong were surrounded by riot police this morning inside a university campus, setting the stage for a bloody fight. Casey Quackenbush, Anna Kam, Gerry Shih and Tiffany Liang report: “Police blocked exits to try to coax exhausted protesters out of the Polytechnic University on Monday after a night of clashes with students. When some attempted to leave, officers forced them back with tear gas and rubber bullets and made dozens of arrests. As night fell, and with explosions and black smoke emanating from the grounds, police repeated demands for the demonstrators — some of whom have been there for days — to surrender. At rallies across the city, people expressed support for the trapped students. … Some 500 to 600 students remain trapped, said Derek Liu, head of the university’s student union. PolyU’s president, Jin-Guang Teng, in a video statement urged students to hand themselves in. …

""In a new setback for [Hong Kong leader Carrie] Lam, Hong Kong’s highest court ruled Monday that the government’s use of a British colonial-era emergency ordinance to ban face coverings at public gatherings was unconstitutional. Lam had introduced the measure to aid police in identifying protesters and effectively expand powers of arrest. Lam visited an injured police officer in the hospital on Monday, but she did not make public remarks, and her office did not respond to a request for comment. In a message on Facebook later, she condemned protesters and urged them to obey police.”

-- Uighur activists called the leaked Chinese documents revealing the government’s plan to systematically detain millions of ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region another form of genocide. Lateshia Beachum reports: “The more than 400 pages of documents, leaked, according to the Times, by a member of the Chinese political establishment, included internal speeches by President Xi Jinping and other officials, information about the surveillance and control of the Uighur population and internal investigations on local officials. … The papers confirm reports that more than 1 million people have been detained in internment camps as the Chinese government seeks to strip Uighurs of their identity and indoctrinate them into being secular and loyal party supporters. Xi still told party members in secret speeches that religious extremists should be treated with ‘absolutely no mercy,’ the Times reported. The documents included a script for officials to follow when explaining to students returning to the region why their parents had disappeared, the Times reported. The World Uyghur Congress called China a ‘country with concentration camps’ in a retweet.”

-- Few Uighurs have been able to escape the widespread surveillance, and even fewer are able to make it to the U.S. in search of asylum. Now, an Uighur family living in Northern Virginia has caught the attention of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Emily Rauhala and Anna Fifield report: “Zumrat Dawut, her husband, Imran Muhammad, and their three children got out. Dawut, who survived internment and an unwanted sterilization, fled first with her family to her husband’s native Pakistan. The next leg of their journey took them to a basement apartment in Virginia outside Washington. They spent their first American summer strolling through shopping malls and savoring Popeyes’ halal fried chicken. ‘Here in U.S., people have human rights. People live like real human beings,’ Dawut said. They have applied for asylum in the United States. They want, desperately, to stay. But their case — which recently caught [Pompeo’s] attention — raises tough questions for the Trump administration as it vows to take a harder line on China while simultaneously seeking a trade deal with Beijing. The United States has roundly condemned the internment camps in Xinjiang. But will it take in those who endured Beijing’s chokehold on the region and somehow reached the United States?”

-- Russian troops took command of a U.S. air base in northern Syria. From CBS News: “The Russians are playing up the takeover of the Kobani airfield as a victory. The former U.S. airbase that served as the main logistical hub for America's fight against ISIS, now with the Russian flag flying above it. The Russians moved in just a day after U.S. forces moved out, leaving behind barracks, beds, abandoned medical supplies and the skeleton of a gym with weights removed, to render it useless. The same can't be said of the runway, however. An American-made landing strip now under Russian management. It's the second major military expansion in this region in as many days, after Russia announced it had opened up a new helicopter base in Qamishli, which, like Kobani, is also on the Turkish border.”

-- A planned prisoner swap between the Afghan government and the Taliban meant to restart peace talks between the insurgent group and the U.S. has been delayed. Susannah George reports: “The emergence of significant snags early on highlights the difficulty of getting the two sides back to the negotiating table. The Taliban has long refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government. The swap would have freed two university professors in exchange for three high-profile militants linked to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani announced the deal on live television last week, saying it would help bring ‘peace and stability’ to Afghanistan ... But days after Ghani’s announcement, none of the prisoners have been released and the government and Taliban officials are trading blame. Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Ghani, blamed the Taliban for the delay, tweeting Saturday that the insurgents ‘failed to observe the conditions’ of the swap and caused ‘the disruption of the exchange process.’ He did not elaborate.”

-- Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced the U.S. and South Korea postponed a joint military exercise, bowing to saber-rattling by North Korea. From the AP: “The move comes even as Japan’s defense minister, whose country feels threatened by repeated North Korean missile launches, told Esper ‘no one could be optimistic about’ changing the North’s behavior. … Esper insisted the postponement was not a concession to North Korea but rather an attempt to ‘keep the door open’ to diplomacy to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons.”

-- North Korea responded to a tweet by Trump that hinted at another summit with Kim Jong Un by saying it has no interest in giving Trump further meetings unless it gets something in return. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan said Washington must discard what his government sees as “hostile” policies in order to keep negotiations alive. (AP)

-- While Trump stands by, the world’s tyrants are trying to make the world safe for dictatorship, warns The Post’s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt: “The United States is retreating, almost apologizing for ever having thought about promoting democracy. Everyone from Rand Paul to Bernie Sanders and many in between agrees we should stay home and mind our business. But the result is not a world in which every country is free to go its own way. Instead, the world’s tyrants — while still complaining about color revolutions and U.S. interference — roam far and wide, promoting their ideologies and their corporations, bullying and buying and burrowing and shooting their way to influence. Russia and China, the loudest conjurers of imaginary CIA pro-democracy plots, have become the world’s most active underminers of democracy beyond their borders.”

-- Last year, after CIA Director Gina Haspel was nominated for her position, White House counsel Don McGahn suggested she withdraw due to her role in the “enhanced interrogation” program, which he argued could kill her confirmation chances. Trump disagreed, telling advisers that he supports ""torture."" From Axios: “Trump actually liked this aspect of Haspel's resume, according to three sources who spoke to the president at the time. In fact, Trump told aides that Haspel's support for ‘torture’ or ‘waterboarding’ (Trump uses these words interchangeably in his private conversations) was an asset, not a liability. Trump told advisers that he asked Haspel her opinion on whether waterboarding works. In Trump's telling, Haspel replied to him that she was ‘100%’ sure it works, a source who spoke to Trump about it told me. ‘He seemed impressed with how sure she was about something so controversial,’ the source said. ‘That she did not bat an eye, did not sugarcoat it, that it works.’”

-- Friday news dump follow-up: “Trump sides with war criminals,” Kori Schake, a veteran of George W. Bush's national security team, writes in the Atlantic: “Trump has exercised his authority to intervene in three cases involving war crimes, on the side of the alleged war criminals. He pardoned one serviceman who was convicted of heinous crimes, and another awaiting trial for heinous crimes. He also reversed the demotion of a Navy SEAL convicted of taking trophy pictures with an enemy corpse. All were brought to justice by their fellow servicemen and women; each prosecution relied on testimony from servicemen in the same units who witnessed the war crimes and reported them to military superiors. This makes Trump the first commander in chief in memory to pardon American servicemen for violent crimes committed in uniform. The justification can be found in a statement Trump made in 2016: ‘You have to play the game the way they are playing the game.’ That is, the U.S. should operate the way terrorists operate.”

-- The Trump administration’s immigration jails are packed, but deportation numbers are lower than in Barack Obama's presidency. Abigail Hauslohner reports: “According to the latest snapshot of ICE’s prisoner population, from early November, nearly 70 percent of the inmates had no prior criminal conviction. More than 14,000 are people the U.S. government has determined have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture if deported. Though [Trump] has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his first term, his administration lags far behind President Barack Obama’s pace of deportations. Obama — who immigrant advocates at one point called the ‘deporter in chief’ — removed 409,849 people in 2012 alone. Trump, who has vowed to deport ‘millions’ of immigrants, has yet to surpass 260,000 deportations in a single year. And while Obama deported 1.18 million people during his first three years in office, Trump has deported fewer than 800,000. It is unclear why deportations have been happening relatively slowly.”

-- England’s Prince Andrew hoped that an interview with the BBC about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein would put an end to a scandal that has dogged him for years. It didn’t go quite as planned. Karla Adam reports: “An example of some of the exchanges: Andrew: ‘Do I regret the fact that he [Epstein] has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.’ Emily Maitlis: ‘Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.’ Andrew: ‘Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m being polite.’ The interview was undoubtedly a coup for the BBC, which was in talks with the palace for nearly a year to secure it, and for Maitlis, the journalist whose interrogation has won widespread acclaim. But royal watchers described the interview as ill-judged and excruciating. ‘I expected a train wreck,’ tweeted Charlie Proctor, editor of the Royal Central website. ‘That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.’ …

""Andrew told Maitlis that he flew to New York in December 2010 to end his friendship with Epstein, because breaking it off over the phone would have been a ‘chicken’s way of doing it.’ At the time, Epstein had served time in prison for child sex offenses. Andrew said he stayed at Epstein’s home for four days because it was ‘convenient.’ Andrew was also criticized for what he didn’t say. He expressed no concern for Epstein’s victims. ‘Not One Single Word of Remorse,’ read a front-page headline on the Mail on Sunday. … Andrew was repeatedly grilled about Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, who has said that Epstein groomed her to have sex with the prince on three occasions. He said he had ‘no recollection’ of meeting her and ‘categorically’ denied having sex with her.”

Gov. John Bel Edwards celebrates his reelection victory on Saturday night in Baton Rouge, La. (Matthew Hinton/AP)

2020 WATCH:

-- Back-to-back losses in key governors’ races send additional warning to Trump ahead of 2020. David Nakamura reports: “When Kentucky’s Republican governor lost his bid for reelection two weeks ago … the president and his allies brushed it off by declaring that Trump had nearly dragged an unpopular incumbent across the finish line. On Sunday, a day after another Trump-backed GOP gubernatorial candidate fell in Louisiana, the president and his surrogates barely mounted a defense. In a barrage of 40 tweets and retweets by Sunday evening, Trump didn’t mention Eddie Rispone’s loss to incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), even though the president had held two campaign rallies in the state in the 10 days before the election aimed at boosting his chances. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel — who had publicly praised Trump after the Kentucky elections in which the GOP won five other statewide races — also was mum on Louisiana....

“Trump campaigned hard for Rispone and Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) … turning their races into something of a referendum on his own standing … ‘What Trump did in Louisiana was increase voter participation. While he increased the pro-Trump turnout, he also increased the anti-Trump turnout. That’s kind of the lesson here,’ said Ron Faucheux, a nonpartisan political polling analyst based in New Orleans. … In Louisiana, state GOP leaders had pleaded with the president to personally get involved in the race, and Trump held a rally with Rispone in Bossier City on Thursday during which the president cast the contest in personal terms. Referring to Bevin’s loss in Kentucky, Trump complained that the media pinned the defeat on him. ‘So you’ve got to give me a big win, please,’ he told the crowd.”

-- Top Republicans are second guessing Trump's decision to waste so much time in Louisiana. From the Times: “Mr. Trump carried Louisiana by 20 points in 2016, so the outcome of the governor’s race carries no implications for his own re-election, the balance of power in Congress or the president’s policy agenda. And the moderate Mr. Edwards has relentlessly cultivated Mr. Trump, showing up at the White House every chance he gets — so it was not even an opportunity to defeat a critic. Some of the president’s advisers were mystified, therefore, that the White House would repeatedly send him to a state irrelevant to his re-election for a candidate he scarcely knows … after they had just been scalded in their attempt to rescue Mr. Bevin in another safely red state. … Still, the main instigator for the president’s involvement in the races, many Republicans said, was Mr. Trump himself, who simply craves the adulation of his supporters and is singularly focused on notching victories, no matter the details. He is even more eager to flex his political muscle in the face of impeachment, and has surrounded himself with several aides who either defer to his whims regardless of the neon-flashing signs of risk before them, or know little about politics. … People close to Mr. Trump … said he viewed the campaigns he had weighed in on mostly as opportunities for gratification.”

-- Louisiana’s outcome was only possible because of a spike in black turnout. From CNN: “In heavily African American, Caddo, East Baton Rouge and Orleans parishes, turnout was up about 15% to 30% compared to last month's Louisiana ‘jungle primary.’ … Parishes in the rest of the state saw a lower increase in turnout. This trend in the early vote data suggested that African Americans were going to make up a larger share of voters in the runoff than they did in October's jungle primary … One key to turning out black voters is to not merely rely on Trump as a foil. The fact is that Edwards won in Louisiana not because of Trump but because Edwards has been a popular governor with an approval rating north of 50%. He had a strong appeal to the black community in particular. What Edwards demonstrated on Saturday is that Trump is not everything when it comes to elections.”

-- National Democrats are increasingly worried that their presidential nominating contest will drag deep into next summer. Michael Scherer reports: “That scenario is prompting the campaigns, several of which have signed up veteran delegate counters, to begin strategizing for a protracted nomination slog, with some even playing out scenarios for dealmaking in the weeks leading up to the Democratic convention in July. … Broadly, the Democrats’ fear is that the surging energy and turmoil in their party, and its passion to defeat Trump, may be leading to fracturing rather than unity. Some in the party worry that could hamper its ability to defeat Trump, although others argue that a tough primary will strengthen the eventual nominee. Three party veterans, who have each worked on delegate strategies in past presidential contests … described the landscape as unprecedented. … The operatives point to other factors, including the increasing role of small-dollar fundraising, which allows candidates to stay in longer, and the diminished role of superdelegates, whose function was to rally the party around a nominee if needed. They also point to Sen. Bernie Sanders’s medical and political rebound from a heart attack, which suggests he could battle Sen. Elizabeth Warren for liberal voters for months. One delegate counter admitted to concluding it is now 'more likely than not' that no one gets a majority of pledged delegates, largely because of Sanders’s continued strength and the likelihood that he will continue to campaign even if he is trailing late in the primary contest.”

-- Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg apologized for his stop-and-frisk policy ahead of his likely presidential run. Sean Sullivan and Michael Scherer report: “Bloomberg expressed regrets at a predominantly black megachurch he has visited many times, telling congregants he didn’t understand the full effects on African American and Latino communities quickly enough and should have curtailed the program sooner. ‘I’m sorry that we didn’t,’ Bloomberg said. ‘But I can’t change history. However, today, I want you to know that I realize back then, I was wrong.’ The speech served as one of the clearest indicators yet that the billionaire businessman might soon join the crowded Democratic primary. Bloomberg has filed paperwork to run in Alabama and Arkansas and has mapped out a strategy that would largely bypass the four earliest nominating states. Instead, he would focus on later contests of note, including those in Southern states with large black populations. Bloomberg’s attempt to confront one of his biggest potential liabilities reflects the ongoing shift in the Democratic Party on issues of race, criminal justice and police violence. Voters and activists are increasingly demanding their leaders take firmer stances against discrimination by law enforcement and reject tough-on-crime policies that were more widely accepted decades ago.”

-- In Las Vegas on Sunday, Biden drew some groans from a crowd of Democrats when he said he wants more research done on marijuana and suggested that it may be a “gateway drug.” Teo Armus reports: “But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released on Nov. 14. … ‘The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,’ Biden said. ‘It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.’ Answering an audience question, Biden indicated that he is not opposed to the drug entirely. He supports the use of medical marijuana and would decriminalize possession of the drug, he said, adding that he wants individual states to make decisions on recreational use.”

-- A new CBS poll found support for Pete Buttigieg in Iowa has tripled since September and risen seven points since last month. “In addition to his gains in Iowa and New Hampshire, Buttigieg has picked up support in the aggregate 18-state poll. CBS News recontacts voters for this study, and most of Buttigieg's current supporters reported a different first-choice candidate last month, primarily Warren. … The poll asked voters what Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg could do to become a first choice among voters who are considering them. The top answer was convincing voters they could defeat Mr. Trump, which outpaced all other reasons tested, such as convincing voters that their policies would work or that they could handle the job of president.”

-- In case you missed it: Buttigieg rocketed to the top of the Des Moines Register’s Iowa poll that came out on Saturday night. “Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals [Biden, Sanders and Warren], who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind ... [Warren] led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. [Biden], who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. [Sanders] also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”

-- Warren pitched her new, more flexible approach to government-run health care during a swing through Iowa this weekend as her campaign struggles to move beyond a problematic issue for her. Annie Linskey reports: “On Friday, she announced she will push Congress to pass legislation that allows all Americans to opt into the existing Medicare program in her first 100 days in office and take executive actions even sooner to lower the price of prescription drugs. She wouldn’t push for full-blown Medicare-for-all until the third year of her term. … Her new pitch also seems designed to assuage voters worried that her earlier approach would force 150 million people off their private insurance. … That has prompted Sanders to adjust, adding a line to his stump speech that contrasts Warren’s approach to his. ‘Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all single-payer legislation,’ he said Saturday in East Los Angeles. ...

“Several who attended Warren’s town hall ... were relieved by her new approach. ‘I like the shift,’ said Elizabeth Texley, 43, of Cedar Rapids. Texley works with seniors and hasn’t yet decided who she will support in the upcoming caucuses. ‘The goal of Medicare-for-all is great,’ she said. ‘But I don’t think you’re going to be able to get everybody on board right now.’ Warren’s new proposal, Texley added, ‘does make it easier to support her.’”

-- Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, promoting the Nevada caucuses, said Iowa and New Hampshire are not diverse enough states to provide Democrats with insight into how a candidate will fare across the country. From the AP: “‘I don’t think it matters what happens in Iowa or New Hampshire because those states are not representative of the country anymore,’ the longtime Nevada senator said. Nevada is the third state to weigh in but the first that looks like the rest of the country, with a sizeable Latino population and significant groups of Asian American and black voters … Reid, who says he won’t endorse until after Nevada’s Feb. 22 caucuses, said it’s too early to start counting candidates out of the race and he’s impressed with the packed field. Reid said he thinks that Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”

-- Democrats in California are wondering if it’s time for Kamala Harris to finally drop out of the race. From Politico: “In the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”

-- An Obama-era Pentagon official who attacked Trump over his affinity for Russia is entering the crowded New York Democratic primary field to succeed retiring Rep. Nita Lowey (D). Anne Gearan reports: “Evelyn Farkas, a national security analyst and author, will announce her campaign Monday and attend a candidate forum not far from Chappaqua, the New York town where she grew up. She is the fifth Democrat to launch a bid to represent the safely Democratic 17th District, located in the affluent northern suburbs of New York City. But Farkas said her experience helps her stand out. ‘There isn’t another candidate who has my experience and qualifications,’ she said in an exclusive interview Sunday. Farkas served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in charge of policy toward Russia, Ukraine and neighboring countries under [Obama]. She was an early critic of Trump’s relationship with [Putin].”

The photo mix-up is just the latest controversy to erupt around the Douglass Plan since it was rolled out in July as part of Buttigieg’s effort to make inroads with black voters. While recent polling has shown Buttigieg surging toward the front of the crowded Democratic presidential field in Iowa, the candidate has struggled to draw support from African Americans.

Some critics pointed to the photo as further proof of that disconnect.

By late Sunday, Buttigieg’s campaign confirmed to The Washington Post that the photo of the Kenyan woman was no longer on the page promoting the Douglass Plan, noting that it had been taken down in September during an update. A contracting firm had chosen the stock image while building the site without knowing that it was taken in Africa, according to the campaign.

AD

The photo was one of several featuring people of color that ran on the page touting the Douglass Plan. Named after abolitionist and activist Frederick Douglass, the plan aims to “dismantle racist structures and systems” in the United States by proposing changes to the country’s health, education and criminal justice systems, The Post reported in July.

AD

Last month, the campaign announced that more than 400 people in South Carolina, where the latest Monmouth Poll had Buttigieg at 1 percent among black voters, endorsed the plan. The news was promoted in an Oct. 24 op-ed signed by the plan’s supporters and three black South Carolina Democrats: Columbia City Council member Tameika Isaac Devine, state Rep. Ivory Thigpen, and the state party’s Black Caucus chair, Johnnie Cordero.

“There is one presidential candidate who has proven to have intentional policies designed to make a difference in the Black experience, and that’s Pete Buttigieg,” according to the op-ed, which ran in HBCU Times, a publication dedicated to news about historically black colleges and universities. “We are over 400 South Carolinians, including business owners, pastors, community leaders, and students. Together, we endorse his Douglass Plan for Black America, the most comprehensive roadmap for tackling systemic racism offered by a 2020 presidential candidate.”

AD

But questions soon emerged about the nature of support Buttigieg had found for the plan. The Washington Post reported on Nov. 11 that “Buttigieg persuaded hundreds of prominent black South Carolinians to sign onto the plan even if they are not supporting his candidacy.”

AD

“His campaign then trumpeted these signatures in a way that forced figures such as Devine, for one, to clarify that she was not endorsing Buttigieg,” The Post’s Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Amy B Wang wrote.

On Friday, Devine told the Intercept that the campaign had been “intentionally vague” about the way it presented her endorsement, which led some to believe she was backing Buttigieg as a candidate and not just the Douglass Plan. The council member reiterated her support for the plan in a tweet over the weekend.

Cordero and Thigpen, however, told the Intercept they did not expect their names to appear on the op-ed.

“I never endorsed that plan,” Cordero said. “I don’t know how my name got on there.”

Thigpen, who has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president, said the way Buttigieg’s campaign rolled out its October announcement “was not an accurate representation of where I stand.”

AD

Cordero’s name was taken off the op-ed before the Intercept’s story published, according to Buttigieg’s campaign. Thigpen remains as one of the named supporters.

People who expressed interest in backing the plan had the option to opt out of having their names attached to the op-ed if they responded in time to an email sent by the campaign, the Intercept reported. After reviewing the names, the publication found that at least 42 percent of the list was made up of white voters.

AD

In a statement to The Post on Sunday, a spokesman for the campaign said, “We’ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication.” The statement also pushed back against allegations that the campaign “gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete.”

AD

“We asked a number of Black South Carolinians, as well as South Carolinians from many backgrounds, to support the Douglass Plan, and we are proud and grateful that hundreds agreed to do so,” the statement said, noting that people were given multiple chances to review the op-ed and those who asked had their names taken off.

This weekend, conversation shifted to the photo, which Grim pointed out Friday had been taken in Kenya. In a Sunday tweet, he explained the Kenyan woman reached out to him “very confused” about why her picture was suddenly linked to an American presidential candidate. Grim added that the woman did agree to be photographed, but “didn’t intend to pose for a stock photo.”

By early Monday, Grim’s tweet had garnered hundreds of responses.

One person accused Buttigieg’s campaign of “pure laziness.”

When South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg invested a big chunk of his impressive 2017 fundraising haul in building a strong organization (more than 100 staffers and 20 field offices, according to CNN) in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, he was gambling on an early breakthrough. It could be paying off: Multiple polls are showing him running first in Iowa.

If there was any doubt Mayor Pete’s having a moment there, it was dispelled this weekend by the latest gold-standard Iowa Poll from Ann Selzer for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom. Selzer shows Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely caucusgoers, with a healthy lead over Elizabeth Warren at 16 percent and both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders at 15 percent. Mayor Pete was only at 9 percent in Selzer’s last poll in September. And his internals look good: His favorability/unfavorability rating is a best-in-the-field 72/16, with 42 percent rating him “very favorably.” He’s second behind only Warren in second-choice support, and is nicely positioned ideologically, with 63 percent rating him “about right” instead of “too liberal” (7 percent) or “too conservative” (13 percent). By contrast, 53 percent said Bernie Sanders was “too liberal” and 38 percent said the same of Warren, while 28 percent labeled Biden as “too conservative.”

Buttigieg also led in a recent Monmouth poll in Iowa, and was functionally tied with the other members of the Big Four in others, and now leads the RealClearPolitics polling average for the state. If there’s any downside in his Iowa polling it’s that he may be peaking too early; a potential Biden-alternative centrist, Amy Klobuchar, is gradually moving up in the rankings. (She’s fifth in the Selzer poll at 6 percent; no one else has more than 3 percent.)

If Iowa is at the moment looking like Pete Country, his standing is significantly weaker in other early states. He’s at 14 percent in the RCP averages in Iowa’s kissing-cousin and rival, New Hampshire, and at around 7 percent in Nevada and South Carolina. And best we can tell from available crosstabs, Buttigieg is still registering negligible support from minority voters, which is no big handicap in Iowa and New Hampshire, but begins to matter a lot more the minute after New Hampshire ends. A new Fox News poll of Nevada shows Mayor Pete with 2 percent of the nonwhite vote there. (He’s behind Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard among nonwhite voters.) And a Monmouth poll of South Carolina a few weeks ago placed Buttigieg’s support among the black voters who represent well over half the primary electorate at one percent. Even if he wins Iowa, he won’t get much of a bounce beyond New Hampshire until that begins to change.

Still, at the moment you’d rather be him than, say, Kamala Harris or Cory Booker, who also invested heavily in an Iowa organization but are both at 3 percent in Selzer’s poll, and who trail Buttigieg in Nevada and aren’t doing much better than him in South Carolina despite being African-Americans themselves. If, as is quite possibly the case, only four candidates survive Iowa in any kind of viable shape, at this point it looks like it will be Warren, Biden, Sanders — and Pete Buttigieg."

Yes, despite the Trump impeachment hearings, the Democratic presidential candidate debates continue. And when qualifying for the November 20 stage in Atlanta ended at midnight last Wednesday, ten candidates made the cut: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. The podium arrangement hasn’t been announced yet, but it’s likely going to be Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren at center stage.

The October debaters missing in Atlanta will be the two Texans: Beto O’Rourke, who dropped out of the race two weeks ago, and Julián Castro, who met the donor threshold for inclusion but did not have a single qualifying national or early state poll. Castro has said that “it will be the end of my campaign” if he failed to qualify, so there is a death watch on his candidacy. So we are back to the ten-candidate stage that we had in June and July.

As the debaters prepare for Atlanta, qualifying for the December 19 debate in Los Angeles is well underway (the cutoff date is December 12), with higher donor (200,000) and polling (four early state or national polls at 4 percent or more, or two early state polls at 6 percent or more) thresholds. Just six candidates have made that cut: Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Klobuchar, Sanders, and Warren. Of the other November debaters, only Yang has met the donor threshold so far (though that’s never been much of an obstacle to aspiring debaters in the past); he’s two debates shy of qualifying. Steyer has his four polls, and just needs to get his donors squared away. Gabbard has one 6 percent–plus early state poll and three 4 percent–plus polls; she needs just one more qualifying poll and then the requisite donors to make the stage.

Cory Booker is in the most trouble right now: He has zero qualifying polls and hasn’t met the donor threshold either. He really needs to cook in Atlanta to lift his standing, but then again, the New Jersey senator has been among the most effective debaters all along, without getting much of a lift. He clearly needs a break, and perhaps a real stumble from someone above him on the slippery pole that ascends up to the nomination."

He could win Iowa, which then often leads to a win in New Hampshire; then that momentum could propel him along through the rest of the primaries.

On the other hand, it’s always possible that this is just a temporary blip of the kind we’ve seen many times before. Herman Cain had a moment, as did Ben Carson and Michele Bachmann. None of them got their party’s nomination.

They were Republicans, however, and the Republican Party tends to be much more interested in candidates with little or no apparent qualifications to be president than Democrats are. The closer we get to the voting, the more difficult it may be for Buttigieg to assure primary voters that the 37-year-old mayor of the 306th largest city in the United States — bigger than Kenosha, Wis., but not quite as big as West Covina, Calif., — really is qualified to be president of the United States.

That’s because Democrats are rather traditional when it comes to candidate qualifications. They took a chance on the youthful Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, but Obama was a senator and Clinton a governor, despite being not that much older than Buttigieg is. (Clinton was 46 and Obama was 47 when they were elected.) They have tended to gravitate toward candidates with extensive government experience, because as the party that believes in government, they want someone who understands it and is capable of making it work effectively.

What he lacks in experience, Buttigieg makes up for in confidence, the kind that comes from having been told a thousand times that he’s going places. Watching him, one can’t help but be reminded of what was once said about a young Al Gore, that he was an old person’s idea of what a young person should be. It’s notable that much as he may talk about generational change, Buttigieg is not actually the candidate of young voters, at least not yet. In the just-released Harvard Youth Poll of voters age 18 to 29, he comes in fifth, with 4 percent support.

AD

AD

Nevertheless, many of his supporters seem to feel that he hits a sweet spot of electability: not too ideological like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but free of the unpredictability surrounding Joe Biden. Yes, he’s gay, but he’s also a white man, which many people find reassuring. “I feel he’s well positioned,” one voter told FiveThirtyEight’s Clare Malone. But electability judgments are fickle; a spate of bad polls or losses in early primaries can quickly make voters decide you look like a loser and not a winner.

Then there’s what may be Buttigieg’s central challenge: Winning over black voters, the heart of the Democratic coalition. So far Buttigieg has polled weakly among them, for a variety of reasons, including controversies over his firing of a black police chief and over police treatment of black residents of South Bend, and a pragmatic tendency in black voters that may make them skeptical of supporting a 30-something small town mayor for president.

Buttigieg has tried to reach out to them with a “Douglass Plan” (named for Frederick Douglass) to address racial inequality, but that has led to some missteps, including the use of a stock photo to illustrate it that turned out to be of a woman and child from Kenya, and touting supporters of the plan who were not exactly supporters.

AD

AD

Those are the kind of staff blunders that, like much of what happens in the campaign, tell you little if anything about what sort of president Buttigieg would be. But he has very little room for error. When you’re that young and that inexperienced, you don’t want to give voters any reason to think you might not be up to the task of the world’s most important job.

Joe Biden leads most polls; Elizabeth Warren has sometimes been considered the real frontrunner; Pete Buttigieg is surging in Iowa. Where does that leave Bernie Sanders? I spoke with politics editor Ezekiel Kweku and senior writer Eric Levitz about whether the Vermont senator has been underestimated in recent weeks, and what his path to the nomination might look like.

Ben: Just a few weeks ago, Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack and told a reporter he’d be cutting back on his vigorous campaign schedule — a remark he quickly took back. Since then, he has shown no sign of physical problems, had probably his strongest debate yet, and done quite well in early-state polls, consistently bunched up near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire. In the lefty lane, Elizabeth Warren has gotten a lot of the attention lately, what with the billionaires arrayed against her. Are (some) people now underrating Bernie’s chances to actually win this thing?

Ezekiel: My feeling is that his relative strength with black and Latino voters compared to Warren makes him a tier-one candidate, which is what I’ve always believed, and putting him below that is underrating him.

Ben: Indeed, there have been multiple pieces recently about his solid Latino support. And in a South Carolina poll released this week, he was second only to Biden among black voters (granted, there was a 34 point drop-off).

Eric: Some surely are underrating him. I think Warren has lost steam due to her front-runner status triggering more skeptical media coverage (her related decision to dig into Medicare for All financing may have also played some role). That, plus Sanders’s surprisingly robust (ostensible) health, plus the firmness of his core support, plus strength of his fundraising, plus new centrist candidates coming out of the woodwork to split the vote have all made his odds look a bit better in recent weeks. The more crowded the field in Iowa, the more plausible it is that Bernie rides the devotion of his core base to a narrow plurality win, which could then boost him to victory in New Hampshire, which would probably force Warren out of the race. So you can construct a path.

Ben: The usual knock on Bernie in terms of his viability is that he has his diehards, but has had trouble expanding beyond that group. Would he necessarily be the first place Warren voters looked if their candidate went down? Numbers show that the Warren and Buttigieg fan base, for example, may have more in common, demographic-wise, than the Warren and Bernie fan bases.

Eric: I think it would partly depend on whether she endorses, and whether her supporters in the progressive media/think tank world see Bernie as viable enough to rally behind. A lot depends on what the rest of the field looks like. If Bernie wins Iowa and New Hampshire, I’m not sure that Pete makes it too far. Could become a Bernie-Biden race fairly quickly.

Ezekiel: I agree that it will depend on who she endorses. I also feel like we tend to overestimate how ideological even primaries are. I haven’t checked since the Buttigieg boom, but polls of “second choices” tended not to conform with ideology. So I think you’re onto something when you say that Warren’s voters may not necessarily flow to Sanders. I think the fact that voters are so focused on electability makes the race more fluid than it would ordinarily be. If a candidate stumbles in a way that makes them seem less plausible in a general election, it could kill their candidacy pretty quickly. I think that’s what happened with Harris, for instance.

Ben: Sanders enjoys tweaking the press for downplaying his odds, and him in general. I often find those criticisms to be overdone. But it is true that Warren has many supporters in the world of opinion-shaping media — to what extent does that play a role in their diverging (and now more converging) paths?

Eric: I think one reason for Warren’s high support (relative to Sanders) among opinion-shaping media is that she is better exemplar of (progressive) professional-class virtue. She comes to politics through policy wonkery, and seems to have really done her homework on all the major issues. Whereas Sanders is a former overeducated, underemployed left-wing activist who is less detail-oriented in his policy advocacy. A second reason is that she is a bit less hostile to the Democratic Party as an institution. I think those two qualities also give her a distinct (and potentially larger) coalition among Democratic primary voters than Bernie’s. I think she derives some independent benefit from her support among opinion journalists. But I think her main media advantage had been that even MSM reportage on her was kind of soft, in part because the Fourth Estate wants a competitive race and admires her emphasis on policy.

Once she became the front-runner though, mainstream coverage turned a bit, and that’s helped Bernie gain ground. I do think if Sanders starts outpolling Warren consistently, you’ll see coverage of him become much more prominent and intensely negative, which might knock him right back down, especially if his rivals successfully stoke the electability fears Ezekiel referenced.

Ezekiel: I confess that I have found the Warren/Bernie debates to be tiresome in an unproductive manner for awhile — but I think Warren is more popular than Bernie with the media because of the way she has consistently framed her positions in terms of old-school American liberalism (which the media likes) instead of “democratic socialism,” which the media does not like. The reasons that the media doesn’t like that framing is part of why Bernie chose it in the first place, so I don’t really understand the complaints that the media doesn’t like Bernie. I think the wonkery is a little less causal. You can easily imagine Warren getting the “egghead professor with ivory tower plans” label if she had framed her candidacy in a way similar to Sanders.

Eric: True. She does still get a little of that, to be fair.

Ben: The biggest vein of negative coverage for Warren has concerned her attachment to Medicare for All, the policy Bernie really popularized. Warren backed off her all-or-nothing approach last week in an effort to appease possibly uncomfortable voters, but it’s hard to imagine Bernie doing something similar. If he gets closer to the nomination, will he encounter the same level of skepticism she did? Or does he sort of get extra credit for having been touting his exact vision of the world for many years? Can he use his authenticity, in other words, as a kind of shield?

Eric: Well, Warren ended up facing more skepticism than Sanders on M4A financing (even though he has not released any detailed plan for how he’d pay for his version of the program) for two reasons: (1) At the last debate, everyone had an incentive to take a swing at the new front-runner, and no one considered the 78-year-old socialist who’d just come back from a heart attack to be a serious threat. (2) Bernie copped to the need to raise middle-class taxes to some degree, while Warren didn’t.

I think if Bernie moved solidly into second place, Biden & Co. would stop saying “at least Bernie has leveled with the American people on this” and start pointing out that the list of pay-fors he released does not add up to the estimated cost of his program.

Ezekiel: I feel like her phase-in approach (like her head tax) is an attempt to avoid getting criticism from the media, and I think it might work. The problem with it is that the more complicated your approach, the harder it is to rebut attacks on it effectively. I don’t think her new approach is going to blunt attacks from other candidates in the primary, and I don’t think it will be easier to defend in a general election. I could be wrong.

Eric: I think Warren subsequently decided that Bernie has a lock on single-issue single-payer voters, and so there’s a bit less upside for her to remain 100 percent ideologically maximalist on the issue than for him. Mostly though, I think her campaign was probably freaked out by Pete’s sudden surge in Iowa. I have no idea how her pivot will play out politically.

Ben: Do you have any thoughts about Bernie’s “electability” versus the other front-runners right now? He has a good case that he’d activate voters disgusted by both parties in a way that no other candidate would?

Eric: I think there are decent electability arguments for and against all the major candidates. I think Bernie’s is stronger than mainstream punditry (which, in my view, tends to mechanically equate policy moderation with electability) suggests. The fact that he has served as an Independent for decades gives him some appeal to anti-Establishment indie voters of various ideological stripes. Or so Nate Cohn’s recent polling suggests. Meanwhile, his rhetorical emphasis on class and “bread-and-butter issues” appears more electorally expedient than Clinton’s 2016 emphasis on Trump’s unfitness for office/a cosmopolitan conception of American identity. And he’d help minimize the threat of a left-wing third-party challenger (albeit potentially increasing the threat of a centrist one).

Ezekiel: I don’t have a good answer to that, I’ll be honest. Right now I feel like loosely attached indie voters might be more attracted to Sanders, but I’m not sure what will happen to that if he were to actually be in a general election with Trump. I can imagine diminished enthusiasm with bundlers and donors being a problem — it kind of depends on how strongly the Establishment would rally to him if he were to win. A lot of unknowns."

Barack Obama broke his silence on the 2020 Democratic primary Friday with a stern warning to his party’s presidential hopefuls. “Voters, including Democrats, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain … Twitter feeds, or the activist wing of our party,” Obama said. “And that’s not a criticism to the activist wing — their job is to poke and prod and text and inspire and motivate. But the candidate’s job, whoever that ends up being, is to get elected.”

The Democratic base will bristle at these sentiments. We all want to believe that the Venn diagram of our preferred policies — and the most electorally expedient ones — is a perfect circle. We all want our leaders to stop mincing words, and start making a bold, unapologetic case for our agenda until its moral truth becomes unmistakable to all (or at least a plurality of voters in Wisconsin). But that just isn’t how politics works. And the stakes of evicting Trump from the Oval Office next year are too high for Democrats to use their presidential primary as a venue for its base’s ideological self-expression. The party’s rank-and-file may revere Joe Biden more than any other candidate. Nevertheless, they must heed Obama’s advice — and recognize that Uncle Joe’s far-out views on weed would harsh the heartland’s vibes.

At a town hall in Las Vegas, Nevada, Saturday, the Democratic front-runner was asked if his longtime opposition to the legalization of marijuana has changed. Here’s how he replied:

No, it hasn’t changed. I think, look, I think states should be able to make a judgement to legalize marijuana. I think that’s okay. But let me tell ya, the truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that’s been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug. It’s a debate. And I want a lot more, before I legalize it nationally, I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it. That’s why I want to move it from a Schedule 1 drug to a Schedule 3, so you can in fact do this.

Biden said states should decide on legalization & that he supports medical marijuana. @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/s4CE32phLS — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) November 17, 2019

This position may play well with anti-legalization activists on Twitter, or nanny-state-loving paleo-progressives. But salt-of-the-earth Americans in flyover country want big government to keep its hands off their bongs.

A Pew Research survey released last week found that 67 percent of Americans believe “the use of marijuana should be made legal.” A recent Gallup poll put that figure at (a statistically identical) 66 percent. Critically, weed legalization isn’t just popular with the public as a whole, but also with key Electoral College constituencies. In Pew’s survey, non-college-educated voters — who are overrepresented in battleground states — were even more likely to support legalization than college-educated ones, with only 31 percent of working-class Americans backing Biden’s stance.

This comports with the findings of a recent poll from the progressive think tank Data for Progress and data-science firm Civis Analytics. By fielding a large-sample national survey and then applying state-of-the-art demographic modeling techniques to its results, DFP was able to estimate the level of support for marijuana legalization in all 50 states. It found legal weed polling at (a very nice) 69 percent among all registered voters in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and at 68 percent with such voters in Michigan. Meanwhile, independent voters in those states backed legalization at even higher levels, with nearly three-fourths of indie Michiganders, Wisconsinite, and Pennsylvanians voicing approval (support among independents in Sun Belt battlegrounds like Florida and Arizona was nearly identical). What’s more, in an unsurprising finding — given younger Americans’ relatively high affinity for marijuana and low propensity for casting ballots — support for legalizing weed among registered nonvoters in battleground states hovered around 75 percent. The analysis’s most remarkable finding, however, may have been this: A majority of Trump voters in 49 U.S. states backed an end to weed prohibition.

Marijuana legalization might not be the most important or salient issue of the day. But there simply aren’t many other policy fights that are more favorable to the Democratic Party. Hoping to win back non-college-educated independents in the Rust Belt? Nearly three-quarters of them want Uncle Sam to recognize their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of dank kush. Want to run a “mobilization” campaign that brings Dem-leaning nonvoters off of democracy’s sidelines? Virtually all of them are high on legal weed. Worried that narrowcasting to targeted constituencies could pull Democrats too far from the American mainstream? Even among Republican voters, a solid majority are 420 friendly.

Biden’s defenders will note that he doesn’t oppose the decriminalization of marijuana possession, only the legalization of its sale. But such equivocation just blunts the Democrats’ advantage on the issue, by needlessly killing the buzz of pro-pot constituencies and advocacy organizations. On weed legalization, the preferred policy of the cause’s most ardent supporters is the same as that of critical swing voters. Biden’s stance demobilizes the former, for the sake of appealing slightly less to the latter. Virtually every other candidate in the 2020 race recognizes the folly of Biden’s stance: Everyone from Amy Klobuchar to Pete Buttigieg to Bernie Sanders has endorsed legalizing recreational marijuana in no uncertain terms.

Biden’s decision to put principle above political expediency on this issue may command respect in some quarters. But we’ve seen where that gets us. Hillary Clinton heeded the radical center’s demands for ideological purity on pot in 2016, and two pro-legalization third-party candidates combined for an exceptionally high share of ballots, thereby eroding her margin for error in key Rust Belt states. Democrats can’t afford to make the same mistake twice. They must hear the subtext of Obama’s advice: It would be nothing short of political malpractice to vote for Joe Biden and his reefer madness."

In keeping with that message, Buttigieg told Democrats in Nevada, “I’m running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, gather up the pieces of our divided nation and lead us toward a better future.” On health care specifically, he promised, “Rather than polarize the American people, I will mobilize the American majority that stands ready for the most progressive change to health care in a half century — finally delivering Medicare for All Who Want It — as long as we protect the freedom to decide for yourself whether you want it.” He added for emphasis: “Even if you don’t agree with the precise dimensions of this or that policy, that does not mean you should be written out of a particular political party. You belong.”

He came back repeatedly to the theme of unity. He called for support ""whether you are a progressive or a moderate or what I like to call a future former Republican.” To lead and win, he said, “It is going to take a lot more than the political warfare we’ve come to expect in Washington, D.C. We already have a divider in chief.”

In a similar vein, Klobuchar told the Nevada audience, “We are at our best when we bring people together.” She made clear that Democrats can win, as they did in the Kentucky and Louisiana gubernatorial races and in the Virginia state legislature, when they turn out the base “but also some independents and some moderate Republicans who are sick and tired of this guy.” She added, “We are at our best when we bring people together instead of shutting them out.” To win “big” by taking the presidency and the Senate, she says, “We need to bring the country with us.”

You would be forgiven if you thought these were part of a long-running jab at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who until she unveiled her “transition” plan on Medicare-for-all was writing former vice president Joe Biden out of the party (“running in the wrong presidential primary”) for opposing Medicare-for-all. (Presumably Warren was also writing out many of the other Democratic presidential candidates and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also disfavor that approach.) Given the blowback that Warren received on Medicare-for-all, and her retreat to a stopgap that looks a lot like the plans Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar put forward, the two Midwest moderates are applying some valuable lessons.

AD

AD

First, a sizable number of the Democratic primary electorate voters are very nervous about selecting a candidate too far to the left who will fail to pick up winnable voters and winnable states. Recent state polling has added to the sense of anxiety that the Midwest is hardly in the bag. Conversely, they saw conservative Democrats win in governor’s races in two red states, Kentucky and Louisiana. If Democrats want to win big, they had better think about how their policies, tone and personality are going to come across beyond the two coasts.

Klobuchar recently made a tour of “blue wall” states that Democrats know they must win (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin). She speaks of herself as the candidate from the heartland. This is not just about geography. She says she knows that these people — “workers and farmers who are my friends and neighbors” — from these states are not looking for a revolution. When Klobuchar says, as she did in Nevada, that Democrats ""cannot screw this up,” she strikes a chord with party donors, insiders and ordinary voters who fear they might do exactly that.

Second, the country, Democrats included, is suffering from Trump exhaustion. Buttigieg promises that with him in the White House, our blood pressure will go down, not up. Perhaps serenity is not possible in a highly polarized and tribalistic political era, but there is something to be said about someone who sounds like the calmest person in the room. Buttigieg’s measured style is certainly a contrast with President Trump, and demonstrates that one need not be soporific to engender confidence. No one would accuse Klobuchar, who deploys wisecracks at Trump’s expense, of being dull, but her no-nonsense approach speaks to Americans who want attainable, concrete advances (e.g. limits on prescription drug costs).

AD

AD

Finally, Klobuchar and Buttigieg are taking issue with the notion that if they don’t “fight” everyone and everything, progressive change is impossible. Klobuchar says she doesn’t want to be president for “half of America,” just as Buttigieg talks about picking up the pieces Trump leaves behind. They know they cannot rely on Democratic majorities or supermajorities.

They are not relying on a Republican epiphany; they want to win big and then peel off Republicans willing to join their agenda. Is that unrealistic? It’s certainly more realistic than imagining that Wisconsin, Michigan or other Midwest voters want a revolution to remake health care, decriminalize illegal border crossings or offer “free” college (among other things). These candidates are betting that Democrats want a nominee fresher and younger than Biden but firmly planted in the center-left. In a way, Warren’s retreat suggests that she might agree with that analysis.

As we move into 2020 we’re going to be subjected to endless repetitions of a slight variant of that story. NBC News, in a move destined to be copied by other major news organizations, is training its telescope on the only Americans who matter:

Meet the Press moderator and political director Chuck Todd and reporters Vaughn Hillyard and Dasha Burns will provide coverage from Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, Kent County in Michigan, Beaver County in Pennsylvania, Miami-Dade County in Florida and Maricopa County in Arizona. The project is called County to County. The reporters will interview and remain in touch with residents in the counties as the race progresses, and the stories will appear on NBC News, MSNBC, NBC News Now. There also will be online features with information on the counties and why they were selected.

This project differs from the mountain of Trump-supporters-in-a-diner story in that it will presumably interview Democrats, Republicans, and independents. But the logic is the same: This relatively small number of Americans are the ones who really matter.

AD

AD

But isn’t it true that those voters really are more important? They’re going to decide the election! In one sense, that’s true. The trouble is that it takes the the twisted logic of the electoral college — which says that the only voters whose opinions are worthy of concern are the ones who live in about a half-dozen swing states — and turns it into a news template. It reifies and justifies one of the most undemocratic features of our electoral system.

If you live in Texas or California or South Dakota or New York or Oregon or Mississippi or any other state where the presidential election is unlikely to be close, you just aren’t that important. Journalists will not be nudging into your booth to pepper you with questions about what you’re worried or hopeful about. They will not treat you and your neighbors like gods of democracy whose whims should and will decide the fate of the nation. You’re just background noise, something the savvy among us know to ignore.

But how will we know how the election is going to turn out if we don’t spend time talking to those precious swing voters in those precious swing counties in those precious swing states?

AD

AD

Here’s a crazy idea: What if predicting the outcome of the election is not actually the most important thing to spend your time worrying about?

It’s not that we shouldn’t wonder how the election will turn out at all. It’s unavoidable. And it’s perfectly fine to think about it (and report about it, and write about it, and talk about it) sometimes. Anyone who works in politics in any way will tell you that when they talk to friends and relatives, the first question everyone has is “What’s going to happen?”

But that’s a tendency to be tempered, even fought against, not embraced wholeheartedly. We can spend all our time trying to predict what will happen, or we can worry about what’s actually important, like what all Americans are concerned about, and what the challenges of governing will be, and what problems need addressing, and how candidates’ proposed policies will affect people’s lives.

AD

AD

Unfortunately, the primary process trains us to think in a particular way, which we then transfer to the general election. Right now the presidential candidates are pandering relentlessly to the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire. Many of them luxuriate in it; there are voters in those states who literally will not vote for a presidential candidate who didn’t meet them, shake their hand, look deeply into their eyes, and convince them of their sincerity.

It doesn’t help that the voters to whom we’ve given all this power are terribly unrepresentative of the country as a whole; alone among the presidential candidates, Julián Castro had the courage to note that Iowa is “not reflective of the diversity of our country, and certainly not reflective of the diversity of the Democratic Party.”

But after all that groveling before Iowans, it seems completely natural that the nominee will then turn to groveling before Wisconsinites and Michiganders. Still, even if that’s a necessary strategy for them to win the election, it doesn’t have to determine what the rest of us worry about.

ATLANTA — The month between the last Democratic debate and tomorrow's brought something new to the party's crowded primary: momentum.

Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar piled on Elizabeth Warren over how she'd pay for Medicare-for-all, and both began moving up in Iowa. Warren took their criticism seriously and rolled out both a payment plan and a transition plan that answered skeptics; for the first time, she declined slightly in the polls.

The result has been a shift in the contest for Iowa. Joe Biden entered the third debate leading in that state's polls. Warren entered the fourth debate having edged ahead of Biden. Buttigieg has now moved ahead, marginally, in a state that can elevate long-shot candidates. And some of the candidates onstage risk being cut out entirely from future debates, despite everything they've built so far. There are more desperate candidates than we've seen so far in these debates, and more candidates with something big to prove.

We don't know what direction moderators will take in this debate. We do know what to look for.

What does Buttigieg do under pressure? Buttigieg is in the position that Warren held for months: a top contender for the nomination who has taken few hits onstage. The hits he did take came from candidates in decline (former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, who accused Buttigieg of lacking courage) or candidates disliked by most Democratic voters (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who tried to steer Buttigieg into a fight about military intervention in Syria). Buttigieg came out ahead every time and did what was impossible for weaker candidates: He went after Warren and improved his own favorable rating, framing his argument around her own reluctance to give a cost estimate for Medicare-for-all. (When she revealed one, he stopped attacking.)

Buttigieg's rivals can't let that happen again, but it's hard to define who those rivals are. Every other campaign has some level of contempt for the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Some have expressed it subtly, like Warren decrying “consultant-driven” campaigns; some have been more direct, like former HUD secretary Julián Castro warning that Buttigieg can't excite nonwhite voters.

Castro, of course, won't be onstage, but Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California will, and she's hinted at her own problems with Buttigieg. In Las Vegas, at a Monday forum on racial justice that Buttigieg did not attend, Harris noted that she did not “just acquire the language to talk about” race. Afterward, she piled on Buttigieg for releasing a “Douglass plan” for black America that touted support from activists who had not actually endorsed it and was published alongside a stock photo of a mother and child in Kenya.

“I don't have words to describe that,” Harris said.

In the past, Buttigieg has gotten around tough questions with the help of rival candidates who didn't want to attack him. At the first debate, in June, he responded to a question about racial tensions and a disproportionately white police force in South Bend by admitting that he hadn't fixed the problem. Blink-and-you-missed-him candidate Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) pounced, but no one else did.

Can Elizabeth Warren fight from a corner? The Massachusetts senator's slip in the polls could benefit her in one small way: It's put more pressure on Buttigieg. Candidates have only so much time to tangle, and in debates so far, Warren has not been attacked on several story lines that Democrats see as vulnerabilities: her corporate legal advice, her late-in-life membership with the party, her past claims of Native American ancestry.

Nothing is preventing her rivals from going after those things, and Biden spent the better part of two weeks attacking Warren for an “elitist attitude” after she accused his campaign of issuing “Republican talking points” on Medicare-for-all. That fight was notable, because it was the first that Warren seemed to start: Exasperated by the accusations of fuzzy math, she said Democrats who attacked universal Medicare were running in the “wrong primary.” Warren never used that language again and instead spent weeks sketching out a comprehensive transition plan for single-payer health care.

The old question for Warren — how would she pay for Medicare-for-all? — is no longer operative. It has been replaced by potential questions about whether her math holds up, whether she can be trusted to stick to a position and whether, Pete Buttigieg's campaign has suggested, her plan simply mirrors his. There are substantial differences in the plans, and not much of an appetite for another hour of Medicare-for-all infighting, especially when Biden is ready to dismiss all of it as a needless, radical rejection of President Barack Obama's legacy. Warren's campaign has readied itself for attacks on her past and has been occasionally surprised when they haven't come.

Does Sanders still treat Warren like a partner? The two senators representing the party's left wing have played supportive roles in most of their time onstage. There was just one exception, in last month's debate, when moderators asked Sanders whether Medicare-for-all would raise middle-class taxes. “I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,” Sanders said, putting more pressure on Warren. (“At least that's a straightforward answer,” Buttigieg snarked.)

Since then, Sanders has gotten many more chances to criticize Warren and taken just a few, avoiding the harsh tone of some of his supporters. After she introduced her plan to pay for Medicare-for-all, Sanders said that simply raising progressive income taxes was a better way of funding universal health care; Warren's employer tax, he said, could cost jobs. On the day she introduced her transition plan, Sanders was accepting the support of the pro-single-payer National Nurses United: He said that unlike Warren, he would introduce his Medicare-for-all legislation on the first day of his presidency and fight for the entire package to be passed, “not put it off for several years.”

For the first time, Sanders and Warren do have slightly different plans: Warren would use her first budget to begin enrolling people in an expanded version of Medicare but not end duplicative private insurance until three years later. The question is whether Sanders, who is generally viewed by voters as more trustworthy than Warren, explores that question or defends the overall goal of his legislation, shared by Warren, against all comers.

If he decides that he can benefit if Warren gets tangled up onstage, it would represent the first major break between them. He has far more to argue about with Biden and Buttigieg, starting with Biden's 180-degree flip on super PACs and continuing with Buttigieg's adoption of the “Medicare-for-all” brand into “Medicare-for-all who want it.” At the same time, his campaign sees an advantage in Buttigieg's rise, as it cuts off white Democrats with college degrees from Warren.

Does Joe Biden (finally) assuage some doubts? There's a way this debate goes well for Biden; if it does, that would be a first. The impression that Biden is slowing down, and less ready to tackle President Trump than Democrats might have wanted, has grown with each debate night. Neither he nor Warren benefited from the Medicare-for-all fight, and he got past a round about Hunter Biden's work largely because the other candidates decided not to keep it going. Paradoxically, though Biden still leads in national and later-state polling, his rivals do not treat him like a threat.

That leaves a lot up to moderators. Biden could be asked about the policies where he breaks with Democratic voters, like marijuana legalization; he could be asked to pick up the argument with Warren, something he's not always done with gusto. He has, so far, declined to attack Warren on her short history with the Democratic Party, even though his campaign has gone there. Under pressure, Biden has often gotten defensive about his record, and none of those incidents (such as turning to Warren and near-shouting that he got her the votes for the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau) has gone well for him. Biden has no ideological problem with the party's voters; he has a style and presentation problem, which a good debate could fix.

Is Gabbard still running against Hillary Clinton? Believe it or not, Gabbard's argument with Hillary Clinton, the highest-profile moment of her campaign, happened in the five short weeks between the last debate and this one. The Hawaii congresswoman is still talking about Clinton claiming that Republicans were “grooming” her for a third-party spoiler run and still framing her candidacy as a challenge to the “Trump-Clinton doctrine.” She has studiously refused to attack Biden, who shares Clinton's foreign policy record, and has looked for chances to probe whether Warren or Buttigieg would endorse American military adventurism.

Gabbard entered the fourth debate with high expectations, some set by her campaign. She didn't deliver, as an attempt to challenge Warren's “commander in chief” credentials was cut short and as Warren seemed to surprise her by agreeing that America should reduce its presence in the Middle East. Gabbard is also in the same position as Harris and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey on Medicare-for-all: She has co-sponsored the bill but doesn't promise to implement it in full. Since the Clinton spat, Gabbard's poll numbers with Democrats have fallen as her numbers with independents and Republicans have spiked, so her ability to get on the next debate stage wouldn't be hurt if she went negative.

What do the on-the-bubble candidates try? Three of the candidates onstage tomorrow have not yet qualified for December's debate: Gabbard, Booker and Andrew Yang. (Tom Steyer qualified this week on the strength of his numbers in a new South Carolina poll.) Only one of those candidates, Booker, has yet to hit December's qualifying number in a single poll. And he has given every indication that he'll stay positive, while possibly contrasting himself with candidates who get accused of shifting to win votes.

“I'm not focus-grouping and poll-testing who I am,” Booker said this weekend in Las Vegas. “The person you've been seeing on those debate stages is the person I am.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has qualified for December's debate on the strength of strong Iowa polling, but she's got a different problem: Her growth in Iowa has run up against the enthusiasm for Buttigieg. Klobuchar, even more than most Democrats, resents how Buttigieg has positioned himself as a pragmatist after flirting with the party's left.

What curveballs come from the moderators? Seriously, all that time debating Medicare-for-all has shrunk the opportunities to ask candidates about the rest of their agenda, or the world they'd confront as president. This could be an opportunity to ask about the Trump administration dropping America's opposition to Israel's settlements, about the political crisis in Bolivia, about how Warren and Sanders would ban fracking without abandoning the goal of energy independence, about whether mostly-white states should hold the first two contests.

Yes, The Washington Post is co-sponsoring the debate, but the moderators aren't saying a word of it to reporters. We'll just have to watch. (Which you can do at washingtonpost.com starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time; the debate starts at 9 p.m.)

Seventeen Democrats are actively seeking the party's presidential nomination. There will be only 10 on the Tyler Perry Studios stage. The field of seven left-out candidates includes the one who has been running the longest (John Delaney, 844 days) and the one who has been running for less than a week (Deval Patrick, five days).

None of these Democrats are on track to make December's debate. Instead, they're learning the art of dismissiveness. Patrick told reporters in New Hampshire that the tone of the debates made him happier about being left out, a sentiment he repeated a couple of days later in Las Vegas.

“I'm not sure it's something you want to aspire to, because the format is just really, really hard as a means to communicate with the public,” Patrick said.

The former Massachusetts governor would keep campaigning as the debate went forward, as would Colorado Sen. Michael F. Bennet, who had even criticized the DNCs polls and donors debate thresholds at the party's summer meeting in San Francisco.

“I think the debates have been very unhelpful to the party and unhelpful the country,” Bennet said in an interview. “I recognize that this should be part of the process, but I don't think they should be given that kind of weight that they've been given. And I believe that the DNC made huge mistakes in the way they set it up.”

Of all the Democrats left out of the debate, only one, Julián Castro, made the trip to Atlanta, where he'll sit for a Tuesday night interview with Angela Rye. Delaney will be back in Iowa this week for a town hall, as will Marianne Williamson; Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is in New York, then his home state, making himself available to media. Joe Sestak, who has continued to get speaking slots at party events, has no public plans.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

American Action Network, “Clear.” The star of a new seven-figure campaign against impeachment is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and it's because of something she didn't really say. In a CNN interview last week, Ocasio-Cortez largely stuck to the party's preferred messaging: that an impeachment inquiry was necessary because the president seemed ready to pressure more foreign governments to intervene in American elections. “We’re talking about the potential compromise of the 2020 elections,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “This is not just about something that has occurred; this is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.”

Republicans pretended that the “disastrous outcome” was a Trump reelection, and this ad picks up the baton, starting Ocasio-Cortez's quote near the end to blast Democrats for a “partisan impeachment.” From there, it accuses swing-district Democrats of not letting “the voters decide” elections or of working on anything but impeachment.

Jewish Democratic Council of America, “Trump is the Biggest Threat to Jewish Voters.” This spot is ramping up the JDCA's 2020 effort, with a goal of 14 swing-state campaigns. The initial message is the kitchen sink, starting with the 2017 white-nationalist march on Charlottesville, cutting to Trump's “very fine people on both sides” remark (ripped out of context, but not much better in context). Jewish voters are already opposed to Trump, but the ad brackets any positive messages they might hear on Israel with the president's more damaging quotes.

Elizabeth Warren, “Social Security.” The last of the high-polling Democrats to go on the air in Iowa, Warren is getting started with an advertisement for one of her oldest plans: Social Security benefits expansion. It's been a liberal goal for years, endorsed by Warren before the end of her first year in the Senate, and it fits the Warren mold: Explaining it takes very little time and flashes dollar amounts on-screen. Sanders, the other competitor for left-wing voters in Iowa, has lagged with voters over 65; Warren is aiming right for them, though Sanders also supports this policy.

Steve Bullock, “Justice.” The Montana governor introduced himself in Iowa by highlighting his electoral wins — three in a Trump-won state, if anyone hadn't heard. The new ad promises something else: a Bullock Department of Justice that would continue to prosecute Trump officials after the president's term ends. “After I beat Trump, I'll empower prosecutors to follow the evidence all the way to the top,” Bullock says into the camera.

POLL WATCH

South Carolina primary (University of North Florida, 436 likely voters)

Joe Biden: 36%

Elizabeth Warren: 10%

Bernie Sanders: 10%

Tom Steyer: 8%

Kamala D. Harris: 4%

Pete Buttigieg 3%

Cory Booker: 2%

Mike Bloomberg: 1%

Tulsi Gabbard: 1%

Amy Klobachar: 1%

Marianne Williamson: 1%

Andrew Yang: 1%

The first Southern primary, and every other Southern primary that gets polled, finds the same basic story: a solid lead for Biden based on a lopsided advantage with black voters. UNF's first look at the race differs from other recent polls in how it finds Biden narrowly ahead with white voters, with whom he's been relatively weak, in the South and elsewhere. Steyer's strength, which has appeared in other polls of early states with less competition by other candidates, demonstrates just how much he has bought with an ad campaign: To date he has spent around $8.5 million on TV, radio and digital ads targeting South Carolina. That's bigger than the overall ad budget for his competitors.

South Carolina black voters who “haven't heard enough” about candidate (Quinnipiac, 768 likely voters)

Joe Biden: 11%

Bernie Sanders: 12%

Elizabeth Warren: 37%

Kamala D. Harris: 42%

Cory Booker: 45%

Tom Steyer: 47%

Pete Buttigieg: 60%

Amy Klobuchar: 67%

Mike Bloomberg: 68%

Andrew Yang: 72%

Tulsi Gabbard: 77%

Deval Patrick: 80%

Biden's rivals have tended to blow off his South Carolina poll numbers by imagining a day when black voters take them more seriously. As the year has rolled on, that's become a little harder to do; every image of a Buttigieg or Warren rally that's more white than black seems to disprove the point. But this poll, which finds another Biden lead overall, does suggest that South Carolina's black voters are less aware of their alternatives than, say, the average voter in Iowa. While 83 percent of South Carolina whites have heard enough about Warren to form an opinion, just 61 percent of black voters say the same. Two in three white voters have formed an opinion of Buttigieg; just one in three black voters have.

Would you be enthusiastic about voting for each of this kind of candidate? (NPR/PBS, 453 Democratic voters)

A woman: 83%

A gay man or lesbian: 69%

Someone under 40: 62%

A white man: 53%

A socialist: 37%

A business executive: 34%

Someone over 70: 31%

The reasons many Democratic voters are cool on Biden and ready to roll the dice on Buttigieg are laid out here. In 2008 and 2016, Democrats picked history-making nominees, and they liked it. The thought of elevating an elderly candidate or a white man is much less exciting to them; the thought of a businessman who could run from outside the system doesn't click at all.

IN THE STATES

Colorado. Andrew Romanoff, who has emerged as the most serious challenger to John Hickenlooper in the Democrats' U.S. Senate primary, won the support of the Sunrise Movement this week, a climate action group. Whoever wins the party's nomination will challenge Sen. Cory Gardner, widely viewed as the most vulnerable Republican member of the Senate.

“Electing Romanoff to the Senate would be game-changing in fighting the climate crisis,” said Varshini Prakash, Sunrise’s co-founder and executive director, in a statement. “Hickenlooper and Gardner are both in cahoots with the billionaires who got us into this mess.”

Hickenlooper’s problems with climate voters are many; for Sunrise, the final blow was his refusal to sign a popular pledge rejecting support from the fossil fuel industry. “We can’t frack our way out of this crisis,” Romanoff said, “or allow Big Oil to bankroll Congress and block reform.”

Delaware. Jessica Scarane announced a primary challenge to Sen. Chris Coons, who won a special election in a 2010 upset and easily held his seat in the Republican wave of 2014. In a talk with the Intercept, she said she’d focus on Coons’s vote to confirm Trump’s second HHS secretary, Alex Azar, and a head-turning Coons speech from earlier this year where he worried that the Senate’s diversity hurt its ability to come together. “It definitely makes people stop and think and really question why he would believe that,” Scarane said.

Donald Trump. He abandoned plans to ban many flavored varieties of vapes, backing down from a surprise announcement after a coalition of conservatives — and even his campaign manager — warned that going ahead could cost him votes.

Elizabeth Warren. She unveiled a plan to “fight back against white-nationalist violence,"" which includes more funding for investigative work as well as moves to decouple law enforcement and immigration enforcement — an end, for example, to the ""secure communities"" program.

Bernie Sanders. He announced his 4 millionth individual donation on the cusp of the debate, hitting a mark it took several more months to reach during his 2016 campaign.

Cory Booker. He published a New York Times op-ed warning against “dogmatic” opposition to charter schools, an issue that has hurt his campaign, as teachers unions have generally shown more interest in Warren and Sanders.

Mike Bloomberg. The not-yet-official candidate won the endorsement of Columbia, S.C., Mayor Steve Benjamin, a sought-after Democratic surrogate in the state. “He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,” Benjamin told the AP's Meg Kinnard.

Deval Patrick. He told reporters in Las Vegas that he was not “going to ignore Alabama and Arkansas,” where he failed to file in time to make the ballot. “We will have organizations and a presence on the ground to the extent we can.”

Lincoln Chafee. He visited the Libertarian Party's convention in Florida, becoming a member of the party, in what could be a move toward seeking its 2020 presidential nomination.

Kamala D. Harris. She previewed a possible argument against her opponents in an interview with Power 106 FM in Los Angeles, arguing that she’d led on criminal justice reform when other Democrats were timid. “Where were these people, and I’m talking about the people on the debate stage, back in the early 2000s?” she asked. “I was doing the work.”

Joe Biden. He notched another congressional endorsement, from Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a leader of the moderate Blue Dog Democrats. ""I know that Joe can win in tough districts all across this country, giving Democrats a lift up and down the ballot,"" Schrader said. ""And once in office, Joe is the one candidate who has what it takes to work with the other side to get real things done.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Katie Hill had been a Democratic star, a co-president of her freshman class, whose nine-point win in California’s 25th Congressional District told the story her party believed about its suburban future. Her shock resignation did not rattle Democrats too badly; Christy Smith, a new member of California’s state Assembly, jumped into the race, and no other credible candidate emerged to challenge her.

That changed last week, when Cenk Uygur, the brash host of the Young Turks news network, told viewers that he would run for Hill’s open seat. Uygur, who quickly raised more than $300,000, described a race that would prove his brand of left-wing politics could play everywhere — in the Bronx, in flyover country, in the suburbs. (Smith had raised $100,000 in her first 24 hours as a candidate.)

“We’re going to end this fiction that purple districts love corporate donors,” Uygur said in an interview. “You can go with the Republicans, who are going to do tax cuts for the rich. Everybody knows that. You can go for a standard establishment politician, who is going to do as the party dictates. Or you can go with me.”

Uygur, who had co-founded Justice Democrats after the 2016 election, played a role in some of 2018’s upsets, such as the victory of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She defeated the fourth-ranking Democrat in House leadership, but Uygur’s task looked even harder. He did not live in the district and was urging its voters to replace Katie Hill with a tough-talking man. Hill herself had quickly endorsed Smith.

“We flipped the district forever,” Hill said at this past weekend’s Democratic convention in Long Beach, Calif. “We are going to make sure it stays with a woman.”

Since entering the race, Uygur, who has made it his mission to replace “corporate” Democrats, has been under steady attack from Democratic clubs that had been lining up behind Smith. The strategy is simple: Define Uygur, for the voters who don’t know him, as a sexist loudmouth with no business running for Congress.

The opposition research is brief, focused on tweets and video clips from Uygur’s career. Democrats for Israel went after him for a clip where he said that religious fundamentalists “teach their kids things that are loony tunes.” Stonewall Young Democrats attacked a 2010 clip in which Uygur joked about whether it was possible for men to be sexually harassed.

“Uygur's comments reflect more of Donald Trump's hate speech than anything else,” Stonewall Young Democrats wrote. “Uygur's despicable remarks have no place in our discourse.”

These weren’t groups with big clout in the district, but the Simi Valley and Los Angeles Democrats quickly joined in, condemning Uygur over those quotes and sharing a 2017 article about Justice Democrats cutting ties with its co-founder over sexist blog posts he’d written more than a decade earlier.

Uygur’s response, so far, has been contrition about the blog posts — “I’ll never get tired of apologizing for that” — and outrage at the coordinated attacks.

“This is classic oppo research,” he said. “The reason they want to do that is that they don’t want to talk about the issues. When I talk about bribery, I become public enemy number one. My opponent doesn’t want Medicare-for-all, she doesn’t want a Green New Deal, and she doesn’t want to talk about lobbyist money. I call those bribes.”

One of the attacks on Uygur has echoed the Democrats’ presidential primary, as Smith-supporting clubs have highlighted her opponent’s criticism of Barack Obama. As co-host of TYT’s flagship show, Uygur repeatedly went after the 44th president as too timid to deliver on the left’s priorities.

“Yes, I have criticized Barack Obama from the left many times,” Uygur said. “I am not embarrassed about it. I’d do it again. Let’s note the irony that the two lines of attack from oppo is that I’m too conservative and I’m too progressive. Fine. If they think me pushing Obama to do single-payer was too progressive, guilty as charged.”

Smith, who has not engaged with every Uygur accusation, is politically closer to Hill than to Justice Democrats. Hill did not endorse the Green New Deal resolution, though she did endorse Medicare-for-all legislation. In a statement, Smith said that Uygur had already talked himself out of the race.

“None of my opponent’s racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and downright offensive statements are in keeping with the values of our community,” Smith said. “I’m not sure how to rank what is most damning of his commentary, but the most disqualifying to me was the night of the Saugus High School shooting when he boasted about his fundraising totals while I was with grieving families and students. He is not fit to serve anywhere, least of all a district where he doesn’t even live.”

The Campaign

OK BOOMER, LISTEN UP: A majority of young Americans believe President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, according to a study out this morning from the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School.

That includes 52 percent of young Americans and 58 percent of likely general election voters under 30 who want Trump gone. Only 28 percent of likely voters feel differently.

Tribalism : Among young Republicans, an overwhelming majority do not believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office: 82 percent disagreed and 14 percent agreed the president should be impeached and removed.

: Among young Republicans, an overwhelming majority do not believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office: 82 percent disagreed and 14 percent agreed the president should be impeached and removed. But: Only 23 percent of young likely voters — aged 18 to 29 — think the nation is generally headed in the right direction and 58 percent believe that we are on the wrong track.

Big, structural change can't wait. Or maybe it can: While young Americans are largely united in their opposition to Trump, they're more conflicted on how to move forward.

Young voters are divided on the kind of governing philosophy they want to see their favored 2020 candidate embrace — someone who supports “policies that stand a good chance of being achieved as opposed to sweeping changes that will be difficult to carry out” versus a candidate who is proposing “big structural policy changes that address the urgency of the problems that we are facing, even if they will not be easy to carry out.”

“Young Americ a ns in a post-Trump world are divided on the scope of change they seek in Washington. Among likely 2020 young voters, pragmatic has taken the lead in the race between pragmatic and progressive, ” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Institute of Politics. “When looking at young Democratic primary voters, bold structural change is preferred, but not by as much as you might think.”

a ” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Institute of Politics. General election voters: “Among young Americans who are most likely to vote in the November 2020 general election, we find support for the more pragmatic approach, 44% to 40%,"" according to the poll.

“Among young Americans who are most likely to vote in the November 2020 general election, we find support for the more pragmatic approach, 44% to 40%,"" according to the poll. But for those likely to vote in a Democratic primary: “45% of these voters prefer the approach that deals with 'big, structural policy changes that address the urgency of the problems that we are facing, even if they will not be easy to carry out,' compared to 39% who prefer the more pragmatic position.”

“45% of these voters prefer the approach that deals with 'big, structural policy changes that address the urgency of the problems that we are facing, even if they will not be easy to carry out,' compared to 39% who prefer the more pragmatic position.” Maybe Obama is right?: “Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,” former president Barack Obama told a group of wealthy Democratic voters on Friday, per the New York Times's Lisa Lerer. “The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.”

That’s more than the 36% who prefer a candidate who backs big ideas, even if there is a lower chance they would become law,” the Des Moines Register's Brianne Pfannenstiel reports.

Despite the mixed feelings about a political revolution, there is at least one issue overwhelmingly supported by young voters:

That's universal background checks: “More than four-in-five (81%) young Americans polled support 'requiring universal background checks for all gun purchases,' with less than 10 percent in opposition,” according to the IOP study.

“More than four-in-five (81%) young Americans polled support 'requiring universal background checks for all gun purchases,' with less than 10 percent in opposition,” according to the IOP study. The top three issues for young voters: the economy, climate change, and health care.

the economy, climate change, and health care. Among likely general election young voters, 45 percent support eliminating private health insurance and 35 percent oppose it. Fifty-seven percent of likely Democratic primary voters under 30 support eliminating private health insurance.

45 percent support eliminating private health insurance and 35 percent oppose it. Also popular among likely general election voters: 48 percent of likely voters under 30 support “dismantling the electoral college to ensure that the winner of the national popular vote is elected President.”

About the candidates: The cast of septuagenarian candidates are the most popular with young voters. And 94 percent of likely voters are enthusiastic about the choices at hand.

First, second, third place: Young likely Democratic primary voters support Bernie Sanders (28 percent), Elizabeth Warren (22 percent) and Joe Biden (16 percent).

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is lagging in youth support — only 4 percent support his candidacy. Six percent of young voters support entrepreneur Andrew Yang, “the internet's favorite candidate.”

Silver lining: “While a majority of young Americans (56%) tell us they have more fear than hope at this moment about the future of America, we see a marked improvement in the optimism of young Democrats,” according to the report.

“Last fall, before the midterm election, we found that only 22% of Democrats had hope, 76% fear. Today, we find that 35% are hopeful, while 65% indicate that they are fearful.”

“Two-thirds (67%) of Republicans say that they are more hopeful than fearful about America, a statistical tie with the number who said the same one year ago (64%).""

The Investigations

THE WEEK AHEAD IN IMPEACHMENT: On the Hill will be Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, and Tim Morrison, former director of Russian affairs at the National Security Council, among others.

Sondland scoop: Trump's ambassador “kept several Trump administration officials apprised of his effort to get Ukraine to launch investigations that [Trump] would later discuss in a July call with his Ukrainian counterpart, emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show,” the Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus reports. That included White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

More: We previously covered Sondland's precarious legal situation after parts of his testimony were refuted by other witnesses. The diverging story lines — and Sondland's credibility issues — are likely to take center stage at Wednesday's hearing featuring this key witness.

We previously covered Sondland's precarious legal situation after parts of his testimony were refuted by other witnesses. The diverging story lines — and Sondland's credibility issues — are likely to take center stage at Wednesday's hearing featuring this key witness. So far, Sondland has no intention of resigning: “The tension has left a wounded diplomat in charge of managing America’s relationship with the world largest trading bloc amid continuing challenges to his credibility,” our colleagues John Hudson and Michael Birnbaum wrote of the pressure on the former hotelier and real estate maven.

Republicans try a new defense: If 17 other explanations fail, try again. Top Republican lawmakers trotted out an old defense with a new focus on the Sunday shows: Trump did nothing wrong because nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine was ultimately released, the New York Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports.

The shift comes as it will be hard to argue most of the testimony about Trump allegedly trading access and aid for political help is coming from secondhand sources. Sondland talked to the president himself, and NSC aides set to testify were either on the July 25 call or attended meetings where the purported scheme came up.

Key quote: “The Ukrainians did nothing to — as far as investigations goes — to get the aid released,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “So there was never this quid pro quo that the Democrats all promise existed.”

“The Ukrainians did nothing to — as far as investigations goes — to get the aid released,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “So there was never this quid pro quo that the Democrats all promise existed.” The context: As the Times reports, the aid was released “amid a bipartisan uproar on Capitol Hill and revelations of a whistleblower’s report that prompted the impeachment inquiry.”

Meanwhile, Trump attacked another witness who works for his vice president: Trump “continued to take aim at his own administration officials, accusing Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe and Russia, of being a 'Never Trumper,'"" our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, Karoun Demirjian and Douglas MacMillan report.

Williams is set to publicly testify Tuesday. She was on both the July 25 phone call and part of a second conversation between Pence and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelesnky after the hold on the aid was lifted, CNN's Chandelis Duster, Jeremy Diamond and Kaitlan Collins report.

The transcript from her private deposition was released on Saturday: “Williams testified that the call was 'unusual' given the mention of specific investigations,” per our colleagues.

ALSO TESTIFYING: Alexander Vindman (Tuesday): A Soviet emigre and decorated Army officer, Vindman is the top NSC Ukraine expert and was on the July 25 call.

He told lawmakers behind closed doors that Sondland said “after a July 10 meeting with a top Ukrainian official that a long-sought meeting between [Zelensky] and Trump depended upon Ukraine launching specific investigations,” our colleague Aaron Blake previously reported.

Fiona Hill (Thursday): Then a top Russia adviser, Hill worked for John Bolton at the NSC. Hill told lawmakers she was present for the July 10 meeting that exploded when talk of investigations was raised, and later at a small clutch of Ukrainian and U.S. officials that also ended badly.

After the meetings: Bolton urged Hill to go straight to a NSC lawyer and recount what had occurred.

Tim Morrison (Tuesday): A former director of Russian affairs at the NSC, Republicans have claimed Morrison's testimony is a key part of their defense. Morrison ""broke with colleagues in telling House investigators that he heard nothing 'improper' on Trump’s call with Zelensky,” our colleagues Colby Itkowitz, Karoun Demirjian, Michael Kranish and Shane Harris reported over the weekend. Morrison also expressed frustration that Vindman, one of his subordinates, talked to the NSC's top lawyer about the call.

Morrison's testimony will only further embattle Sondland: He told lawmakers that Sondland was, our colleagues write, “acting at Trump’s behest and spoke to a top Ukrainian official about exchanging military aid for political investigations — two elements at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.”

He told lawmakers that Sondland was, our colleagues write, “acting at Trump’s behest and spoke to a top Ukrainian official about exchanging military aid for political investigations — two elements at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.” He also asked for access to the call's rough transcript to be restricted: “Morrison, who left the job at the end of October, said he knew immediately after listening to the call that they needed to keep it under wraps,” our colleagues write. 'I recommended to them that we restrict access to the package,' Morrison said. He said it was the only time he had ever asked the NSC legal team to restrict access.”

The People

Bloomberg apologizes for ""stop and frisk"": ""Ahead of a potential Democratic presidential run, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York ... reversed his longstanding support of the aggressive 'stop-and-frisk' policing strategy that he pursued for a decade and that led to the disproportionate stopping of black and Latino people across the city,"" the Times's Shane Goldmacher reports. “'I was wrong,' [Bloomberg said.] 'And I am sorry.'""

Why this is so significant: ""The speech, [Bloomberg’s] first since he re-emerged as a possible presidential candidate, was a remarkable concession by a 77-year-old billionaire not known for self-doubt: that a pillar of his 12-year mayoralty was a mistake that he now regrets,"" the Times reports.

More on the apology: ""Speaking before the congregation at the Christian Cultural Center, a black megachurch in Brooklyn, [Bloomberg] delivered his apology in the heart of one of the communities most affected by his policing policies, and at a location that nodded to the fact that should he decide to run for president, African-American voters would be a crucial Democratic constituency that he would need to win over.""

That includes the 25% who say he is their first choice, the 14% who name him as their second choice and the 29% who say they are actively considering him,” the Register reports.

“Buttigieg fares best of the four candidates, with 63% saying he’s 'about right,' 13% calling him 'too conservative' and 7% saying he’s 'too liberal,'"" the Register reports. Buttigieg still lags on the question of who can beat Trump: “For Buttigieg, the poll’s front-runner, just 27% of his own supporters say they are 'almost certain' he will beat Trump,” the Register reports.

Trouble ahead?: Buttigieg has frequently faced questions about his lack of support from black voters. A new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll reveals that weakness is still a problem. Of the national sample made up of early and Super Tuesday states just 13 percent of black respondents said they were considering supporting Buttigieg. Among African American voters, Biden was at 71 percent, Warren at 49 percent, Sanders at 41percent, Kamala Harris at 3 percent and Cory Booker at 20 percent.

But, as often happens at her public appearances, a question came up: Would she be willing to serve as vice president?

“I’m happy to do so,” she said, to applause and cheers from the crowd.

AD

Abrams’s Iowa appearance points to the delicate needle she has been threading since her 2018 loss — even as she has declined to run for Senate, saying she wants to focus on voting rights, she has remained a top-tier player in the Democratic Party, frequently mentioned as a potential vice president.

AD

It’s speculation she herself has encouraged. Asked about it during a talk at a church in Washington in September, Abrams said it would be “disingenuous” to say she wasn’t interested in the role. “I’m pretty good at campaigning,” she said, also citing her experience in politics, business and activism.

Her ties to the Democratic leaders, converging on Atlanta this week for the presidential debate, are clear. She is friends with some of the candidates, and has advised others. On Monday, her organization announced that Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang would help contact Georgia voters in danger of being purged from the voting rolls later this week.

AD

Even former president Barack Obama has sung her praises, telling a conference of major Democratic donors recently, “I love me some Stacey Abrams.”

AD

Abrams as vice president would have once seemed far-fetched, said Joel K. Goldstein, a professor at St. Louis University School of Law who studies the vice presidency. Over the past 40 years, he said, vice presidential candidates have had an average of more than 14 years in Congress or as governor.

But, he noted, the 2020 candidates for the Democratic nomination have an unusually wide range of experience. Buttigieg is a two-term mayor of a city of about 100,000. Yang has never served in government. So the fact that Abrams has no national political experience (she served for 10 years in the Georgia state House, including as minority leader) is less of a liability.

AD

Goldstein also said Abrams is the rare political figure that answers honestly, and enthusiastically, that she is interested in being considered for vice president. “I think being as open about it as she is is a way of keeping herself in the conversation,” Goldstein said. He also noted that she is seen as an “impressive” political leader. Along with being a black woman and a Southerner, that could make her an attractive running mate, especially for an older white man.

AD

Abrams’s political future has been the source of much political speculation. For a time earlier this year, Abrams said she considered running for president, accelerating the 2028 timeline she laid out in her book, “Lead from the Outside.”

But in August, she said she would focus on voting rights. Her Fair Fight 2020 organization is helping Democrats in battleground states prepare for the fierce fight over access to the ballot. Virginia and Kentucky, where Democrats claimed major electoral victories this month, were among the states where Fair Fight had a presence.

AD

In Kentucky, Fair Fight gave the party $10,000, the maximum allowed, to print literature left at the homes of targeted voters with a phone number to call for election information. Mary Nishimuta, executive director of the state party, said the No. 1 question the hotline got was “Where do I go to vote?” Nishimuta said Abrams’s efforts contributed to the increased turnout, which helped Democrat Andy Beshear defeat Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.

AD

Abrams’s passion for this issue comes from personal experience. Her own gubernatorial election was plagued with numerous irregularities — hours-long waits because of malfunctioning voting machines, new voters being turned away because their registrations had been suspended, local officials tossing out absentee ballots because of problems with signatures — that may have prevented thousands of voters from casting ballots.

Republican lawmakers and conservatives dismiss her as a “sore loser” for refusing to concede last year’s election. They say what she calls voter suppression is merely an attempt to root out fraudulent activity in the process. The Georgia ethics commission launched an investigation into Abrams’s 2018 campaign, alleging “unlawful coordination” with third-party groups. Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams’s top aide, counters that the investigation is politically motivated and aimed at intimidating groups representing voters of color.

AD

Abrams says it doesn’t matter who’s running if their supporters can’t cast a ballot or have their votes counted. Her work toward that goal is more important than her own presidential run right now, she said.

AD

“My decision was premised on where I could make the strongest impact and where I could add the deepest value,” Abrams said. “My responsibility is not to be the person on the [debate] stage but to be the person who is making sure that no matter where you live in the United States that your right to vote is protected.”

Abrams is also trying to make sure people participate in next year’s census, particularly people of color, young people and the poor. Toward that goal, she created a group called Fair Count and recruited her sister, Jeanine Abrams McLean, to help lead it.

AD

McLean, who holds a doctorate in ecology, evolution and behavior, has worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on public health and population-based research. When Abrams asked her how best to “count everybody in the census in Georgia,” McLean did some studying and came back with ideas and strategies.

AD

Their plans include identifying and providing Internet access and tablets in community sites, such as churches, restaurants and barbershops, where people gather and might be motivated to go online and fill out census forms.

“I joke with her that she is the only person who could get me to quit my good government job to come and do this,” McLean said.

AD

Asked what she thinks her sister should do next, McLean laughed. “Stacey does what Stacey wants to do. . . . At end of the day, she makes her own decisions.”

Abrams has said that will include another run for office down the road.

National party leaders heavily courted her to run for Senate against freshman Republican Sen. David Perdue, up for reelection next year. Abrams demurred, saying that while she respects the role of the Senate, she no longer thinks the legislative process is the best place for her to affect change.

AD

Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, who followed Abrams’s decade in the Georgia legislature, including six years as Democratic leader in the state House, thinks Abrams will make another bid for governor in 2022. Running for Senate would have complicated that plan.

AD

Then, of course, there’s still the specter of Abrams running for vice president in 2020. Shelton Stromquist, a retired historian and activist who with his wife and several friends came to hear Abrams in Iowa City, said she would be an asset to any nominee.

“She’s obviously deeply principled. She can generate enthusiasm,” he said. He described the Georgia governor’s race as a “trial by fire.”

“It was a national race in some ways,” he said.

His wife, Ann Stromquist, said Abrams displayed “wisdom” by sitting out the presidential primary and focusing on voting rights.

“I think what she’s doing now is more important,” she said."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wants the federal government to mandate three months of paid family leave for workers. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to guarantee workers twice as long.

The issue is one of many separating the economic programs of the two 2020 presidential candidates vying to become the liberal standard-bearer. And where they diverge, Sanders mostly stakes out the more aggressive position.

That’s one of the revelations from The Post’s new survey of the candidates’ positions on economic issues as they prepare for their fifth debate, set for Wednesday and co-hosted by The Post.

Sanders stands alone on several issues.

He is the only candidate in the field, for example, to say the Federal Reserve’s interest rates are too high. “The Fed must become a more democratic institution that represents the needs of ordinary Americans and small businesses, not Wall Street billionaires,” he told The Post’s Kevin Uhrmacher. He said he “disagreed with the Fed’s decision to increase rates from 2015-2018. Raising rates should be done as a last resort, not to fight phantom inflation.”

Warren joined seven of her more moderate competitors — including former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — in declining to weigh in on monetary policy, saying the Fed should operate independently of political pressure. “The Fed’s mandate is to balance long-term price stability with full employment,” she said. “I respect the Fed’s independence in setting interest rates to achieve these two goals.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., at a fundraiser for the Nevada Democratic Party on Sunday. (AP Photo/John Locher)

Sanders is also the only contender to endorse a federal jobs guarantee, telling Uhrmacher that “in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, every American who wants to work should have the right to a decent-paying job through a federal jobs guarantee program.”

Warren said she’s open to it, pointing to her support for a proposal from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to launch a pilot program that would provide grants for jobs guarantee programs. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) noted she is a co-sponsor of Booker’s bill.

Sanders also wants to cancel all student debt and impose a national rent control cap — two more positions that make him unique in the field. Warren’s student debt plan wouldn’t offer relief to households pulling in more than $250,000, or the top 5 percent of earners. Booker, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro also propose offering relief based on household income.

Of course, Sanders and Warren line up elsewhere, notably on the broad strokes of tax policy. Both have proposed wealth taxes. And both favor returning the corporate tax rate to 35 percent, along with Buttigieg, Castro, and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Most of the rest of the field proposes raising it from its current 21 percent but leaving it lower than the old rate: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wants it at 25 percent; Bennet and Biden would lift it to 28 percent; Gov. Steve Bullock (D-Mont.) backs a 31 percent rate.

— Optimism powers stock rally. WSJ's Akane Otani: ""Stocks’ latest records are a testament to one thing: Investors aren’t worried about a recession happening soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 28,000 in the very last minute of Friday’s trading session, capping off an otherwise quiet week with its first thousand-point milestone since July.

""Much of the stock market’s dash higher in recent months has been powered by shares of economically sensitive companies like banks, manufacturers and oil producers. That rally, along with the relative underperformance of traditionally safe sectors like utilities and consumer staples, has suggested that money managers are turning more optimistic about the economic outlook.""

— Fed review finds stable financial system. CNBC's Jeff Cox: ""Stock market prices remain high compared to earnings, and corporations, including those at the bottom end of the credit spectrum, continue to run up debt. But financial stability overall remains solid, according to a report Friday from the Federal Reserve. The central bank’s biannual financial stability report also indicated that prices are high for commercial real estate and farmland. It also noted a few incidents where market liquidity deteriorated.

""In all, though, there are no areas identified as posing a threat to the larger stability of U.S. financial markets and the economy. In fact, the report found that the biggest threats come from abroad, through Brexit and other geopolitical risks.""

— FedEx eliminated its tax bill. The New York Times's Jim Tankersley, Peter Eavis and Ben Casselman: ""In the 2017 fiscal year, FedEx owed more than $1.5 billion in taxes. The next year, it owed nothing. What changed was the Trump administration’s tax cut — for which the company had lobbied hard... But it did not increase investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as [CEO Fred] Smith said businesses like his would.

""Nearly two years after the tax law passed, the windfall to corporations like FedEx is becoming clear. A New York Times analysis of data compiled by Capital IQ shows no statistically meaningful relationship between the size of the tax cut that companies and industries received and the investments they made. If anything, the companies that received the biggest tax cuts increased their capital investment by less, on average, than companies that got smaller cuts.""

FedEx's Smith responds. In a statement, Smith called the report ""distorted and factually incorrect"" but didn't say how. And he issued a challenge: ""I hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax.""

— Lighthizer’s moment of truth: “Like a more polished version of his freewheeling boss, [U.S. Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer has busted precedent, bent rules and left a trail of discomfited traditionalists in his wake. No constituency has been more unsettled than corporate America,” my colleague David J. Lynch reports.

“Now Lighthizer and the business community are awkward partners in a rush to seal two major prizes: a North American trade accord, which awaits lawmakers’ approval, and an unfinished deal with China.”

Look who’s on his call sheet: “In September alone, Lighthizer met or spoke by phone with the leaders of Apple, General Motors, Cisco, Dow, UPS, Boeing, Honeywell and Arcelor Mittal, as well as representatives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable, according to his office calendar on the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) website.”

— Morgan Stanley says trade tensions should ease in 2020: “Morgan Stanley forecasts that global growth will recover from the first quarter of 2020 onward as trade tensions and monetary policy ease, reversing the downward trend of the past seven quarters,” CNBC’s Spencer Kimball reports.

“‘Easing trade tensions (the key factor in the global downturn) will reduce business uncertainty and make policy stimulus more effective,’ the bank’s analysts said in its global outlook for 2020. The firm projects global economic growth of 3.2% next year, compared to 3% in 2019. Much depends, however, on the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks and whether or not the Trump administration’s next round of tariffs, scheduled for Dec. 15, go into effect. If those tariffs are activated, global growth in the final quarter of this year will slow to 2.8% and a recovery will be delayed until the third quarter of 2020, according to Morgan Stanley.”

“Xerox had offered HP $22 per share in its takeover bid for the company. The bid consists of 77% cash and 23% stock, or $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox share for each HP share. HP announced in October that it will cut between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by the end of fiscal 2022 as part of a broader restructuring plan that it estimates will save $1 billion a year.

“Aramco cannot sell its shares directly to investors in the United States and other markets, as the initial public offering (IPO) will be restricted to Saudis and those foreign institutions permitted to invest in the kingdom’s stock market. The oil giant said it plans to sell 1.5% of the company, or about 3 billion shares, at an indicative price range of 30 riyals to 32 riyals, valuing the IPO at as much as 96 billion riyals ($25.6 billion) and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.”

— Warren, AOC side with Taylor Swift in fight against Carlyle Group: “Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a new ally in her battle against private equity: Taylor Swift,” CNBC’s Lauren Hirsch reports.

“Swift on Thursday wrote a Tumblr post in which she detailed her frustration over the terms of the sale of her back catalog to music managers Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta and private equity firm Carlyle Group. Swift, who protested the initial sale, claimed Braun and Borchetta’s company, Big Machine Label Group, is placing restrictions on her ability to play her older music on televised performances. She pleaded for support from her fans and let them know where they could direct their anger.”

And private equity punches back : “The private equity industry, under attack from [Warren], is defending itself with the Popeyes chicken sandwich,” Politico’s Zachary Warmbrodt reports. “The industry is touting the fast food craze as a success attributable to private equity-backed Popeyes as it tries to ward off a bipartisan Capitol Hill assault led by Warren, including legislation that would increase the firms’ liability for the companies they take over. The industry is also facing two congressional probes and a House hearing this week as lawmakers raise concerns about its impact on workers and consumers.”

""This hearing will provide a deluge of negative headlines for the entire private equity industry, but our sense is that the policy conversation is more political than practical at this stage.""

— The fight over the F-35: “The U.S. military’s most expensive weapons program seemed to be under threat from all sides at a recent hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, as skeptical lawmakers called out supply chain problems that have meant only a third of the Pentagon’s F-35 fighter jets are capable of carrying out all the missions for which they were built,” my colleague Aaron Gregg reports.

“And some lawmakers criticized the terms of Lockheed’s arrangement with the government, saying overly generous intellectual property agreements threaten to lock Lockheed into a wasteful long-term profit machine with limited accountability. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) threatened to hold up a multibillion-dollar contract if fundamental questions aren’t resolved, suggesting there should be a broader sea change in how military agencies work with weapons builders.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was the final presidential candidate fully on board with a swift and complete Medicare-for-all overhaul of the U.S. health-care system.

No longer.

Like the other Democratic contenders, Warren has somewhat softened her position on the sweeping — and what some term radical — Medicare-for-all system envisioned by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). On Friday she released a proposal to first adopt a public option approach similar to what the race’s moderates are calling for — a marked shift from her previous calls for quickly moving all Americans to government-backed health insurance.

Warren introduced her proposal this way:

As president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and will protect people with pre-existing conditions. And in my first 100 days, I’ll take executive and legislative action to reduce health care costs and improve coverage. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

Next, in my first 100 days, I’ll use the same process Mitch McConnell used to try and kill the ACA to bypass the filibuster and create a true #MedicareForAll option—more generous than one proposed by any other campaign—to begin the transition to #MedicareForAll. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

This #MedicareForAll option will be open to everyone and includes all the health care benefits of #MedicareForAll. It will be immediately free for nearly half of all Americans, including all children under 18 and anyone with income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

By the end of my third year, I’ll fight to pass legislation to complete the transition to #MedicareForAll. Once millions have experienced the full benefits of a #MedicareforAll option and compared it to the corrupt and wasteful system we have today, the people will demand it. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

This latest Warren health-care proposal comes ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday, which could bring more politically tricky discussions of how to expand health insurance to around 30 million people who still lack it. Democrats spent considerable time in past debates wrangling over the pros and cons of a single-payer approach of uprooting existing coverage and raising taxes in the interest of ensuring everyone has a comprehensive and affordable set of benefits.

Many of the candidates started their campaigns enthusiastically backing the Sanders bill, which would replace all private health coverage with a generous public plan over a four-year transition period. But one by one they’ve qualified their support, releasing proposals to preserve a role for private coverage or private insurers to ensure people don’t get involuntarily dropped from plans they might want to keep.

Warren was the lone candidate to still support the Sanders plan without any qualifications. But now she’s tacitly acknowledging Medicare-for-all’s political difficulty by proposing that people should be allowed — but not forced — to enroll in government health insurance as a first step toward universal health coverage.

Under her proposal published Friday in a Medium post, Warren says in her presidency’s first 100 days she would push Congress to expand Medicare to people age 50 and older and create a Medicare-type plan anyone else could buy, subsidized more heavily than the private plans available in the Obamacare marketplaces. Democrats would have to win a majority in the Senate so they could use the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to bypass Republican support.

“By the end of my first 100 days, we will have opened the door for tens of millions of Americans to get high-quality Medicare for All coverage at little or no cost,” Warren wrote.

this warren thing is gonna rip the medicare for all movement apart. this sucks — guy fieri 2020 campaign manager (@libbycwatson) November 15, 2019

Warren insists she’d pass Medicare-for-all in the third year of her presidency. But there’s reason to believe this could be even more unlikely than if she pushed for it right out of the gate (and passing it immediately would already be a tall order, if Republicans retain control of the Senate in 2020).

For one thing, getting more Americans covered via incremental methods – like a public option – would reduce the population of uninsured people and therefore the urgency for passing something as drastic as Medicare-for-all. That's a point made by hard-left provider groups that have enthusiastically backed Medicare-for-all. Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program, told my colleague Annie Linskey that a two-step approach could halt momentum for Medicare-for-all and even torpedo it.

“Doing this in stages creates a political danger and an opening for opponents to prevent further progress,” Gaffney said. “The longer the rollout, the more political risk.”

And consider this. The president’s political party typically loses seats during midterm elections – meaning Warren would likely have even fewer Democrats in Congress to help her pass Medicare-for-all during her third year in office.

“It’s a clear shift for the senator from Massachusetts as she attempts to ward off criticism that her single-payer health plan is unrealistic substantively and toxic politically,” Annie writes. “Warren for months had signaled a full-throated embrace of Medicare-for-all, and this new approach significantly tempers that urgency.”

Other candidates have also taken detours from the Medicare-for-all highway. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wants to preserve a role for private insurance companies to sell Medicare plans to everyone. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg wants to let anyone buy into Medicare without unraveling the system of employer-sponsored coverage – an approach that looks remarkably similar to what former vice president Joe Biden has proposed.

In short, each of the top Democratic candidates now has his or her own, nuanced proposal for reaching universal health coverage. And as the primaries approach, they’re increasing beating each other up over those differences. Warren was on the receiving end over the weekend.

“Having discovered how problematic her embrace of Medicare-for-all has become….Senator Warren is now trying to muddy the waters even further,” said Kate Bedingfield, communications director for former vice president Joe Biden.

Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) said she was “backtracking.” Buttigieg spokeswoman Lis Smith accused her of trying to “paper over a very serious policy problem.”

Sanders didn't directly criticize Warren's proposal, but his campaign did tweet a statement from National Nurses United, which is pushing for Medicare-for-all and has endorsed him:

""We know that there are ample opportunities for politicians to compromise on Medicare for All, and we know, having worked with Senator Sanders before, that he won't compromise when people's health is at stake."" –Deborah Burger, Co-President @NationalNurses pic.twitter.com/YlBfQD89iM — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 15, 2019

Comments from former President Barack Obama, via the New York Times's Lisa Lerer:

Obama's comments were meant to reassure establishment Democrats about the strength of the field. But they also offered an implicit critique of Sanders & Warren, as well as proposals once widely considered to be left to the liberal fringes of the party. https://t.co/bbjPvWl4Yr — Lisa Lerer (@llerer) November 16, 2019

Sanders also appeared to indirectly contrast his approach with Warren's by adding a line to his stump speech yesterday, Annie reports.

“Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all ­single-payer legislation,” he said Saturday in East Los Angeles.

Warren is likely to face many questions during Wednesday’s debate about her tempered new approach. In response to reporter questions over the weekend, she rejected the idea that her proposal acknowledges single-payer health care isn’t feasible in the United State.

“I don’t see it that way at all,” Warren said. “The way I see this, is that there is an intense need right now for relief.”

But here's an intense need for Warren: To seize back support from Iowa caucusgoers. While Warren led the Iowa polls in September, a new poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN released Saturday night showed her in a three-way tie for second place with Biden and Sanders, while Buttigieg surged ahead of the pack. The poll shows Buttigieg with 25 percent support and Warren, Biden and Sanders all with about 15 percent support.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

AHH: President Trump has backed off of a ban on most flavored e-cigarettes, worried about the consequences such as lost jobs and angry shop owners and customers that could hurt his 2020 reelection bid.

The ban had already been cleared by federal regulators, and a Nov. 5 morning news conference was planned. But the night before, Trump refused to sign a “decision memo,” our Post colleagues Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley report.

A senior administration official told them the president “didn’t know much about the issue” and that he’d been pushing for it because of Melania and Ivanka Trump, who were urging him to take action on the issue.

“As he had done so many times before, Trump reversed course — this time on a plan to address a major public health problem because of worries that apoplectic vape shop owners and their customers might hurt his reelection prospects, said White House and campaign officials,” they write. “He also believed job losses tied to the ban would cost him as he sought to trumpet economic growth. It was the latest example of the chaotic way policy is made — and sometimes unmade — in a White House where the ultimate decider often switches gears after making a controversial vow, whether on combating gun violence, pulling troops from Syria or promising to deliver an Obamacare replacement plan.”

Trump had been rattled by the blowback to the possible ban, and the president was now upset with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who had taken a lead on the plan.

Now, it’s unclear whether a policy will be unveiled at all.

OOF: The Trump administration announced a rule mandating that hospitals publicly disclose the discounted rates they negotiated privately with insurers. It’s a rule that was “resisted for months by a broad swath of the health-care industry, hospitals,” our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.

The requirement, which will go into effect in January 2021, means that hospitals will have to reveal rates for hundreds of services that can be scheduled in advance, including X-rays and Caesarean sections.

“For decades, hospitals, insurance companies, lobbyists, and special interests have hidden prices from consumers so they could drive up costs for you. And you had no idea what was happening. You’d get bills that were unbelievable and you have no idea why,” Trump said in Friday remarks at the White House.

The administration has been expecting a legal challenge to the rule from the hospital industry — and the two biggest hospital trade groups, the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals, said they will challenge it.

“In a new twist, the administration is also proposing to require most health plans that Americans get through their jobs to disclose the rates they negotiate with hospitals and doctors in their insurance networks, as well as the amounts they pay to doctors out-of-network,” Amy writes. “…Taken together, the pair of actions — one a final rule, the other in draft form — is part of President Trump’s 2020 electoral strategy to capi­tal­ize on polls that show health care ranks among Americans’ top domestic concerns. Public opinion surveys consistently show that consumers are looking to government especially to ease the burden of escalating out-of-pocket costs.”

OUCH: Researchers have found that invasive heart procedures such as stent insertions and bypass surgery are no more effective for individuals with stable heart disease than drugs.

But the study did find that such procedures were “measurably” better than pills at reducing chest pain during exercise, our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.

The closely anticipated federally funded study results “suggest that invasive procedures, stents and bypass surgery, should be used more sparingly in patients with stable heart disease and the decision to use them should be less rushed, experts said.”

“The ISCHEMIA trial shows that an early invasive approach does not protect patients against death or the overall chance of a heart attack, but does effectively relieve chest pain — the more chest pain a patient has, the more likely they are to benefit,” said Elliott Antman, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who was not involved in the research.

“The new study was designed to finally settle the question of whether stents are better for patients with stable heart disease — and some physicians said it could change how tens of thousands of people are treated in hospitals, transform how cardiologists talk with patients about their options and save hundreds of millions of dollars in health-care spending each year,” Carolyn writes.

MEDICAL MISSIVES

—Telemedicine centers are filling a gap left by the shrinking availability of hospitals and doctors in rural areas across the country, where choices are sometimes between having a doctor help you from a screen or not at all.

One center, Avera eCare, provides remote care for 179 hospitals in 30 states. But they’re operating out of cubicles. “They wear scrubs to look the part of traditional doctors on camera, even though they never directly see or touch their patients,” our Post colleague Eli Saslow writes in this deeply reported piece. “They respond to more than 15,000 emergencies each year by using remote-controlled cameras and computer screens at what has become rural America’s busiest emergency room, which is in fact a virtual ER located in a suburban industrial park.”

Emergency telemedicine is increasing in the poorest, sickest and most remote regions in the United States, as ER patients have spiked by 60 percent in the past decade in rural areas, and the number of physicians and hospitals in those areas has decreased by up to 15 percent.

“In less than a decade, the virtual hospital has grown from a few part-time employees working out of a converted storage room into one of the country’s most dynamic 24-hour ERs, where a rural health-care crisis plays out on screen,” Eli writes. “Each month the monitors show an average of 300 cardiac episodes, 200 traumatic injuries, 80 overdoses and 25 burns. There are patients suffering from heat stroke in South Texas and frostbite in Minnesota — sometimes on the same day. There are drowning deaths in summer, gunshot wounds during hunting season, car accidents on icy roads, and snakebites in spring.”

— Two out of three Americans say marijuana use should be legal, the Pew Research Center has found.

The survey data shows just 8 percent say it should not be legal at all, down from the 15 percent who said it should be completely illegal in 2016, our Post colleague Christopher Ingraham reports.

The Pew survey found 78 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Republicans support legalization. It also found 59 percent of Americans say it should be legal for both medical and recreational use, and 32 percent said it should be legal just for medical use.

“As with many political issues, the public’s preferences on marijuana are well to the left of where the policy currently stands,” Christopher writes. “The plant remains illegal for all purposes under federal law. Recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states plus D.C., in most cases because of voter-approved ballot initiatives. Most other states have some form of medical marijuana law, although in many cases there are severe restrictions on the conditions for which medical marijuana can be used, or on the types of marijuana that can be used.”

INDUSTRY RX

— Most of the advertisements spreading false information about vaccines on Facebook were funded by two groups, including the World Mercury Project, a group led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports.

“Researchers said the results surprised them. Much of the anti-vaccine content posted on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter may appear to be organic, grass-roots discussions led by neighborhood groups and concerned parents, said David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University and one of the authors of the study,” Lena writes. “…The study was conducted before Facebook changed its policies around anti-vaccine advertising, but researchers said it provides a look at how the platform has been used to spread misinformation.”

False claims have spread online and social platforms in recent years as more parents delay or otherwise choose not to get their children vaccinated. Kennedy’s World Mercury Project has pushed the false message that “vaccines are contributing to a vast array of childhood illnesses.”

Of the ads assessed for the research, there were 145 that were anti-vaccine and 83 groups that promoted them. The study found “five groups accounted for 75 percent of anti-vaccine messages. The top two were the World Mercury Project and Stop Mandatory Vaccination.” Stop Mandatory Vaccination is led by Larry Cook, who calls himself an “advocate for natural living.”

“We can’t wait until we have a candidate to do this work,” said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive of Acronym, a politically active nonprofit supporting Democrats. “There’s so much we can and need to be doing right now that is going to help strengthen the position of our candidate when we have one.”

The efforts reflect a growing anxiety about Trump’s unprecedented reelection machine, which has been raising money since he was elected president. Along with the Republican Party and pro-Trump committees, his reelection effort has raised more than $752 million — a record sum.

He has been forging ahead even as Democratic presidential hopefuls continue to focus their firepower on each other, and as the Democratic electorate remains far from decided on a candidate heading into 2020.

The Democratic National Committee is focused on preparing for its role in the general election, when it can work in lock-step with the nominee to raise and spend lots of money quickly.

Wealthy donors are giving to an array of nonprofits and super PACs, ranging from the anti-Trump “resistance” groups that formed in 2017 to the big-money groups amplifying the liberal message, like Priorities USA Action.

Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC and nonprofit effort, has launched a $100 million ad campaign largely targeting battleground-state voters.

Another group of Democratic donors plans to direct at least $25 million to about a dozen nonprofits, mainly in swing states, to help defeat Trump. And Way to Win, a coalition of liberal donors, plans to invest $50 million to help boost Democratic turnout in the South and Southwest.

“Donors are ready. They’re fired up. They’re ready to play big in 2020,” said Tory Gavito, president of Way to Win.

The efforts come as Trump continues to raise money from loyal online donors fueling his campaign by giving $25 or $50 at a time, as well as wealthy backers directing millions of dollars per fundraising event.

Already, his campaign has spent more than $26 million on Facebook and Google advertising. That is more than the combined digital spending by four leading Democrats: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, according to data by Bully Pulpit Interactive.

Trump’s head start has also allowed him to buy pricey ad slots as a show of force — such as running a television ad during Game Seven of the World Series, and a banner video ad on the YouTube homepage on the first day of the Democratic debate earlier this year.

“We’ve never seen spending this early and at these levels in a presidential election by an incumbent. The incumbent has always had the bully pulpit advantage, but this is different,” McGowan said.

Bradley Beychok, president of American Bridge, said last week in a memo to supporters that Democratic gains with white working-class voters have been important to the party’s victories since 2016.

“With reports indicating that white working-class turnout could surge even higher in 2020, targeted persuasion efforts towards this group will be even more critical over the next year,” he wrote.

Steve Phillips, a major Democratic donor and founder of Democracy in Color, a San Francisco-based organization, said he is worried that too much is being spent on digital ads in swing states. He contends that more money should be spent motivating reliable Democrats and minority communities he says were overlooked in 2016.

“The whole pie is way too small compared to Trump. Then, what they’re spending on, what the slices of the pie are, are wrong,” Phillips said. “That’s the dominant reality of the progressive spending of this moment.”

These differences were on display at a private conference last week in Washington of Democracy Alliance, a network of donors who contribute at least $200,000 to certain liberal groups.

Hundreds of donors, party leaders and operatives gathered at the swanky Mandarin Oriental hotel for closed-door meetings on the spread of misinformation online, the need for more voter outreach and education, and Trump’s ability to excite and expand the conservative base.

“We can’t afford one iota of complacency,” Democracy Alliance president Gara LaMarche told attendees, according to remarks obtained by The Washington Post.

Donors said those discussions helped inform their investments. For example, Leeds said she wants to help rebuild the Democratic digital and data infrastructure, which she sees as a major gap with Trump.

The DNC is also mobilizing. It has launched Organizing Corps 2020, a program to organize staff in eight swing states to help make sure that once there is a nominee, the party can quickly flood those states with trained staff.

DNC officials said they are meeting their fundraising goals. As of October, the DNC raised $65.5 million, and an affiliated committee that raises money for the national and state parties raised another $5.6 million, federal filings show.

The DNC raised $45.1 million as of October 2015, filings show.

“The DNC is one of the only entities that will be able to coordinate directly with the eventual nominee’s campaign, so we are making historic, early investments,” said David Bergstein, the DNC’s director of battleground state communications.

Democratic donors assert that the nominee will eventually have plenty of money to take on Trump, and that they are heartened by the small-dollar donor enthusiasm fueling primary candidates."

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: President Trump is spurning the women who have his ear to side with male advisers as he kowtows to a pressure campaign orchestrated by corporate interests.

Perhaps the most effective path to persuade Trump to change his mind on public policy is to convince him that he would lose support from his base, whether it’s true or not. This is how the National Rifle Association, which should be viewed first and foremost as a trade association for the gun industry, got him to break his promise to impose “very meaningful background checks” for gun purchases after the massacres in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.

This same dynamic helps explain why the president has backed away from the crackdown he announced two months ago on most flavored e-cigarettes. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Sept. 11 that first lady Melania Trump feels “very, very strongly” that government must quell the youth vaping epidemic that has ensnared 5 million teenagers. “She’s got a son,” Trump said, referring to his wife. (Barron, 13, is his son, too.) “We can’t allow people to get sick, and we can’t have our youth be so affected,” the president added.

Trump was also pressed to act by his daughter Ivanka Trump, a senior adviser in the White House, and encouraged by Kellyanne Conway, the most powerful woman in the administration who is not a member of the president’s family. Conway, who managed Trump’s 2016 campaign in the home stretch after Paul Manafort was pushed out over his sketchy financial dealings in Ukraine, argued that doing something about flavored e-cigs could enable the president to regain ground he’s lost among suburban moms who have traditionally voted Republican.

But on Nov. 4, the night before details of the ban were all set to be formally unveiled during a news conference, the president balked. My colleagues Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley scoop that Trump refused to sign a one-page decision memo during a flight to a campaign rally in Kentucky that would have taken candy, fruit and mint flavors off the market within 30 days. Three officials familiar with the discussions said that Trump has grown upset with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who took the lead in rolling out a plan to address the vaping crisis. “He didn’t know much about the issue and was just doing it for Melania and Ivanka,” a senior administration official explained.

“Late last week, more than a dozen White House officials met to try to find a way forward,” Josh and Laurie report. “Given Trump’s record of zigzags, some officials cautioned the president could reverse course again. Or he might back some ban on flavored e-cigarettes that exempts vape shops. Others said the White House might pursue a different tack altogether by endorsing legislation that would raise the minimum federal age for buying tobacco products to 21 from 18 … Some bet the anti-vaping effort is dead, though, especially because the administration could argue the youth vaping problem has been greatly eased by Juul Labs’ recent decision to stop selling its popular mint-flavored nicotine pods. ‘It’s going to go the way of guns,’ predicted one adviser…”

The president changed his mind after he was warned repeatedly that banning flavored e-cigarettes would anger vaping enthusiasts and could depress turnout for him in the 2020 election. Trump’s reelection campaign manager Brad Parscale told the president that moving against flavored e-cigarettes could backfire with his base. “A Washington Examiner op-ed written by a pro-vaping conservative activist, Paul Blair, with the headline ‘Banning flavored e-cigarettes might cost Trump reelection,’ was circulated at the White House and considered the ‘opinion of the campaign,’ according to a White House official involved in the process,” Michael Scherer, Josh, Laurie and Neena Satija reported last month. “Trump advisers [in the White House] compiled a binder of evidence supporting the idea of strong new measures to combat youth vaping, according to a person familiar with the effort. The documents included public polling, supportive editorials, statements from the scientific and medical community, and statements from elected leaders.”

It’s unclear if Trump read that binder. But Trump’s helicopter flew over hundreds of people who gathered on the Ellipse to protest his flavor ban when he departed the White House on Nov. 9 to watch the Alabama-LSU football game. He also saw a pro-vaping protest outside his rally in Dallas last month. And there was a social media campaign that used the hashtag #IVapeIVote. This effort has included many hallmarks of what’s known as an “Astroturf” campaign.

-- Many former Trump aides have been cashing in on the industry’s panic. Juul has been paying Trump world insiders like Josh Raffel, a former spokesman for Jared Kushner; Johnny DeStefano, a former counselor to the president; and Rebeccah Propp, former director of media affairs for Vice President Pence. Brian Ballard, the Florida lobbyist who represented Trump’s businesses there and worked on the president’s 2016 campaign, has been paid seven figures by Reynolds American, which owns an e-cigarette company. Jeff Miller, a lobbyist with close ties to Pence, reported that his firm was paid $60,000 by Altria from July through September 2019 to lobby on the executive branch on issues related to the regulation of tobacco products, including “WH Administration Initiative to ban flavored vaping products.”

Conservative activist Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, has played a starring role in ginning up opposition to the implementation of what Trump announced, but he’s declined to say whether he or his group have received money from the e-cigarette industry.

-- The bigger picture: Trump continues to campaign like a populist even as he governs like a plutocrat, and the republic continues its descent toward corporatocracy. In 2016, he promised to be a different kind of Republican and said he’d check corporate power. He said he was incorruptible because he was so rich that he didn’t need to take campaign contributions. Among other things, Trump said he would end the carried interest loophole and go after hedge funds. In practice, he’s done the opposite.

The president’s signature legislative achievement was the tax cut bill in 2017, which has proven to be even more of a giveaway for the rich than analysts feared while exploding the national debt. A damning story on the front of Sunday’s New York Times highlighted how FedEx – which spent $10 million on lobbying that year, mostly on tax policy – went from owing $1.5 billion in taxes to nothing the following year. But the shipping company did not increase total investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as its chief executive Fred Smith said companies would do if they got the lower corporate rate. Instead, the story explained, FedEx used its windfall to reward shareholders with more than $2 billion in stock buybacks and dividend increases. Smith called the story an “outrageous distortion of the truth” and challenged the publisher of the Times to a debate on federal tax policy, but he did not specify any errors.

-- Four were killed and six were injured during a shooting at a backyard football-viewing party in Fresno, Calif. Katie Shepherd reports: “Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley told reporters near the scene that officers arrived to find ‘several individuals’ dead on the back lawn. Unknown suspects fled before police arrived at the home, shortly after 8 p.m. Sunday evening ... All the victims were ‘Asian males’ between 25 and 35 years old, Fresno Police Deputy Chief Michael Reid told the Bee. ‘Thank God that no kids were hurt,’ Reid said, the Associated Press reported. Police declined to discuss what kind of weapon was used or any potential motive.""

IMPEACHMENT LATEST:

-- Trump tweeted this morning that he will “strongly consider” testifying in writing as part of the impeachment inquiry. The president said he might take up House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on a suggestion she made over the weekend on CBS. Trump also claimed the rules of the inquiry had been “rigged” against him by Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who has summoned four witnesses to appear before his panel on Tuesday. “Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” Trump said in tweets that described Pelosi as “Nervous Nancy” and “crazy.” (Follow our liveblog for more updates throughout the day.)

-- Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Trump administration officials who provided information to the anonymous whistleblower about the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine “exposed things that didn’t need to be exposed.” Felicia Sonmez, Karoun Demirjian and Douglas MacMillan report: “‘This would have been far better off if we would’ve just taken care of this behind the scenes,’ Johnson said in an interview on NBC News’s ‘Meet the Press.’ ... 'We were trying to convince President Trump.’ … Trump on Sunday continued to take aim at his own administration officials, accusing Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe and Russia, of being a ‘Never Trumper.’ … Williams is expected to testify publicly on Tuesday. Her closed-door testimony, which was released Saturday, suggests that the Office of Management and Budget had clamped down on Ukraine aid more than two weeks earlier than has been previously reported. …

“The comments by Trump and Johnson also come amid intensifying scrutiny of the actions of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, [who is expected to testify on Wednesday and one of eight people scheduled to appear in public hearings this week]. According to testimony released Saturday, a former White House national security official told House investigators that Sondland was acting at Trump’s behest and spoke to a top Ukrainian official about exchanging military aid for political investigations — two elements at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he believes Sondland will face pressure this week when he’s asked about inconsistencies between his testimony and that of other recent witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. …

""On ‘Fox News Sunday,’ House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) dismissed the witnesses who have testified, ... arguing that ‘they were not all Trump administration folks.’ ‘They’re Schiff’s witnesses,’ Scalise said. … When pressed by host Chris Wallace on the fact that most of the witnesses are part of the Trump administration, Scalise responded that ‘there are a lot of people who worked in the Trump administration who have very countering views to that and they’ve not been allowed to come forward.’ ... In an interview with CBS News’s ‘Face the Nation’ ... Pelosi declined to weigh in on the timeline for a potential impeachment vote, saying only that there may be further depositions over the Thanksgiving holiday and that there may be ‘a decision or maybe they have more hearings’ once Congress returns.”

-- Tim Morrison, the former top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council, testified that it was his understanding Sondland spoke to Trump directly about half a dozen times between July 16 and Sept. 11. Trump has increasingly tried to distance himself from Sondland. During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said Morrison’s testimony is ""alarming.” From CNN: “‘Well, of course, all of that is alarming. As I've said from the beginning, I think this is not OK. The President of the United States shouldn't even in the original phone call be on the phone with the president of another country and raise his political opponent,’ [Turner said]. … Turner also addressed tweets Trump posted last week during former Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch's public testimony before the panel. … ‘It's certainly not impeachable, and it's certainly not criminal and it's certainly not witness intimidation. It certainly wasn't trying to prevent her or wouldn't have prevented her from testifying, she was actually in the process of testifying. But nonetheless, I find the President's tweets unfortunate,’ the congressman said.”

-- Sondland kept several Trump administration officials apprised of his effort to get Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens, including Mick Mulvaney and Rick Perry, according to emails obtained by the Wall Street Journal: “The emails reviewed by the Journal show that three days [after the July 10 meeting], Mr. Sondland urged Mr. Morrison to schedule the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky before Ukrainian parliamentary elections on July 21. ‘Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give Potus assurances of ""new sheriff"" in town. Corruption ending, unbundling moving forward and any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently,’ Mr. Sondland wrote. Mr. Morrison replied that he was ‘tracking.’ On July 19, a day before the president was initially scheduled to speak to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Sondland emailed a group of administration officials including Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Perry to say that Mr. Zelensky was prepared to assure the president that he would open investigations. ‘I talked to Zelensky just now. He is prepared to receive Potus’ call,’ Mr. Sondland wrote. ‘Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will ""turn over every stone.""’ He added that Mr. Zelensky was eager for the call to take place before the parliamentary elections. Mr. Mulvaney responded: ‘I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.’”

-- When Sondland stepped in to mediate, things really went off the rails. From the Daily Beast: “Ukrainian officials arrived at the White House on July 10 expecting something approaching normal. They were in Washington for a scheduled meeting with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton with a plan to propose a new path for U.S.-Ukrainian relations under the umbrella of energy and security cooperation. All seemed to go well—until [Sondland] stepped in. ‘That’s when things really went off the rails,’ one person in the room said. … Sondland raised his voice several times in his attempt to persuade the Ukrainian officials sitting across from him, including Andriy Yermak, a close aide to Zelensky, and Zelensky’s then-national security adviser Oleksandr Danylyuk. One individual told The Daily Beast that Sondland ‘got very emotional,’ adding that ‘there was lots of yelling.’ Another individual called the meeting ‘erratic’ and said the Ukrainians began to ignore Sondland and instead turned to Fiona Hill, who ran the National Security Council’s Russia desk at the time, for clarification on Washington’s messaging. Sondland has previously tried to claim he didn’t know much about a quid pro quo with Ukraine—until he suddenly told Congress he now recalls the deal. But the details of Sondland’s behavior in the Ward Room underscore the intensity in which the EU Ambassador advocated for the investigations into [Joe] Biden and Burisma.”

-- An overwhelming 70 percent of Americans think Trump’s request to a foreign leader to investigate Biden was wrong, an ABC News/Ipsos poll found

-- Trump’s public schedule for this week seems designed to keep him distracted from the televised hearings as much as possible. From Axios: “Trump's schedule for the coming week shows him governing, promoting U.S. jobs and highlighting the arts and pop culture. On Tuesday, as Democrats question Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Trump will be meeting with his Cabinet. On Wednesday, as Democrats grill [Sondland], Trump will he visiting Apple's manufacturing plant in Texas. And on Thursday, after Democrats question [Hill], Trump will be presenting the national medals of arts and humanities.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Hundreds of leaked Iranian intelligence reports offer a detailed portrait of how aggressively Tehran has worked to embed itself into Iraqi affairs and the unique role of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force. From the Times and the Intercept: “The unprecedented leak exposes Tehran’s vast influence in Iraq, detailing years of painstaking work by Iranian spies to co-opt the country’s leaders, pay Iraqi agents working for the Americans to switch sides and infiltrate every aspect of Iraq’s political, economic and religious life. Many of the cables describe real-life espionage capers that feel torn from the pages of a spy thriller. Meetings are arranged in dark alleyways and shopping malls or under the cover of a hunting excursion or a birthday party. Informants lurk at the Baghdad airport, snapping pictures of American soldiers and keeping tabs on coalition military flights. Agents drive meandering routes to meetings to evade surveillance. Sources are plied with gifts of pistachios, cologne and saffron. Iraqi officials, if necessary, are offered bribes. …

“The leaked cables ... detail the extent to which Iraq has fallen under Iranian influence since the American invasion in 2003, which transformed Iraq into a gateway for Iranian power, connecting the Islamic Republic’s geography of dominance from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. … Many of Iraq’s foremost political, military, and security officials have had secret relationships with Tehran, according to the documents. … According to the reports, after the American troop withdrawal in 2011, Iran moved quickly to add former C.I.A. informants to its payroll. … In interviews, Iranian officials acknowledged that Iran viewed surveillance of American activity in Iraq after the United States invasion as critical to its survival and national security. … The roughly 700 pages of leaked reports were sent anonymously to The Intercept, which translated them from Persian to English and shared them with The Times. … The Intercept communicated over encrypted channels with the source, who declined to meet with a reporter. In these anonymous messages, the source said that they wanted to ‘let the world know what Iran is doing in my country Iraq.’”

-- Protests in Iran continued after the country’s supreme leader endorsed a government decision to cut fuel subsidies and warned demonstrators against clashing with security forces. Erin Cunningham reports: “In a televised address, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he supports the measure to push up gasoline prices and ration supplies, a move designed to raise funds for cash handouts to the poor. The abrupt decision, announced Friday, sparked demonstrations in about two dozen locations across the country as residents already grappling with soaring inflation called on the government to reverse the hike. In towns and cities across Iran, drivers abandoned vehicles on highways and protesters blocked roads and set tires and buildings alight. Some demonstrators clashed with baton-wielding security forces, officials said, and at least one protester and a police officer were killed.""

-- Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong were surrounded by riot police this morning inside a university campus, setting the stage for a bloody fight. Casey Quackenbush, Anna Kam, Gerry Shih and Tiffany Liang report: “Police blocked exits to try to coax exhausted protesters out of the Polytechnic University on Monday after a night of clashes with students. When some attempted to leave, officers forced them back with tear gas and rubber bullets and made dozens of arrests. As night fell, and with explosions and black smoke emanating from the grounds, police repeated demands for the demonstrators — some of whom have been there for days — to surrender. At rallies across the city, people expressed support for the trapped students. … Some 500 to 600 students remain trapped, said Derek Liu, head of the university’s student union. PolyU’s president, Jin-Guang Teng, in a video statement urged students to hand themselves in. …

""In a new setback for [Hong Kong leader Carrie] Lam, Hong Kong’s highest court ruled Monday that the government’s use of a British colonial-era emergency ordinance to ban face coverings at public gatherings was unconstitutional. Lam had introduced the measure to aid police in identifying protesters and effectively expand powers of arrest. Lam visited an injured police officer in the hospital on Monday, but she did not make public remarks, and her office did not respond to a request for comment. In a message on Facebook later, she condemned protesters and urged them to obey police.”

-- Uighur activists called the leaked Chinese documents revealing the government’s plan to systematically detain millions of ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region another form of genocide. Lateshia Beachum reports: “The more than 400 pages of documents, leaked, according to the Times, by a member of the Chinese political establishment, included internal speeches by President Xi Jinping and other officials, information about the surveillance and control of the Uighur population and internal investigations on local officials. … The papers confirm reports that more than 1 million people have been detained in internment camps as the Chinese government seeks to strip Uighurs of their identity and indoctrinate them into being secular and loyal party supporters. Xi still told party members in secret speeches that religious extremists should be treated with ‘absolutely no mercy,’ the Times reported. The documents included a script for officials to follow when explaining to students returning to the region why their parents had disappeared, the Times reported. The World Uyghur Congress called China a ‘country with concentration camps’ in a retweet.”

-- Few Uighurs have been able to escape the widespread surveillance, and even fewer are able to make it to the U.S. in search of asylum. Now, an Uighur family living in Northern Virginia has caught the attention of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Emily Rauhala and Anna Fifield report: “Zumrat Dawut, her husband, Imran Muhammad, and their three children got out. Dawut, who survived internment and an unwanted sterilization, fled first with her family to her husband’s native Pakistan. The next leg of their journey took them to a basement apartment in Virginia outside Washington. They spent their first American summer strolling through shopping malls and savoring Popeyes’ halal fried chicken. ‘Here in U.S., people have human rights. People live like real human beings,’ Dawut said. They have applied for asylum in the United States. They want, desperately, to stay. But their case — which recently caught [Pompeo’s] attention — raises tough questions for the Trump administration as it vows to take a harder line on China while simultaneously seeking a trade deal with Beijing. The United States has roundly condemned the internment camps in Xinjiang. But will it take in those who endured Beijing’s chokehold on the region and somehow reached the United States?”

-- Russian troops took command of a U.S. air base in northern Syria. From CBS News: “The Russians are playing up the takeover of the Kobani airfield as a victory. The former U.S. airbase that served as the main logistical hub for America's fight against ISIS, now with the Russian flag flying above it. The Russians moved in just a day after U.S. forces moved out, leaving behind barracks, beds, abandoned medical supplies and the skeleton of a gym with weights removed, to render it useless. The same can't be said of the runway, however. An American-made landing strip now under Russian management. It's the second major military expansion in this region in as many days, after Russia announced it had opened up a new helicopter base in Qamishli, which, like Kobani, is also on the Turkish border.”

-- A planned prisoner swap between the Afghan government and the Taliban meant to restart peace talks between the insurgent group and the U.S. has been delayed. Susannah George reports: “The emergence of significant snags early on highlights the difficulty of getting the two sides back to the negotiating table. The Taliban has long refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government. The swap would have freed two university professors in exchange for three high-profile militants linked to the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani announced the deal on live television last week, saying it would help bring ‘peace and stability’ to Afghanistan ... But days after Ghani’s announcement, none of the prisoners have been released and the government and Taliban officials are trading blame. Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Ghani, blamed the Taliban for the delay, tweeting Saturday that the insurgents ‘failed to observe the conditions’ of the swap and caused ‘the disruption of the exchange process.’ He did not elaborate.”

-- Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced the U.S. and South Korea postponed a joint military exercise, bowing to saber-rattling by North Korea. From the AP: “The move comes even as Japan’s defense minister, whose country feels threatened by repeated North Korean missile launches, told Esper ‘no one could be optimistic about’ changing the North’s behavior. … Esper insisted the postponement was not a concession to North Korea but rather an attempt to ‘keep the door open’ to diplomacy to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons.”

-- North Korea responded to a tweet by Trump that hinted at another summit with Kim Jong Un by saying it has no interest in giving Trump further meetings unless it gets something in return. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan said Washington must discard what his government sees as “hostile” policies in order to keep negotiations alive. (AP)

-- While Trump stands by, the world’s tyrants are trying to make the world safe for dictatorship, warns The Post’s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt: “The United States is retreating, almost apologizing for ever having thought about promoting democracy. Everyone from Rand Paul to Bernie Sanders and many in between agrees we should stay home and mind our business. But the result is not a world in which every country is free to go its own way. Instead, the world’s tyrants — while still complaining about color revolutions and U.S. interference — roam far and wide, promoting their ideologies and their corporations, bullying and buying and burrowing and shooting their way to influence. Russia and China, the loudest conjurers of imaginary CIA pro-democracy plots, have become the world’s most active underminers of democracy beyond their borders.”

-- Last year, after CIA Director Gina Haspel was nominated for her position, White House counsel Don McGahn suggested she withdraw due to her role in the “enhanced interrogation” program, which he argued could kill her confirmation chances. Trump disagreed, telling advisers that he supports ""torture."" From Axios: “Trump actually liked this aspect of Haspel's resume, according to three sources who spoke to the president at the time. In fact, Trump told aides that Haspel's support for ‘torture’ or ‘waterboarding’ (Trump uses these words interchangeably in his private conversations) was an asset, not a liability. Trump told advisers that he asked Haspel her opinion on whether waterboarding works. In Trump's telling, Haspel replied to him that she was ‘100%’ sure it works, a source who spoke to Trump about it told me. ‘He seemed impressed with how sure she was about something so controversial,’ the source said. ‘That she did not bat an eye, did not sugarcoat it, that it works.’”

-- Friday news dump follow-up: “Trump sides with war criminals,” Kori Schake, a veteran of George W. Bush's national security team, writes in the Atlantic: “Trump has exercised his authority to intervene in three cases involving war crimes, on the side of the alleged war criminals. He pardoned one serviceman who was convicted of heinous crimes, and another awaiting trial for heinous crimes. He also reversed the demotion of a Navy SEAL convicted of taking trophy pictures with an enemy corpse. All were brought to justice by their fellow servicemen and women; each prosecution relied on testimony from servicemen in the same units who witnessed the war crimes and reported them to military superiors. This makes Trump the first commander in chief in memory to pardon American servicemen for violent crimes committed in uniform. The justification can be found in a statement Trump made in 2016: ‘You have to play the game the way they are playing the game.’ That is, the U.S. should operate the way terrorists operate.”

-- The Trump administration’s immigration jails are packed, but deportation numbers are lower than in Barack Obama's presidency. Abigail Hauslohner reports: “According to the latest snapshot of ICE’s prisoner population, from early November, nearly 70 percent of the inmates had no prior criminal conviction. More than 14,000 are people the U.S. government has determined have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture if deported. Though [Trump] has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his first term, his administration lags far behind President Barack Obama’s pace of deportations. Obama — who immigrant advocates at one point called the ‘deporter in chief’ — removed 409,849 people in 2012 alone. Trump, who has vowed to deport ‘millions’ of immigrants, has yet to surpass 260,000 deportations in a single year. And while Obama deported 1.18 million people during his first three years in office, Trump has deported fewer than 800,000. It is unclear why deportations have been happening relatively slowly.”

-- England’s Prince Andrew hoped that an interview with the BBC about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein would put an end to a scandal that has dogged him for years. It didn’t go quite as planned. Karla Adam reports: “An example of some of the exchanges: Andrew: ‘Do I regret the fact that he [Epstein] has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.’ Emily Maitlis: ‘Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.’ Andrew: ‘Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m being polite.’ The interview was undoubtedly a coup for the BBC, which was in talks with the palace for nearly a year to secure it, and for Maitlis, the journalist whose interrogation has won widespread acclaim. But royal watchers described the interview as ill-judged and excruciating. ‘I expected a train wreck,’ tweeted Charlie Proctor, editor of the Royal Central website. ‘That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.’ …

""Andrew told Maitlis that he flew to New York in December 2010 to end his friendship with Epstein, because breaking it off over the phone would have been a ‘chicken’s way of doing it.’ At the time, Epstein had served time in prison for child sex offenses. Andrew said he stayed at Epstein’s home for four days because it was ‘convenient.’ Andrew was also criticized for what he didn’t say. He expressed no concern for Epstein’s victims. ‘Not One Single Word of Remorse,’ read a front-page headline on the Mail on Sunday. … Andrew was repeatedly grilled about Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, who has said that Epstein groomed her to have sex with the prince on three occasions. He said he had ‘no recollection’ of meeting her and ‘categorically’ denied having sex with her.”

Gov. John Bel Edwards celebrates his reelection victory on Saturday night in Baton Rouge, La. (Matthew Hinton/AP)

2020 WATCH:

-- Back-to-back losses in key governors’ races send additional warning to Trump ahead of 2020. David Nakamura reports: “When Kentucky’s Republican governor lost his bid for reelection two weeks ago … the president and his allies brushed it off by declaring that Trump had nearly dragged an unpopular incumbent across the finish line. On Sunday, a day after another Trump-backed GOP gubernatorial candidate fell in Louisiana, the president and his surrogates barely mounted a defense. In a barrage of 40 tweets and retweets by Sunday evening, Trump didn’t mention Eddie Rispone’s loss to incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), even though the president had held two campaign rallies in the state in the 10 days before the election aimed at boosting his chances. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel — who had publicly praised Trump after the Kentucky elections in which the GOP won five other statewide races — also was mum on Louisiana....

“Trump campaigned hard for Rispone and Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) … turning their races into something of a referendum on his own standing … ‘What Trump did in Louisiana was increase voter participation. While he increased the pro-Trump turnout, he also increased the anti-Trump turnout. That’s kind of the lesson here,’ said Ron Faucheux, a nonpartisan political polling analyst based in New Orleans. … In Louisiana, state GOP leaders had pleaded with the president to personally get involved in the race, and Trump held a rally with Rispone in Bossier City on Thursday during which the president cast the contest in personal terms. Referring to Bevin’s loss in Kentucky, Trump complained that the media pinned the defeat on him. ‘So you’ve got to give me a big win, please,’ he told the crowd.”

-- Top Republicans are second guessing Trump's decision to waste so much time in Louisiana. From the Times: “Mr. Trump carried Louisiana by 20 points in 2016, so the outcome of the governor’s race carries no implications for his own re-election, the balance of power in Congress or the president’s policy agenda. And the moderate Mr. Edwards has relentlessly cultivated Mr. Trump, showing up at the White House every chance he gets — so it was not even an opportunity to defeat a critic. Some of the president’s advisers were mystified, therefore, that the White House would repeatedly send him to a state irrelevant to his re-election for a candidate he scarcely knows … after they had just been scalded in their attempt to rescue Mr. Bevin in another safely red state. … Still, the main instigator for the president’s involvement in the races, many Republicans said, was Mr. Trump himself, who simply craves the adulation of his supporters and is singularly focused on notching victories, no matter the details. He is even more eager to flex his political muscle in the face of impeachment, and has surrounded himself with several aides who either defer to his whims regardless of the neon-flashing signs of risk before them, or know little about politics. … People close to Mr. Trump … said he viewed the campaigns he had weighed in on mostly as opportunities for gratification.”

-- Louisiana’s outcome was only possible because of a spike in black turnout. From CNN: “In heavily African American, Caddo, East Baton Rouge and Orleans parishes, turnout was up about 15% to 30% compared to last month's Louisiana ‘jungle primary.’ … Parishes in the rest of the state saw a lower increase in turnout. This trend in the early vote data suggested that African Americans were going to make up a larger share of voters in the runoff than they did in October's jungle primary … One key to turning out black voters is to not merely rely on Trump as a foil. The fact is that Edwards won in Louisiana not because of Trump but because Edwards has been a popular governor with an approval rating north of 50%. He had a strong appeal to the black community in particular. What Edwards demonstrated on Saturday is that Trump is not everything when it comes to elections.”

-- National Democrats are increasingly worried that their presidential nominating contest will drag deep into next summer. Michael Scherer reports: “That scenario is prompting the campaigns, several of which have signed up veteran delegate counters, to begin strategizing for a protracted nomination slog, with some even playing out scenarios for dealmaking in the weeks leading up to the Democratic convention in July. … Broadly, the Democrats’ fear is that the surging energy and turmoil in their party, and its passion to defeat Trump, may be leading to fracturing rather than unity. Some in the party worry that could hamper its ability to defeat Trump, although others argue that a tough primary will strengthen the eventual nominee. Three party veterans, who have each worked on delegate strategies in past presidential contests … described the landscape as unprecedented. … The operatives point to other factors, including the increasing role of small-dollar fundraising, which allows candidates to stay in longer, and the diminished role of superdelegates, whose function was to rally the party around a nominee if needed. They also point to Sen. Bernie Sanders’s medical and political rebound from a heart attack, which suggests he could battle Sen. Elizabeth Warren for liberal voters for months. One delegate counter admitted to concluding it is now 'more likely than not' that no one gets a majority of pledged delegates, largely because of Sanders’s continued strength and the likelihood that he will continue to campaign even if he is trailing late in the primary contest.”

-- Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg apologized for his stop-and-frisk policy ahead of his likely presidential run. Sean Sullivan and Michael Scherer report: “Bloomberg expressed regrets at a predominantly black megachurch he has visited many times, telling congregants he didn’t understand the full effects on African American and Latino communities quickly enough and should have curtailed the program sooner. ‘I’m sorry that we didn’t,’ Bloomberg said. ‘But I can’t change history. However, today, I want you to know that I realize back then, I was wrong.’ The speech served as one of the clearest indicators yet that the billionaire businessman might soon join the crowded Democratic primary. Bloomberg has filed paperwork to run in Alabama and Arkansas and has mapped out a strategy that would largely bypass the four earliest nominating states. Instead, he would focus on later contests of note, including those in Southern states with large black populations. Bloomberg’s attempt to confront one of his biggest potential liabilities reflects the ongoing shift in the Democratic Party on issues of race, criminal justice and police violence. Voters and activists are increasingly demanding their leaders take firmer stances against discrimination by law enforcement and reject tough-on-crime policies that were more widely accepted decades ago.”

-- In Las Vegas on Sunday, Biden drew some groans from a crowd of Democrats when he said he wants more research done on marijuana and suggested that it may be a “gateway drug.” Teo Armus reports: “But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released on Nov. 14. … ‘The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,’ Biden said. ‘It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.’ Answering an audience question, Biden indicated that he is not opposed to the drug entirely. He supports the use of medical marijuana and would decriminalize possession of the drug, he said, adding that he wants individual states to make decisions on recreational use.”

-- A new CBS poll found support for Pete Buttigieg in Iowa has tripled since September and risen seven points since last month. “In addition to his gains in Iowa and New Hampshire, Buttigieg has picked up support in the aggregate 18-state poll. CBS News recontacts voters for this study, and most of Buttigieg's current supporters reported a different first-choice candidate last month, primarily Warren. … The poll asked voters what Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg could do to become a first choice among voters who are considering them. The top answer was convincing voters they could defeat Mr. Trump, which outpaced all other reasons tested, such as convincing voters that their policies would work or that they could handle the job of president.”

-- In case you missed it: Buttigieg rocketed to the top of the Des Moines Register’s Iowa poll that came out on Saturday night. “Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals [Biden, Sanders and Warren], who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind ... [Warren] led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. [Biden], who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. [Sanders] also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”

-- Warren pitched her new, more flexible approach to government-run health care during a swing through Iowa this weekend as her campaign struggles to move beyond a problematic issue for her. Annie Linskey reports: “On Friday, she announced she will push Congress to pass legislation that allows all Americans to opt into the existing Medicare program in her first 100 days in office and take executive actions even sooner to lower the price of prescription drugs. She wouldn’t push for full-blown Medicare-for-all until the third year of her term. … Her new pitch also seems designed to assuage voters worried that her earlier approach would force 150 million people off their private insurance. … That has prompted Sanders to adjust, adding a line to his stump speech that contrasts Warren’s approach to his. ‘Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all single-payer legislation,’ he said Saturday in East Los Angeles. ...

“Several who attended Warren’s town hall ... were relieved by her new approach. ‘I like the shift,’ said Elizabeth Texley, 43, of Cedar Rapids. Texley works with seniors and hasn’t yet decided who she will support in the upcoming caucuses. ‘The goal of Medicare-for-all is great,’ she said. ‘But I don’t think you’re going to be able to get everybody on board right now.’ Warren’s new proposal, Texley added, ‘does make it easier to support her.’”

-- Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, promoting the Nevada caucuses, said Iowa and New Hampshire are not diverse enough states to provide Democrats with insight into how a candidate will fare across the country. From the AP: “‘I don’t think it matters what happens in Iowa or New Hampshire because those states are not representative of the country anymore,’ the longtime Nevada senator said. Nevada is the third state to weigh in but the first that looks like the rest of the country, with a sizeable Latino population and significant groups of Asian American and black voters … Reid, who says he won’t endorse until after Nevada’s Feb. 22 caucuses, said it’s too early to start counting candidates out of the race and he’s impressed with the packed field. Reid said he thinks that Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”

-- Democrats in California are wondering if it’s time for Kamala Harris to finally drop out of the race. From Politico: “In the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”

-- An Obama-era Pentagon official who attacked Trump over his affinity for Russia is entering the crowded New York Democratic primary field to succeed retiring Rep. Nita Lowey (D). Anne Gearan reports: “Evelyn Farkas, a national security analyst and author, will announce her campaign Monday and attend a candidate forum not far from Chappaqua, the New York town where she grew up. She is the fifth Democrat to launch a bid to represent the safely Democratic 17th District, located in the affluent northern suburbs of New York City. But Farkas said her experience helps her stand out. ‘There isn’t another candidate who has my experience and qualifications,’ she said in an exclusive interview Sunday. Farkas served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in charge of policy toward Russia, Ukraine and neighboring countries under [Obama]. She was an early critic of Trump’s relationship with [Putin].”

House investigators released the transcript of his deposition on Monday night. (Jose Luis Magana/AP)

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: David Holmes, the political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, testified that he “vividly” remembers his July 26 lunch at a restaurant in Kyiv because he’d “never seen anything like this.”

After ordering a bottle of wine, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland used his unsecured cellphone to update President Trump on his meeting that morning with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Holmes said he could hear Trump say, “So he’s going to do the investigation?” And he said Sondland responded, “Oh yeah, he’s going to do it.” The ambassador explained to the president that Zelensky, whom Trump spoke with the day before, “loves your a--,” according to the transcript of Holmes’s deposition released last night by House impeachment investigators.

But it’s what purportedly transpired after this two-minute conservation that’s most problematic for both Sondland and Trump. According to Holmes, the E.U. ambassador volunteered that the president cared more about the investigation of Joe Biden that Rudy Giuliani was pursuing than anything having to do directly with Ukraine.

Holmes explained that he asked Sondland, point blank, whether it was true that the president “doesn’t give a s--- about Ukraine” because “it had been very difficult for us to get the president interested in what we were trying to do in Ukraine.”

“Ambassador Sondland agreed that the president did not give a s--- about Ukraine,” Holmes said under oath. “I asked why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated, the President only cares about ‘big stuff.’ I noted that there was ‘big stuff’ going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. And Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant ‘big stuff that benefits the president,’ like the ‘Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.’”

-- Holmes, a career Foreign Service officer, has agreed to testify publicly on Thursday at 9 a.m. alongside Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council official who also provided damaging closed-door testimony against Sondland. The 213-page transcript suggests that Holmes is poised to offer a gripping narrative for the benefit of a television audience.

“This was an extremely distinctive experience in my Foreign Service career,” Holmes said. “I’ve never seen anything like this, someone calling the President from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language. There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly.”

-- House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) questioned Holmes about his bluntness with Sondland. “I’m not proud of my language,” the diplomat answered. “But the informal tone of the lunch and the language I had heard him using in his call with the president, we were just sort of, you know, two guys talking about stuff, and it seemed to me that was the kind of language that he used.” Holmes recalled that Sondland’s exact words were: “Nope, not at all, doesn’t give a s--- about Ukraine.”

Waiters were coming and going as all this played out on the outdoor terrace at SHO, a central Kyiv restaurant. Holmes said he was surprised a presidential conversation so candid would take place on a cellphone since the Russians own or hold significant stakes in the mobile networks and government officials should always assume that they’re being monitored. Acting ambassador Bill Taylor revealed the July 26 call between Trump and Sondland during his testimony last week.

-- Holmes’s sworn testimony links Trump himself much more directly to the efforts to coerce Ukraine to investigate Biden at a time when the former vice president was leading in polls. It also further undermines another favorite GOP talking point: that Trump put assistance on ice because he was sincerely concerned about corruption and the rule of law in Kyiv. The rough transcript of Trump’s initial April call with Zelensky, released Friday, revealed that the president didn’t even broach corruption during that conversation, despite the White House’s readout from the time that said he had raised the issue. “I think the Ukrainians gradually came to understand that they were being asked to do something in exchange for the meeting and the security assistance hold being lifted,” Holmes testified.

Not to mention, the president’s reported disregard for Ukraine’s future is a boon for the Kremlin’s propaganda efforts in Russia’s ongoing invasion in the east and its occupation of Crimea.

-- It stands to reason that Sondland would know about Trump’s interest in Biden. The rough transcript of the July 25 call shows Trump mentioning his political challenger to Zelensky. But Sondland insisted under oath that he didn’t know the president was interested in securing a Biden investigation until later. “Sondland did not disclose any conversation with Trump while in Kyiv in his testimony or in the follow-up statement,” Glenn Kessler notes. “In his initial deposition, he said: ‘Again, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son. Nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.’

“Sondland in his testimony indicated that he did not understand until late in the game that administration requests that Ukraine investigate the Ukrainian gas company Burisma – where Hunter Biden was a director – were related to the Biden family. He expressed ignorance about statements and tweets made by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, making that connection. ‘I became aware of his [Giuliani’s] interest in Burisma sometime in the intervening period, but I never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens until the very end,’ Sondland said. ‘I heard the word ‘Burisma,’ but I didn't understand that Biden and Burisma were connected.’”

-- Tomorrow morning, Sondland will get a chance to clear up these and other discrepancies during his own televised testimony. Holmes’s deposition gives him more to answer for when he’s in the hot seat. The Portland, Ore., hotelier already significantly revised his testimony regarding the existence of a quid pro quo after other officials gave conflicting accounts of his role.

-- Trump claimed last week that he doesn’t have any recollection of the July 26 conversation, and the White House refuses to turn over call logs that could illuminate the extent of the president’s Ukrainian-related contacts. The president has begun distancing himself from Sondland. “I hardly know the gentleman,” Trump said on Nov. 8. The president has previously taken this tack with Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and others who he apparently concluded had outlived their usefulness to him.

-- Sondland previously sought to minimize his contacts with Trump. “I think I’ve spoken with President Trump – and this is a guess – maybe five or six times since I’ve been an ambassador,” he said during his deposition. “And one of those I recall was a Christmas, ‘Merry Christmas,’ and it was zero substance.”

But former National Security Council senior director Tim Morrison said it was his understanding that Sondland had a lot of conversations with the president. “Ambassador Sondland believed and at least related to me that the president was giving him instructions,” Morrison testified, adding that Sondland related to him that he was “discussing these matters with the president.”

-- Democrats also released the transcript last night from Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale’s appearance. Hale, the top career official at Foggy Bottom, revealed that Mike Pompeo spoke with Giuliani by phone on March 28 and March 29 as officials in the department tried to get a statement of support for then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as the president’s personal lawyer participated in a smear campaign against her. Hale said Yovanovitch was doing an “exceptional” job.

-- Pompeo continues to defy a subpoena and refuses to turn over records that could validate – or undercut – some of the most damning witness testimony about Trump’s conduct. Sondland turned over communications from his personal devices to the State Department, but State won’t share them with investigators.

-- Holmes also testified that aides to Energy Secretary Rick Perry were “very aggressive in terms of promoting an agenda” in Ukraine, as well as in “excluding embassy personnel from meetings without giving explanations.”

-- He will return to the Capitol on Thursday with a deep reservoir of credibility because he has a proven track record of speaking truth to power. “Holmes won an award in 2014 for raising concerns about then-President Barack Obama’s policy toward Afghanistan, where Holmes had served,” Anne Gearan reports. “The ‘constructive dissent’ honor recognizes mid-level State Department officials who use an internal process to flag problems they observe, which in his case was about how Obama had, in his view, muddied decision-making on Afghanistan and Pakistan. … A rising star in the Foreign Service, Holmes had a string of sought-after jobs before landing as the senior political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. In addition to the National Security Council — a high-stress, high-profile plum — Holmes also was picked for a prestigious job working for the State Department’s No. 3 official during the Obama administration.""

-- Two more-junior staffers who were sitting at the table might also be able to corroborate Holmes’s testimony if Sondland disputes his allegations: Suriya Jayanti arranged Sondland’s schedule in Kyiv, and Tara Maher, a political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, where Sondland is based.

-- Holmes said he also told others in the embassy: The encounter was so “extraordinary” that Holmes immediately told his direct supervisor at the embassy. “You’re not going to believe what I just heard,” he recalled telling her. “I would refer back to it repeatedly in our morning staff meetings,” he added. “We'd talk about what we’re trying to do. … And I would say, 'Well, as we know, he doesn't really care about Ukraine. He cares about some other things.’”

-- House investigators have now released all but two deposition transcripts. Mark Sandy from the Office of Management and Budget testified on Saturday and hasn’t come back to the Capitol to approve the text. Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, has not completed a review of his transcript either.

HAPPENING TODAY:

-- Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, European affairs director at the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe and Russia, are testifying this morning. They are the first public witnesses who heard Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky. This afternoon, lawmakers will hear from Kurt Volker, a former Trump administration envoy to Ukraine, and Morrison, the former top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council.

-- Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, plans to testify about his alarm at Trump’s request that Ukraine investigate his political opponents. “But Republicans are also seizing on Vindman’s testimony as an opportunity, signaling that they plan to try to discredit one of the key witnesses in the inquiry by questioning his motives and his loyalty to the president,” Tom Hamburger, Carol Leonnig and Rachael Bade report. “Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) suggested in a letter released Monday that Vindman fits the profile of ‘a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch [who] have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and … react by leaking to the press and participating in the ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, remove him from office.’ Vindman’s lawyer, Michael Volkov, called Johnson’s assertion ‘such a baseless accusation, so ridiculous on its face, that it doesn’t even warrant a response.’”

-- “Trump and many of his allies have seized on a core defense strategy by attacking career public servants who are testifying as witnesses in the probe and spreading disinformation about their motives as ‘unelected bureaucrats,’” Elise Viebeck and Isaac Stanley-Becker report.

-- Vindman is the second of three immigrants scheduled to testify. (My Big Idea from Friday explains the significance.)

-- Volker will modify his testimony and plans to say this afternoon that he didn’t know the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations. From the Times: “Mr. Volker will say that he did not realize that others working for Mr. Trump were tying American security aid to a commitment to investigate Democrats. His testimony, summarized by a person informed about it who insisted on anonymity to describe it in advance, will seek to reconcile his previous closed-door description of events with conflicting versions offered subsequently by other witnesses. … Mr. Volker will modify his account as well, addressing disparities between his testimony and that of other witnesses. While he has been lumped together with Mr. Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry as ‘the three amigos’ working on behalf of the president, he plans to try to distinguish his role, insisting that he was not part of any inappropriate pressure and that he was unaware of certain events that he has only now learned about through other testimony. ...

""Mr. Volker plans to say that he never knew that Mr. Sondland told the Ukrainians that the aid and investigations were linked and that he did not know that Mr. Zelensky was being pressed to appear on CNN and announce that he would open the investigations Mr. Trump sought. He also will seek to explain why his description of a key July 10 meeting in the White House with Ukrainian officials differed from those provided by several others. According to other witnesses, John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, abruptly ended the meeting when Mr. Sondland raised the investigations.”

-- State Department officials were informed that Zelensky was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate Biden even before the July phone call, the AP reports: “In early May, officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were told Zelenskiy was seeking advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in ... He was concerned [Trump] and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race ... State Department officials in Kyiv and Washington were briefed on Zelenskiy’s concerns at least three times ... Notes summarizing his worries were circulated within the department ... The briefings and the notes show that U.S. officials knew early that Zelenskiy was feeling pressure to investigate Biden, even though the Ukrainian leader later denied it in a joint news conference with Trump in September.”

MORE ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Two senators are looking into a second whistleblower’s allegations that at least one political appointee at the Treasury Department tried to interfere with an audit of Trump or Vice President Pence. Jeff Stein and Tom Hamburger scoop: “Staff members for Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Wyden (Ore.), the chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, met with the IRS whistleblower earlier this month ... Follow-up interviews are expected to further explore the whistleblower’s allegations. It could not be learned to what extent the senators consider the whistleblower a credible source. Trump administration officials have previously played down the complaint’s significance and suggested that it is politically motivated. The whistleblower, a career IRS official, initially filed a complaint in July, reporting that he was told that at least one Treasury political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president’s or vice president’s tax returns.

""In recent weeks, the whistleblower filed additional documentation related to the original complaint, which was given to congressional officials in July ... The IRS whistleblower complaint was first disclosed in an August court filing by Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. … Neal made the disclosure in court filings as part of his battle with the Trump administration over the president’s tax returns, which the Treasury Department has refused to furnish. … The Treasury inspector general has opened a review of the Treasury Department’s handling of House Democrats’ request for Trump’s tax returns. Asked whether that review would look at the IRS whistleblower’s complaint, Rich Delmar, the acting inspector general, said in an email that ‘the inquiry is ongoing, and will take into account that aspects of the underlying matter are the subject of litigation.’""

-- The impeachment inquiry is expanding to explore whether Trump lied to former special counsel Bob Mueller, the House's general counsel told a federal appeals court. Ann E. Marimow, Spencer S. Hsu and Rachael Bade report: “The statement came during arguments over Congress’s demand for the urgent release of secret grand jury evidence from Mueller’s probe of Russia’s 2016 election interference, with House lawyers detailing fresh concerns about Trump’s truthfulness that could become part of the impeachment inquiry. The hearing followed Friday’s conviction of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone for lying to Congress. Testimony and evidence at his trial appeared to cast doubt on Trump’s written answers to Mueller’s questions … ‘Did the president lie? Was the president not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?’ General Counsel Douglas N. Letter said in court. ‘The House is now trying to determine whether the current president should remain in office,’ Letter added. ‘This is something that is unbelievably serious and it’s happening right now, very fast.’ … Behind the scenes, there’s been debate among Democratic lawmakers about whether articles of impeachment should include obstruction of justice allegations detailed in Mueller’s report.”

-- Mitch McConnell said he still “can’t imagine a scenario” that would lead to Trump’s conviction in the Senate. “I can’t imagine a scenario under which President Trump would be removed from office with 67 votes in the Senate,” the Senate majority leader said, according the Louisville Courier-Journal.

-- The Supreme Court placed a temporary hold on a lower court’s ruling that said accounting firm Mazars USA must turn over eight years of Trump’s financial records. Robert Barnes reports: “The House itself had acquiesced to such a move earlier Monday. Without the court’s intervention, the firm would have been required to turn over the records Wednesday. Trump last week asked the high court to stop the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. … House General Counsel Douglas N. Letter said in a letter to the court Monday morning that the committee will oppose Trump’s motion. But ‘out of courtesy to this court,’ Letter said the committee did not oppose putting the D.C. Circuit’s ruling on hold temporarily. Roberts said in his short order that the House’s opposition to Trump’s filing should be filed by Thursday.”

-- Another federal judge blocked the House from obtaining Trump’s New York state tax returns without a court review. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols of Washington entered the unusual order in a potentially precedent-setting case, which came even though the House committee has not said whether it wants the records and has sought to toss out Trump’s lawsuit, filed last July. Nichols’s 19-page decision and order came one week after the judge dismissed New York state officials from the lawsuit, which sought to bar the House from requesting and state officials from turning over Trump’s returns using New York’s Trust Act, signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) and enacted July 7. … New York tax officials had agreed not to turn over Trump’s records any sooner than seven days after Nichols ruled on whether the Trump lawsuit should be heard before him or before a federal judge in New York.”

-- Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham announced that he will hold a hearing on Dec. 11 featuring Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. From Politico: “Horowitz's scheduled appearance before the committee comes as the inspector general is wrapping up an investigation into the origins of the FBI probe into the 2016 Trump campaign's dealings with Russia. … In a statement announcing the hearing, Graham described Horowitz as ‘a good man that has served our national well.’ … The South Carolina Republican added that Horowitz ‘will deliver a detailed report of what he found regarding his investigation, along with recommendations as to how to make our judicial and investigative systems better.’”

-- Nepotism alert: What does Rudy Giuliani’s son Andrew actually do in the White House all day? The Atlantic's Elaina Plott tried to figure it out: “The younger Giuliani has served in the Office of Public Liaison, beginning as an associate director, since March 2017, making him one of the longest-serving members of the Trump administration. According to White House personnel records from 2018, he earns a salary of $90,700. The public-liaison office deals with outreach to outside coalitions, and several of the current and former administration officials I spoke to for this story said Giuliani helps arrange sports teams’ visits to the White House. ... But sports-team visits are more special-occasion than scheduling staple in the business of government, especially in this White House, where many title-winning teams decline invitations to visit or are simply not invited at all. … Steve Munisteri, who was principal director of the public-liaison office and Giuliani’s supervisor from February 2017 to February 2019, told me that Giuliani fills out his time by serving as the office’s representative at White House meetings about the opioid crisis.

""Others who have worked with Giuliani offered a different take on his White House tenure. ‘He doesn’t really try to be involved in anything,’ one former senior White House official told me ... ‘He’s just having a nice time.’ Yet for the differing opinions on the nature of Giuliani’s role, the officials I spoke to were certain that Giuliani had nabbed a White House post in the first place because of his father. A second former senior White House official plainly called it ‘a nepotism job.’”

-- Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson said it’s “wrong” to ask another country for personal favors. “If you’re seeking some kind of personal gain and you’re using — whether it’s American foreign aid or American weapons or American influence — that’s wrong. And I think everyone understands that,” he told PBS NewsHour. (Well, not everyone.)

-- Jimmy Finkelstein, the owner of the Hill newspaper, has stayed out of the impeachment headlines, despite playing a crucial role in the saga. From CNN: “Finkelstein was [John] Solomon's direct supervisor at The Hill and created the conditions which permitted Solomon to publish his conspiratorial stories without the traditional oversight implemented at news outlets. And he has kept a watchful eye on the newspaper's coverage to ensure it is not too critical of the President. As one former veteran employee of The Hill told CNN Business, ‘Solomon is a symptom of the larger problem of Jimmy Finkelstein.’ … The paper's editor-in-chief sent staff a note Monday morning notifying employees that editors ‘are reviewing, updating, annotating with any denials of witnesses, and when appropriate, correcting any [of Solomon's] pieces referenced during the ongoing congressional inquiry.’ … Finkelstein has been friends with Trump for decades. In fact, according to a former employee at The Hill, he ‘boasts that he's a close friend’ of the President.""

-- Rep. Devin Nunes’s attorney is representing one of the congressman’s former aides in a new defamation lawsuit against Politico. McClatchy reports: “Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel, a lawyer who worked for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee when Nunes was the committee’s chairman, is suing Politico over an Oct. 23 story with the headline ‘Nunes Protege Fed Ukraine Info to Trump.’ … Patel is represented by Virginia attorney Steven Biss, who has filed five lawsuits on behalf of Nunes this year alleging that news organizations, Twitter, anonymous social media users and political consultants conspired against the California congressman. … The news story at the center of Patel’s lawsuit reported that Patel tried to involve himself in the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy. Patel now works [on] the National Security Council. The story by Politico reporter Natasha Bertrand was based on sources who described diplomats’ testimony at closed-door House Intelligence Committee hearings…”

Politico spokesman Brad Dayspring calls the suit baseless: “This lawsuit is high on bombast and low on merit. It is unserious and is a public relations tactic designed to intimidate journalists and media organizations from doing their job,” he said in a statement.

-- Tribalism alert: A remarkable 2 in 3 Americans say that nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR-PBS-Marist poll. “It's a tangible example of just how locked in most Americans are in their partisan positions, even as nearly a dozen people have either testified or are set to testify in the impeachment inquiry. The poll was conducted Nov. 11-15 — before, during and after the testimonies of the first three witnesses to be called in the inquiry. … By a 47%-41% margin, Americans say they are more likely to support impeachment based on what they've heard or read from the testimonies and evidence presented. And the testimonies could actually be serving to harden their views — 86% of Democrats said they are now more likely to support impeachment after hearing testimony and evidence while 83% of Republicans said they are less likely to now support impeachment. … Some 70% of registered voters say they've been paying ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ close attention to the House impeachment inquiry. And 53% of those paying at least fairly close attention say they're more likely to support impeachment.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Mike Pompeo declared that Israel’s West Bank settlements do not violate international law. Karen DeYoung, Steve Hendrix and John Hudson report: ""The move upends more than 40 years of U.S. policy that has declared Israeli expansion into territories occupied since the 1967 war a major obstacle to settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In response to a question, Pompeo denied that the announcement was connected to turmoil in Israel in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has supported the Israeli annexation of West Bank territory, is fighting for his political life. … Pompeo said the administration was returning to policy under Ronald Reagan, pointing out that Reagan said in a 1981 interview that settlements were ‘not illegal.’ Reagan went on in that interview, however, to say that settlements were ‘ill-advised.’” Pompeo said the Trump administration, as it did with recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and Israel’s sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights, has simply ""recognized the reality on the ground.""

-- A bid by Netanyahu’s rival to form a new Israeli government has entered its final, fraught stretch. Ruth Eglash reports: Benny Gantz's options are limited. ""The most obvious choice — uniting with [Netanyahu’s] ruling Likud party — appears increasingly unlikely, while forming a government dependent on smaller parties with sharply conflicting ideologies seems an almost impossible gamble. Gantz has until midnight Wednesday to announce a government, then secure enough support in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, to approve the new configuration. If not, Israel will enter politically uncharted territory, with even the keenest of political observers saying they have no idea what might happen next — though most are betting it will set Israel on the path to a third national election in less than a year.”

-- An American and an Australian who were being held hostage for the past three years were released by the Taliban. That announcement came shortly after it was revealed that three detained Taliban commanders had been flown to Qatar. Sayed Salahuddin and Sharif Hassan report: ""American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks were instructors at the American University of Kabul when they were kidnapped in 2016. The militants are Mali Khan, Hafiz Rashid and Anas Haqqani, a younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy leader and son of the Haqqani network’s founder. They were held in a government detention center at Bagram air base. The Haqqani network is an insurgent group closely allied with the Taliban. It is accused of orchestrating many of the sophisticated and deadly attacks against Afghan and foreign installations in recent years.”

-- Swedish prosecutors announced that the alleged rape investigation involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been dropped. Karla Adam reports: “Eva-Marie Persson, the deputy director of public prosecution, said in a statement that ‘my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.’ In 2010, Assange was accused of committing sexual offences in Sweden. A case involving an alleged rape was abandoned in 2017, but then reopened earlier this year after Assange was evicted from the Ecuador Embassy in London. Assange is currently serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for jumping bail in 2012 and is fighting extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents.”

-- As violence spikes, some Hong Kong activists see salvation in their British citizenship. Rick Noack reports: “As the Hong Kong leadership — backed by Beijing — is increasingly cracking down on pro-democracy protests in the semiautonomous territory, some argue that the West’s most credible leverage over the Chinese leadership there hinges on the British National Overseas (BNO) passport category. Issued to those who were residents of Hong Kong before the transfer of power in 1997, the passports entitle holders to some but not all rights that British citizens can rely on. Passport holders can, for instance, travel to Britain for up to six months without a visa or seek consular assistance abroad, but they are not entitled to stay in the U.K. indefinitely. Calls on the U.K. government to grant BNO passport holders full British citizenship are gradually mounting, however, amid concerns that China may be breaking its promise to maintain Hong Kong’s semiautonomous status for at least three more decades.”

-- China slammed Hong Kong judges after they ruled that demonstrators could wear face masks. Gerry Shih, Tiffany Liang and David Crawshaw report: “The central government’s Hong Kong affairs office said that Monday’s judgment ‘blatantly challenged the authority’ of China’s legislature and of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and created ‘severe negative social and political impact.’ … The comments poured fuel on one of the central grievances of Hong Kong’s protest movement — encroachment by the mainland government on the semiautonomous territory’s affairs — and could exacerbate clashes after days of violent standoffs on university campuses. But they reflect the Chinese government’s diminishing patience for the unrest, as evidenced by an increasingly harsh line from officials and state media, some of which have urged police to use live ammunition against protesters.”

-- About 100 protestors remain holed up at a university surrounded by police in Hong Kong. From the Guardian: “Lam ... said about 600 protesters surrendered to authorities at the Polytechnic University campus in Kowloon overnight, after police allowed two representatives to mediate between the two sides. About 20 activists were evacuated to seek medical help. In her first public remarks since the crisis began more than 36 hours ago, Lam said that 200 of those who surrendered were children and were not arrested. She said however that authorities reserved the right to make further investigations in the future. Lam said the other 400 who left the campus have been arrested. … Groups of protesters have tried to escape the tight police cordon around the campus. Late on Monday, dozens were seen abseiling down a footbridge as police fired tear gas, to drivers on motorbikes who whisked them away. Others tried to flee through manhole covers. … Police said they had allowed Red Cross volunteers into the university to ferry out injured protesters but said the rest had no option but to give themselves up.”

-- American federal agencies have failed to adequately respond to the threat of Chinese government-funded programs that have recruited scientists and exploited U.S. research to strengthen China’s own economy and military. From the Wall Street Journal: “With what are known as ‘talent programs,’ the Chinese government provides compensation and resources to researchers who at times illicitly transfer intellectual property to China, in some cases setting up shadow labs overseas mirroring their U.S. research, according to the report released Monday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Participants are routinely told to conceal their participation from U.S. authorities, the report said. … The Chinese government has concentrated recruitment efforts on those born in China but working in the U.S., although it also has recruited some people who are not ethnic Chinese. The report included examples of U.S.-funded scientists who allegedly willfully failed to disclose their participation in China’s Thousand Talents Plan, the best-known of more than 200 similar Chinese programs, or engaged in other activities counter to U.S. research values, the report said.”

-- North Korean veteran diplomat and Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan said the country is no longer interested in holding talks with the U.S., saying it does not want to “gift the U.S. president with something he can brag about.” Anne Gearan reports: “Trump has been hoping for a third summit with North Korea, ideally within about three months, to show that his bold effort to befriend and persuade Kim is working. … Talks have been bogged down for months, with North Korea demanding relief from economic sanctions before any meaningful discussion of disarmament. The Trump administration has stuck to its dual approach, retaining sanctions while offering free-flowing, direct leader-to-leader talks that traditional diplomacy would reserve for the very end of a process. Kim Kye Gwan’s statement to the Korean-language website of the official Korean Central News Agency [said] … that despite the two leaders’ previous meetings, ‘there has not been much improvement in relations with the United States.’”

-- The U.S. broke off talks with South Korea over how to share the cost of the two nations’ military alliance. Min Joo Kim reports: “Trump has demanded South Korea raise fivefold its contribution to cover the cost of stationing 28,500 U.S. troops in the country, asking for nearly $5 billion, officials on both sides said. But that demand has triggered anger from Korean lawmakers and sparked concerns that Trump may decide to reduce the U.S. troop presence in the Korean Peninsula if talks break down. The top U.S. negotiator, James DeHart, said the U.S. side decided to cut short the negotiations on Tuesday morning, the second of two days of planned talks. In a rare public show of disunity between the allies, he blamed South Korea for making proposals that ‘were not responsive to our request for fair and equitable burden sharing.’ … Trump insists that South Korea, as a ‘very wealthy nation,’ needs to pay more. His demand for up to $5 billion would imply South Korea was effectively not only being asked to cover local costs but also the entire wage bill for the U.S. troops.”

-- Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswomen who claims she once had a “very special relationship” with Boris Johnson, said the U.K. prime minister has fed her “to the wolves” while ghosting her. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “British authorities are looking into accusations that she received undue advantages because of her association with Johnson, including grants and contracts and participation in three trade missions abroad as part of Johnson’s entourage. … Whether there are grounds for a criminal investigation won’t be announced until after Britain’s Dec. 12 election. And whether Arcuri’s accusations of bad behavior can hurt Johnson and his Conservative Party at the polls is unclear. … Johnson, 55, is separated from his wife and living with his partner, Carrie Symonds, 31, at the prime minister’s official residence at 10 Downing Street. This arrangement, a first in British history, is barely commented on in the news media. … He remains Britain’s most popular politician.”

-- As she named herself Bolivia’s interim leader, Jeanine Áñez said her “only objective” would be to call for new elections. Yet in the week since she assumed power, the conservative leader has acted like anything but a caretaker as she undoes 14 years of socialist rule under former president Evo Morales. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “In just seven days, the U.S.-backed leader has replaced Bolivia’s top military brass, cabinet ministers and the heads of major state-owned companies with appointees of her own. Her administration has threatened to arrest ‘seditious’ lawmakers, and ejected allies of the old government including Venezuelan diplomats and Cuban doctors. Her new foreign minister announced Bolivia’s exit from the Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, a union of socialist nations based in Caracas. As supporters of Morales took to the streets last week to object, Áñez issued a presidential decree granting security forces immunity from prosecution for ‘participating in operations to reestablish internal order.’ Within hours, a confrontation between soldiers and Morales supporters near Cochabamba left nine dead.”

-- Libya’s U.N.-backed government believes that two Russians arrested on spying allegations earlier this year were employed by the Kremlin-friendly Wagner Group, a security firm. Missy Ryan and Sudarsan Raghavan report: “Fathi Bashagha, who serves as interior minister for the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), said the Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of attempting to influence planned municipal elections and gather information on the GNA’s military operations against a rival force, which is based in eastern Libya and backed by Russia. Speaking in an interview during a visit to Washington, Bashagha said the men had provided ‘confessions’ and remained in detention while the GNA attorney general investigates their activities. The alleged intelligence operation coincides with mounting concern about Russian involvement in a battle for control of Tripoli and the larger schism in the country that has impaired the oil industry and provided a foothold to Islamist militant groups.”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Trump’s health is under scrutiny again after an unplanned visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. Toluse Olorunnipa and Amy Gardner report: “In a memo released by the White House late Monday, Trump’s doctor, Sean Conley, wrote that Trump’s ‘interim checkup’ over the weekend had been ‘routine,’ and was only kept secret because of ‘scheduling uncertainties.’ ‘Despite some speculation, the President has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues,’ Conley wrote in the memo. ‘Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations.’ While Trump claimed that he had begun ‘phase one’ of his annual physical, Conley said Trump would have a ‘more comprehensive examination’ next year. Trump described his condition on Twitter as ‘very good (great!)’; Conley’s memo did not characterize the president’s overall health. It did include cholesterol figures that had dropped since Trump’s last physical exam in February. It is unusual for a president to undergo a physical exam in multiple stages months apart, and the circumstances surrounding Trump’s visit renewed questions about the White House’s handling of his medical information, according to several experts. … Two people who interacted with Trump late last week said that he seemed to be hoarse and have signs of a cold but that nothing serious seemed amiss.”

“Trump’s mysterious hospital visit raises many questions. His explanation for it didn’t answer any of them,” writes the Post’s Editorial Board.

-- Prosecutors are preparing to file charges against two Bureau of Prisons workers who were supposed to regularly check on millionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein the night he hanged himself in his cell. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: “The two corrections workers, whose names have not been released, fell under suspicion immediately after Epstein was found early on the morning of Aug. 10 in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail used primarily for people awaiting trial. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging, although lawyers for the disgraced financier have questioned that conclusion. … The death of the most high-profile defendant in the federal prison system led to a major shake-up at the Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William P. Barr brought in a former director of the agency to run it again, and replaced the top official at the MCC, saying the preliminary investigation had found ‘serious irregularities at the center.’

""Those irregularities include logs indicating that Epstein was checked on regularly, in accordance with MCC procedures. Investigators don’t believe those checks happened … Prosecutors have been focused on charges against the officers of falsifying federal records ... In recent weeks, they sought to have the officers plead guilty, though they refused.”

-- Emails obtained by CBS News show that San Diego billionaire Doug Manchester was pressed by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to donate half a million bucks to the party while his Senate confirmation to become the ambassador to the Bahamas hung in the balance. “Manchester donated $1 million to Mr. Trump's inauguration fund. He was offered the Bahamas post the day after Mr. Trump was sworn in. Manchester said Mr. Trump told him, ‘I should probably be the ambassador to the Bahamas and you should be president.’ Then, for two and a half years, Manchester's nomination stalled in the Senate. … He wrote back to McDaniel's request for $500,000, ‘As you know I am not supposed to do any, but my wife is sending a contribution for $100,000. Assuming I get voted out of the [Foreign Relations Committee] on Wednesday to the floor we need you to have the majority leader bring it to a majority vote … Once confirmed, I our [sic] family will respond!’”

-- The Trump State Department appointee who inflated her résumé has resigned amid fresh questions about the Trump team's clearly flawed vetting process. Reis Thebault reports: In a letter of resignation to Pompeo, Mina Chang “defended herself and criticized the ‘toxic environment’ at the agency, where she had served as a deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations since April. Chang denied creating or commissioning the Time cover and wrote that her resignation should be seen ‘as a protest and not as surrender,’ closing by saying that stepping down was ‘the only acceptable moral and ethical option for me at this time.’ … ‘The Department of State is experiencing what I and many believe is the worst and most profound moral crisis confronting career professionals and political appointees in the Department’s history,’ wrote Chang, who had no diplomatic experience before joining the State Department. …Chang, in her rebuttal document, argued that her ‘background was fully investigated by the FBI and State Department’s Diplomatic Security. No questions were raised or concerns identified during the process.’”

-- In Georgia, Democrats are finding out that turning the state blue is easier to predict than to pull off. Jenna Johnson reports: “Four Gwinnett County Democratic Party leaders gathered on living-room couches to … [address a pressing] priority: In less than a month, Republican state leaders plan to purge the registrations of 330,000 voters who haven’t participated in recent elections — roughly 22,000 of whom are registered in Gwinnett County, many of them likely Democrats. They spent hours debating how best to find these voters and keep them registered, and organizing phone banks, including one ahead of a Democratic debate watch party Wednesday night. Then came a text message from another county party member who had heard that the state party was organizing a similar effort, as was a nonprofit group. ‘We don’t have time for this,’ Bianca Keaton, the first black woman to lead the Gwinnett County Democrats, said with exasperation. ‘We are moving ahead with the plan we made this morning. I don’t want them in Gwinnett County.’ The exchange was yet another reminder that while Democrats see themselves as poised to take over the state, they are a long way from building the kind of coordinated effort that Georgia Republicans — and Democrats in places like Virginia and elsewhere — have long enjoyed.”

-- In Virginia, Democratic lawmakers rushed to file bills as the legislative window opened for next year’s General Assembly session, setting out voting rights, gun control, LGBTQ protections and the Equal Rights Amendment as priorities for their newfound majority. Gregory S. Schneider reports: “It was bad timing for Republican leaders, who traveled to Richmond Monday to officially shut down the special legislative session on gun control that they had cut short over the summer. As the state’s docket began filling with Democratic proposals, Republican leaders presided over the floor of the Senate and House of Delegates for probably the last time before their rivals take over. … House Democrats chose [Democratic Del. Eileen] Filler-Corn as their speaker-designee, putting her in line to be the chamber’s first female leader in its 400-year history. Republicans made no effort Monday to draw attention to proposed legislation, which can be filed until 10 days after the session starts Jan. 8.”

-- Three people were killed during a shooting in a Walmart parking lot in Duncan, Okla. Katie Mettler reports: “The shooting took place just before 10 a.m., reported the Duncan Banner. Officers with the Duncan Police Department responded to the Walmart Supercenter on Highway 81 in Duncan, a city 65 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. A man and woman were found dead inside a car in the parking lot, and another man was found dead outside the car, police said in the statement. It was not immediately clear whether the alleged shooter was among those who died. A handgun was found at the scene, authorities said. The Duncan Banner reported that Red River Technology Center and Duncan Public Schools were put on lockdown.”

-- The shooting at a Fresno, Calif., backyard gathering that left four dead was a targeted attack, police said. Derek Hawkins, Katie Shpeherd and Katie Mettler report: “The shooting stunned Southeast Asian Hmong residents in Fresno, which is home to the largest Hmong population in California and the second-largest Hmong population in the United States. … The attackers, armed with semiautomatic pistols, fled on foot before partygoers could make out their faces in the darkness, police said. … Fresno Police Deputy Chief Andrew Hall said the department was mobilizing an ‘Asian gang task force’ to investigate whether the attack was connected to recent a spike in violent crime in the city by Asian gangs. There was no indication that the residents were involved in gangs, he said, but investigators believe the gunman intentionally targeted the house.”

-- About 60 percent of Superfund sites overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency could be hit by climate change, a new Government Accountability Office report found. Dino Grandoni and Brady Dennis report: “GAO investigators said the agency needs to take more aggressive action to acknowledge risks facing some of the nation’s most polluted sites — and to safeguard them amid a changing climate. Even as they agreed with the GAO on certain points, Trump administration officials formally rejected a recommendation to clarify how preparing toxic sites to withstand the impacts of climate change is part of the EPA’s mission.”

-- WeWork could lay off thousands of employees as the company tries to recover from a disastrous attempt to go public. Marie C. Baca reports: “That means WeWork could lose about a third of the 12,500-person head count it had in June, according to a company filing. WeWork Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure told employees that layoffs would begin this week."" There are also reports that the New York attorney general is investigating the former chief executive for alleged self-dealing.

If you are a 37-year-old pol with a mixed record as mayor of the 305th-largest city in America running for president against six sitting United States senators and a front-runner who entered the Senate a decade before you were born, you will need to make a virtue of being a young outsider. Pete Buttigieg is going beyond making the defensive case that he’s not too young or inexperienced for the job; he’s turning it into a positive electability argument. Here’s how he put it to GQ’s Jason Zengerle:

“Every time Democrats have succeeded in the last 50 years, it’s been with a new-generation figure who’s not been marinating in Washington for a long time,” he told me. “Every time we’ve tried to go with the kind of safe, established, been-here-for-a-long-time kind of figure, we have come up short. This isn’t just a pattern. This is an iron, unbroken law going back to the ‘60s.”

Now there’s some chutzpah, folks. No wonder Zengerle’s piece is titled “The Audacity of Pete Buttigieg.”

But how about his historical claim? To begin with, the ranks of Democratic presidential winners in the last 50 years is a classic small sample: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. If you go back another 50 years, there are four Democratic presidents, three of them U.S. senators (LBJ, JFK, and Truman), and the fourth, FDR, a veteran of national politics who had been assistant secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson. Buttigieg does not offer any particular reason to make 1969 the crucial year when being a Washingtonian stopped being an asset and started violating an “iron, unbroken law.”

The three predecessors he does claim had things going for them beyond being young, inexperienced, and from outside Washington.

Carter ran for president at the precise moment in history where it again became possible and advantageous for a white, Deep South Democrat to take the plunge. He became nationally popular by slaying the dragon of George Wallace’s terrifying candidacy, and then narrowly won the presidency mostly because he was uniquely able to lash together a coalition of liberals and conservatives that included former civil-rights workers and career racists (including Wallace) to sweep the South and southern-inflected areas. He was 51, not all that young, and had served in statewide office.

Obama, of course, was a U.S. senator (albeit a freshman), but being relatively young and inexperienced was not the most prominent thing about his candidacy: Like Carter, he had an identity advantage that turned out to be crucial.

And yes, Clinton was a governor, but by the time he ran for president he was quite well-known in national political circles. In 1990, I wrote a speech for my then-boss Sam Nunn introducing Clinton as “the first politician to become a bright, rising star in three different decades.” It got a big laugh because it was true.

The context in which these “outsiders” got into the White House mattered, too. Carter and Clinton ran against incumbent presidents who were struggling through tough economic times; Carter had the additional edge of running after Watergate had tainted Washington and the GOP. Obama’s opponent, John McCain, another longtime Washington veteran, was famously about as different from Donald J. Trump as another white Republican could possibly be.

None of this is to deny there is a kernel of truth in what Buttigieg said. All other things being equal, getting one’s experience in politics and government outside Washington can be a positive, particularly for those in what is often perceived as the “party of Big Government.” Carter, Clinton, and Obama definitely took advantage of their backgrounds and the Washington pedigrees of their rivals. And Buttigieg has some other things in common with past winner: his own claim to a “historic” identity as the first viable openly gay presidential contender, a connection with a crucial midwestern battleground region, and his obvious charm and intelligence.

Still, Mayor Pete should be careful with this “iron, unbroken law” language. If he loses the nomination battle to one of his senatorial (or vice-presidential) rivals and is out there campaigning for the winner, as he surely will, it’s the sort of, well, audacious remark that could come back to haunt him."

Though it may be difficult to focus on anything other than Gordon Sondland’s explosive impeachment testimony, there’s a Democratic debate happening on Wednesday night in Atlanta. With Pete Buttigieg surging in Iowa, the one thing most observers expect is for the South Bend mayor to come in for some criticism from his fellow candidates. I chatted with national political correspondent Gabriel Debenedetti about what to expect.

Ben: After all the winnowing that was supposed to happen this fall, we’ve still got ten candidates onstage Wednesday night in Atlanta. But right now, the race features a clear top four: Biden, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg. The South Bend mayor has everyone on notice with his solid lead in Iowa in a recent poll, which came on the heels of his aggressive jab at Elizabeth Warren in the last debate over her health-care plan. This means that Mayor Pete, who has high favorability numbers and not a ton of criticism from his rivals thus far, is ripe for attack. Do you expect that he’ll be the central focus of incoming fire from other candidates?

Gabriel: Well, first, let’s note that his big number came in a poll of Iowa, which is super-important, but not the whole ball game. I still wouldn’t call him the national front-runner. But, that said… Yeah, it’s only logical, but it’s also been the pattern so far. Biden got the brunt of the fire in the first debate, Warren in the last one, and so on. Buttigieg’s team seems to be getting ready for this. To me, one of the big questions is whether Warren goes after him. She hasn’t yet done anything like that in any of the preceding debates, but obviously Buttigieg’s rise has appeared to eclipse her own in Iowa.

Ben: And when she released her new health-care plan last week, which puts Medicare for All on the back burner, he came out with a statement accusing her of wanting to kick 100-something million people off their health insurance. So I could see some version of “Are you a Republican or a Democrat?”

Gabriel: Warren, and some others, have repeatedly used the “let’s not use Republican talking points” line, but she got a good deal of blowback for suggesting Biden was running in the wrong primary when discussing health care a few weeks ago, so we’ll see which direction she goes. I’ll be really curious to see how central health care is in this debate. It’s dominated every one until now, basically, and it’s clearly been extremely important to the national conversation even outside of the debates. But now that the race feels like it’s in a new stage and we’ve got juuust a little impeachment news flooding the ecosystem, that calculus may change for the moderators.

Ben: I was sort of hoping that we wouldn’t begin with yet another 30-minute health-care section in which the moderator repeatedly asks Elizabeth Warren whether her plan will raise taxes on the middle class. (Though she does have a clearer answer for that now, thanks to her new proposal.) But yeah, it’s not getting any less important as a central issue in Democratic primary voters’ minds.

Gabriel: Absolutely not, it’s clearly top of mind, and it should still be treated as such. And Warren is almost definitely going to have to talk about her plan now that she’s released details. So how do you think she and Buttigieg will face off on this topic?

And will we get more policy chatter that all blends together over an hour, and allows Sanders to come out of it all looking calm while everyone else has had to defend themselves repeatedly?

Ben: I think it might be awkward for Buttigieg, because Warren has now basically proposed the same thing he has — Medicare for those who want it — just a more generous version. And he can say that she’s flip-flopped on the issue, but (a) I don’t know how much voters will care as long as she’s not still attaching herself to Medicare for All, and (b) he can credibly be accused of having done the same, since he made what appeared to be a very conscious swing to the center on this issue in recent weeks.

Gabriel: So the answer to my second question is “yeah.”

Ben: Haha. I think it’s possible. Sanders has somehow faded into the background while at the same time boosting his poll numbers, post–heart attack. This seems to be a good spot for him.

Gabriel: Yes, though in the last debate no one went after him because he was (a) immediately post–heart attack, and (b) thought to be fading. Neither of those is still the case. So he may find himself on defense, though. Again, I’m hoping this debate touches on things other than health care. On that front, I wouldn’t be surprised if Buttigieg is asked to speak about his corporate work for McKinsey, which he rarely talks about and has to answer for.

Ben: Yeah, that’s a bit of a black hole for him.

Gabriel: Like with so many other things, it’s possible he has a good answer for these questions now, we just have no idea because his time in the harsh spotlight hasn’t yet come.

Ben: It seems Joe Biden, like Bernie, has had a pretty smooth stretch — no big errors (unless you count his stance on weed), no alarming slips of the tongue — and he still holds healthy leads in most state polls, and continues to dominate among black voters. Might there be a renewed attempt to go after him aggressively, the way Kamala Harris did, or is there still this notion that he’ll just fade away at some point — which looks less and less likely?

Gabriel: I would never rule out the possibility that someone might go after Biden harshly, but it hasn’t worked for anyone who’s tried it. Not just Harris, but Booker and Castro and Swalwell and … I do think that the candidates outside of the top four will feel immense pressure to have big, memorable performances, but the truth is none of us knows what exactly that would have to look like to actually change their lot in the race.

Ben: Oh right, the other six candidates. It seems Klobuchar is having a bit of a surge in Iowa — she’ll probably keep making the “I can win in a purple state” case, right?

Gabriel: I don’t see why she wouldn’t, that’s her whole pitch. Klobuchar is doing better in Iowa, and she basically came into the last debate with the same plan as Buttigieg — to go after Warren on health care. So perhaps she’ll try that again, since everyone expects Buttigieg to get most of the pressure this time, giving her more time and space. But Booker and Steyer and Yang and Gabbard have yet to qualify for the December debate, and so they most desperately need something to happen.

Ben: Though, as I understand it, the latter three are very likely to, needing just one more poll or a gettable number of donors. Whereas Booker may be looking at the end of the line.

Gabriel: I don’t know about “very likely,” but yes, they certainly are confident they’ll be there. Booker, less so. Not that that’s the end of the line for him, of course. There are still sevenish candidates running who haven’t sniffed the debate stage in months (or at all)!

Ben: Riiight.

Gabriel: Anyway …! The feeling around this debate is pretty strange, I have to say, since so much of the attention is elsewhere, and since everyone I’ve talked to in campaign world agrees that the first thing they’re watching for is how Pete takes a hit. (It’s rare to have such agreement about What Matters and The Narrative.)

Ben: Ah yes, the whole impeachment thing. I’ve seen criticisms of past debates that take issue with how little Trump — you know, the existential threat to the country — is mentioned. But do the candidates have any disagreements about what’s going down in Washington right now? I’m not sure what there is to say.

Gabriel: They have philosophical disagreements about how central it is to the country’s ills, absolutely. And since one read of presidential primaries is that they’re audition processes for the general election, it might be useful to hear the candidates all talk about the most important thing happening, which will almost certainly be central to the general election no matter what. (Trump’s various misdeeds, that is, if not the Ukraine scandal specifically.) There’s a reason it’s been (momentarily, at least) effective whenever candidates say onstage, “Hang on, why are we talking about this? Trump is president!!” in the middle of some policy discussion where the disagreement is marginal.

Ben: Yeah. And gives them a chance to look reasonable and collegial, too.

Gabriel: Which, y’know, they basically are.

Ben: Says YOU.

Gabriel: I yield my time to the chairman."

Yes, despite the Trump impeachment hearings, the Democratic presidential candidate debates continue. And when qualifying for the November 20 stage in Atlanta ended at midnight last Wednesday, ten candidates made the cut: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. The podium arrangement hasn’t been announced yet, but it’s likely going to be Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren at center stage.

The October debaters missing in Atlanta will be the two Texans: Beto O’Rourke, who dropped out of the race two weeks ago, and Julián Castro, who met the donor threshold for inclusion but did not have a single qualifying national or early state poll. Castro has said that “it will be the end of my campaign” if he failed to qualify, so there is a death watch on his candidacy. So we are back to the ten-candidate stage that we had in June and July.

As the debaters prepare for Atlanta, qualifying for the December 19 debate in Los Angeles is well underway (the cutoff date is December 12), with higher donor (200,000) and polling (four early state or national polls at 4 percent or more, or two early state polls at 6 percent or more) thresholds. Just six candidates have made that cut: Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Klobuchar, Sanders, and Warren. Of the other November debaters, only Yang has met the donor threshold so far (though that’s never been much of an obstacle to aspiring debaters in the past); he’s two debates shy of qualifying. Steyer has his four polls, and just needs to get his donors squared away. Gabbard has one 6 percent–plus early state poll and three 4 percent–plus polls; she needs just one more qualifying poll and then the requisite donors to make the stage.

Cory Booker is in the most trouble right now: He has zero qualifying polls and hasn’t met the donor threshold either. He really needs to cook in Atlanta to lift his standing, but then again, the New Jersey senator has been among the most effective debaters all along, without getting much of a lift. He clearly needs a break, and perhaps a real stumble from someone above him on the slippery pole that ascends up to the nomination."

Joe Biden leads most polls; Elizabeth Warren has sometimes been considered the real frontrunner; Pete Buttigieg is surging in Iowa. Where does that leave Bernie Sanders? I spoke with politics editor Ezekiel Kweku and senior writer Eric Levitz about whether the Vermont senator has been underestimated in recent weeks, and what his path to the nomination might look like.

Ben: Just a few weeks ago, Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack and told a reporter he’d be cutting back on his vigorous campaign schedule — a remark he quickly took back. Since then, he has shown no sign of physical problems, had probably his strongest debate yet, and done quite well in early-state polls, consistently bunched up near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire. In the lefty lane, Elizabeth Warren has gotten a lot of the attention lately, what with the billionaires arrayed against her. Are (some) people now underrating Bernie’s chances to actually win this thing?

Ezekiel: My feeling is that his relative strength with black and Latino voters compared to Warren makes him a tier-one candidate, which is what I’ve always believed, and putting him below that is underrating him.

Ben: Indeed, there have been multiple pieces recently about his solid Latino support. And in a South Carolina poll released this week, he was second only to Biden among black voters (granted, there was a 34 point drop-off).

Eric: Some surely are underrating him. I think Warren has lost steam due to her front-runner status triggering more skeptical media coverage (her related decision to dig into Medicare for All financing may have also played some role). That, plus Sanders’s surprisingly robust (ostensible) health, plus the firmness of his core support, plus strength of his fundraising, plus new centrist candidates coming out of the woodwork to split the vote have all made his odds look a bit better in recent weeks. The more crowded the field in Iowa, the more plausible it is that Bernie rides the devotion of his core base to a narrow plurality win, which could then boost him to victory in New Hampshire, which would probably force Warren out of the race. So you can construct a path.

Ben: The usual knock on Bernie in terms of his viability is that he has his diehards, but has had trouble expanding beyond that group. Would he necessarily be the first place Warren voters looked if their candidate went down? Numbers show that the Warren and Buttigieg fan base, for example, may have more in common, demographic-wise, than the Warren and Bernie fan bases.

Eric: I think it would partly depend on whether she endorses, and whether her supporters in the progressive media/think tank world see Bernie as viable enough to rally behind. A lot depends on what the rest of the field looks like. If Bernie wins Iowa and New Hampshire, I’m not sure that Pete makes it too far. Could become a Bernie-Biden race fairly quickly.

Ezekiel: I agree that it will depend on who she endorses. I also feel like we tend to overestimate how ideological even primaries are. I haven’t checked since the Buttigieg boom, but polls of “second choices” tended not to conform with ideology. So I think you’re onto something when you say that Warren’s voters may not necessarily flow to Sanders. I think the fact that voters are so focused on electability makes the race more fluid than it would ordinarily be. If a candidate stumbles in a way that makes them seem less plausible in a general election, it could kill their candidacy pretty quickly. I think that’s what happened with Harris, for instance.

Ben: Sanders enjoys tweaking the press for downplaying his odds, and him in general. I often find those criticisms to be overdone. But it is true that Warren has many supporters in the world of opinion-shaping media — to what extent does that play a role in their diverging (and now more converging) paths?

Eric: I think one reason for Warren’s high support (relative to Sanders) among opinion-shaping media is that she is better exemplar of (progressive) professional-class virtue. She comes to politics through policy wonkery, and seems to have really done her homework on all the major issues. Whereas Sanders is a former overeducated, underemployed left-wing activist who is less detail-oriented in his policy advocacy. A second reason is that she is a bit less hostile to the Democratic Party as an institution. I think those two qualities also give her a distinct (and potentially larger) coalition among Democratic primary voters than Bernie’s. I think she derives some independent benefit from her support among opinion journalists. But I think her main media advantage had been that even MSM reportage on her was kind of soft, in part because the Fourth Estate wants a competitive race and admires her emphasis on policy.

Once she became the front-runner though, mainstream coverage turned a bit, and that’s helped Bernie gain ground. I do think if Sanders starts outpolling Warren consistently, you’ll see coverage of him become much more prominent and intensely negative, which might knock him right back down, especially if his rivals successfully stoke the electability fears Ezekiel referenced.

Ezekiel: I confess that I have found the Warren/Bernie debates to be tiresome in an unproductive manner for awhile — but I think Warren is more popular than Bernie with the media because of the way she has consistently framed her positions in terms of old-school American liberalism (which the media likes) instead of “democratic socialism,” which the media does not like. The reasons that the media doesn’t like that framing is part of why Bernie chose it in the first place, so I don’t really understand the complaints that the media doesn’t like Bernie. I think the wonkery is a little less causal. You can easily imagine Warren getting the “egghead professor with ivory tower plans” label if she had framed her candidacy in a way similar to Sanders.

Eric: True. She does still get a little of that, to be fair.

Ben: The biggest vein of negative coverage for Warren has concerned her attachment to Medicare for All, the policy Bernie really popularized. Warren backed off her all-or-nothing approach last week in an effort to appease possibly uncomfortable voters, but it’s hard to imagine Bernie doing something similar. If he gets closer to the nomination, will he encounter the same level of skepticism she did? Or does he sort of get extra credit for having been touting his exact vision of the world for many years? Can he use his authenticity, in other words, as a kind of shield?

Eric: Well, Warren ended up facing more skepticism than Sanders on M4A financing (even though he has not released any detailed plan for how he’d pay for his version of the program) for two reasons: (1) At the last debate, everyone had an incentive to take a swing at the new front-runner, and no one considered the 78-year-old socialist who’d just come back from a heart attack to be a serious threat. (2) Bernie copped to the need to raise middle-class taxes to some degree, while Warren didn’t.

I think if Bernie moved solidly into second place, Biden & Co. would stop saying “at least Bernie has leveled with the American people on this” and start pointing out that the list of pay-fors he released does not add up to the estimated cost of his program.

Ezekiel: I feel like her phase-in approach (like her head tax) is an attempt to avoid getting criticism from the media, and I think it might work. The problem with it is that the more complicated your approach, the harder it is to rebut attacks on it effectively. I don’t think her new approach is going to blunt attacks from other candidates in the primary, and I don’t think it will be easier to defend in a general election. I could be wrong.

Eric: I think Warren subsequently decided that Bernie has a lock on single-issue single-payer voters, and so there’s a bit less upside for her to remain 100 percent ideologically maximalist on the issue than for him. Mostly though, I think her campaign was probably freaked out by Pete’s sudden surge in Iowa. I have no idea how her pivot will play out politically.

Ben: Do you have any thoughts about Bernie’s “electability” versus the other front-runners right now? He has a good case that he’d activate voters disgusted by both parties in a way that no other candidate would?

Eric: I think there are decent electability arguments for and against all the major candidates. I think Bernie’s is stronger than mainstream punditry (which, in my view, tends to mechanically equate policy moderation with electability) suggests. The fact that he has served as an Independent for decades gives him some appeal to anti-Establishment indie voters of various ideological stripes. Or so Nate Cohn’s recent polling suggests. Meanwhile, his rhetorical emphasis on class and “bread-and-butter issues” appears more electorally expedient than Clinton’s 2016 emphasis on Trump’s unfitness for office/a cosmopolitan conception of American identity. And he’d help minimize the threat of a left-wing third-party challenger (albeit potentially increasing the threat of a centrist one).

Ezekiel: I don’t have a good answer to that, I’ll be honest. Right now I feel like loosely attached indie voters might be more attracted to Sanders, but I’m not sure what will happen to that if he were to actually be in a general election with Trump. I can imagine diminished enthusiasm with bundlers and donors being a problem — it kind of depends on how strongly the Establishment would rally to him if he were to win. A lot of unknowns."

Other candidates have shown frustration in recent weeks at the rise of the 37-year-old mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city, taking aim at his relative inexperience and his struggle to attract black voters. The crowded debate stage Wednesday, featuring 10 Democratic contenders, could provide ample opportunity for that rancor to boil over.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who like Buttigieg is pitching herself as a Midwestern pragmatist, has tried to differentiate herself from him by emphasizing she is “the one from the Midwest that’s actually won in a statewide race over and over again.”

Klobuchar has also questioned whether a woman with Buttigieg’s level of experience would be enjoying the same success or attention. “Of the women on the stage . . . do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,” Klobuchar told CNN earlier this month. “Maybe we’re held to a different standard.”

AD

AD

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), meanwhile, seemed taken aback this week to learn Buttigieg had used a stock photo of a mother and child in Kenya to promote his proposal for black Americans and suggested it showed he was ill equipped to lead a diverse country.

“He’s going to have to answer for that,” Harris said after laughing. “The Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are as the diversity of the American people.”



The Buttigieg campaign declined to comment for this article, though his senior communications adviser hinted that his advisers were expecting Buttigieg to be a debate target. She tweeted a “Game of Thrones” image of Jon Snow, one of the saga’s heroes, fending off an onslaught of attackers.

AD

The South Bend mayor entered the race as a little-known figure, but he recently surged to first place in a poll of Iowa voters and has been rising in New Hampshire. At the same time, Quinnipiac University’s newest South Carolina poll showed Buttigieg with less than one percent support among black voters, prompting questions about whether he can galvanize the Democratic Party’s diverse base.

AD

Wednesday’s debate, sponsored by The Washington Post and MSNBC, comes at a turbulent political moment as the capital is consumed with impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The Democratic race itself remains fluid, with several candidates dropping out in recent months and others making last-minute entries, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and potentially former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.

That murkiness has some Democratic donors and strategists fretting that the primary could languish for months with no clear winner. So far, Democrats have engaged in a game of shoot the leader: First Biden, then Harris, then Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have seen surges of momentum, only to attract sharp attacks from their rivals on the debate stage.

AD

It is unclear whether Warren will join any such verbal assaults on Buttigieg on Wednesday. For weeks, the mayor has been running ads that criticize Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for their embrace of a Medicare-for-all health plan, and he has denigrated Warren’s position as “my way or the highway.”

AD

Buttigieg leveled some of the sharpest attacks on Warren in the last debate. Warren’s style has been to avoid directly criticizing Buttigieg — or the other Democrats — but she recently sharpened her stump speech to criticize candidates who take corporate donations and offer proposals that “nibble around the edges.”

“I’m not running some consultant-driven campaign with proposals that have been carefully crafted not to offend big donors,” Warren said at a town hall in North Las Vegas on Sunday, in a comment seen by many as a shot at Buttigieg. “I passed that point a long time ago.”

AD

She added that the Democratic nominee needed “big ideas” to inspire voters and to help those who need it most. Buttigieg, like Biden, has proposed a government-run health plan as an option, rather than making it universal and mandatory, as under Medicare-for-all.

AD

“I get it. It’s easy to give up on big ideas. You can make yourself so smart and so sophisticated,” Warren said. “But here’s the thing: When we give up on those big ideas, we give up on the people who would be touched by those ideas.”

Biden, who has been slipping in the Iowa polls, has mostly used a light touch in dealing with Buttigieg, though he has tried to take back the phrase “Medicare for all who want it” — first used by Buttigieg’s campaign — as an approach he came up with first.

AD

Biden will have to decide whether to go further than that Wednesday. A Biden supporter this week circulated video of Buttigieg speaking at a tea party event in 2010, expressing the possibility of finding common ground with the deeply conservative group as he campaigned for Indiana state treasurer. The tea party is anathema to many Democratic voters.

AD

Though Buttigieg has not directly attacked Biden, he has unmistakably presented himself as an alternative to the former vice president in courting the Democratic Party’s centrist wing, and at times he has referred to “the failures of the old normal.”

Buttigieg may be most vulnerable Wednesday on issues of race. He comes into the debate fresh from a controversy in which his campaign touted the backing of more than 400 South Carolinians for his “Douglass Plan for Black Americans,” even if they did not endorse Buttigieg himself. That led some signatories to feel their positions had been misrepresented.

AD

Last week, Johnnie Cordero, chairman of the Democratic Black Caucus of South Carolina, told the Intercept that the Buttigieg campaign had used his name prominently even though he had not endorsed the plan. Two other black leaders also expressed reservations about how the campaign had characterized their support.

AD

For days, the campaign insisted it had done nothing wrong, but on Monday, Buttigieg called the incident a “miscommunication” and a “learning experience,” according to NBC News.

“We have a lot of people who are supporting [the Douglass Plan] but a few people who didn’t believe the message reflected their support,” Buttigieg said. “So we are clearing that up.”

AD

Meanwhile, it also emerged that Buttigieg’s campaign had used a stock photo of a woman and child in Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan; the campaign said the images have since been removed from its website and apologized for their inclusion.

On Monday, Harris responded forcefully when reporters asked her to weigh in on the controversy, after initially seeming surprised. “I’m sure someone agrees that was a big mistake,” Harris said. “He’s going to have to answer for that. It’s — I don’t have words to describe that.”

AD

In his continued efforts to court black voters, Buttigieg on Monday addressed an audience made up largely of students from historically black Morehouse and Spelman colleges in Atlanta. He cited former Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and her work on voting rights, while facing questions about the fallout in South Bend when a white police officer shot a black resident earlier this year.

Buttigieg was light on details, often answering with phrases like “There’s no easy fix for that” or “We’re not going to solve it all today.”

That left Spelman freshman Kyra Gines wanting more, especially when it comes to details of the Douglass Plan.

“I think he’s good at being a politician,” Gines said. “He knew his audience well, and he knew the buzz lines that would do well . . . . In terms of actual content, I think there were some things to be desired in how he stepped around questions. But again, that’s politicians.”

Even candidates who failed to qualify for the debate stage have joined in the criticism of Buttigieg, sometimes expressing disbelief that a candidate with such a short resume has pushed them out of the spotlight.

At a Friday house party in Nashua, N.H., Colorado Sen. Michael F. Bennet joked about South Bend’s small size.

“The school district that I ran had a budget three times the size of South Bend, which is substantial,” said Bennet, who once headed Denver’s school district. “I’ve won two national elections in a swing state. I won more votes than any politician has ever won in the state of Colorado, the last time I ran.”

He added, “Mayor Pete won eight thousand votes the last time he ran for mayor. I’m not denigrating it, but it’s a very different set of experiences.”"

That might generate some tense moments for a front-runner, but do not be surprised if the leaders flick away a minor candidate, focusing on his or her main competition.

Second, the debates have been helpful to one ideological side in the Democratic Party: The moderates. In September’s debate, Warren was challenged on how to pay for her health-care plan without taxing the middle class. That forced her to unveil her gargantuan Medicare-for-all plan, which in turn may have contributed to her slide. Warren may get attacked from both sides, from moderates chiding her for trying to drum them out of the party for advancing a plan that now looks like hers (a public option as a first step) and from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been on a bit of a comeback since his heart attack and could well accuse Warren of losing her nerve.

AD

AD

Third, we will see if the moderates — enjoying a resurgence of late in part due to the adverse reaction to Warren’s health-care plan and in part because of polling suggesting far-left proposals may put the Midwest at risk for Democrats — continue to pummel Warren or if they pivot to attack Buttigieg, whose climb in early state polls poses a threat to Biden and those seeking to be the Biden-alternative if the former vice president fades. The moderates do not want to fall into the trap of alienating the progressive side of the party so it is very likely they’ll react to Warren but let Sanders and the moderators grill her on her health-care position.

Alternatively, Warren and Sanders have the chance to push back, defend their “big structural change” and once more criticize their fellow Democrats as insufficiently bold. If they back down, trying to appeal to some of those moderate voters, it will be a sure sign that they’ve realized their success depends on broadening their base.

They may want to consider a new Gallup poll showing: “Six in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer to see the party nominate the candidate with the best chance of beating President Donald Trump, even if that person does not share their views on key issues. By contrast, 36% say they would rather have the reverse: a candidate aligned with them on almost all the issues they care about, even if that person is not the most electable.” The argument that Warren has made herself less electable by tying herself to Medicare-for-all may be the central problem with her campaign at this point.

AD

AD

We also will look to see if foreign policy, in light of the impeachment hearings and the Syria debacle, plays a significant role in the debate. (Politico reports: “The withdrawal and incursion allowed [the Islamic State] to ‘reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad,’ the quarterly report from the lead inspector general on the U.S. military campaign against ISIS stated.”) Candidates who want to pull out of the Middle East may be forced to explain how their approach is any better than Trump’s.

Buttigieg has been speaking more about his service recently (partially because of the Veterans Day holiday). Don’t be surprised if he throws a punch against Republicans who have been challenging the loyalty and patriotism of witnesses such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who created a viral moment on Tuesday, even evoking applause from the audience:

Buttigieg feels more comfortable talking about foreign policy and the military than many of his opponents, so the more he can defend U.S. foreign policy goals (e.g., protecting Europe against Russia) the more he will be playing to his strength while showing how he would take it to President Trump in the general election.

AD

AD

Finally, this is the first debate in presidential history in which all the moderators are women (not to mention four of the 10 debaters). We will see if they collectively raise topics that have largely been ignored in earlier debates — K-12 education, child care, pay equity, the opioid epidemic and sexual assault in the military. There is no more important group to Democrats than women, especially suburban women, yet many issues of concern to them have not been fully addressed.

Joe Biden. Biden’s plan would create a new government insurer — a so-called “public option” — that would compete with private insurance companies in the open market. This new government insurer would give health insurance to millions of Americans and aim to drive down exorbitant costs by creating competition. This differs from a “Medicare-for-all” system in which all existing insurance systems are folded into one single-payer plan.

Biden’s plan would not be as disruptive or expensive as single-payer, but it would also leave millions of Americans without health insurance and not eliminate medical bills.

Biden’s plan would automatically enroll in the government plan the approximately 5 million Americans who live in poverty in states that did not expand Medicaid. He would also make the federal subsidies under Obamacare substantially more generous, giving middle-class tax credits to reduce their premium charges. His plan contains other changes, such as outlawing surprise medical billing, using antitrust powers to break up health-care corporations and limiting prescription drug prices.

Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg’s plan is similar to Biden’s: Both would create a new public option that competes with private insurers. Both would enhance federal tax credits under Obamacare for middle-class health-care costs. And both would leave private insurance largely untouched.

Buttigieg proposes doing more than Biden in a few small but important ways. Unlike Biden, Buttigieg is also pushing a hard cap on out-of-pocket costs for seniors in the existing Medicare system.

Perhaps the key difference between these moderates is that Buttigieg would automatically enroll people in plans on the public option if they’re eligible. He is silent on what happens to people who refuse to pay after being automatically enrolled, but says he will create a backstop fund to pay providers “for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured.”

Buttigieg’s plan, like Biden’s, is estimated to cost about $1 trillion over 10 years, far less than the $30 trillion sticker shock that comes with the liberals’ single-payer plans.

Elizabeth Warren. Rhetorically, Warren has aligned herself with Sanders’s “Medicare-for-all” proposal to establish a single-payer system. But she has proposed that America first approve a public option and not pass a single-payer system until the third year of her administration.

Warren’s public option would be substantially more aggressive than that of either Biden or Buttigieg. She would automatically enroll everyone younger than 18 into the plan and not charge them any premiums, guaranteeing free insurance to all children. It would also be free for everyone earning 200 percent of the federal poverty line (about $51,000 for a family of four). The existing Medicare program would also expand dental benefits to its existing population.

But Warren’s plan stops short, at least until year three, of pushing for a single-payer plan that would move all Americans — including the 150 million or so who get their insurance through their employer — onto the government plan.

Unlike Sanders, Warren has insisted she can pay for single-payer without raising taxes on the middle class, instead putting the burden on the wealthy and businesses. Some economists have questioned that claim.

Bernie Sanders. Sanders’ plan, the most aggressive in the race, would amount to the biggest transformation of the American health-care system in the country’s history.

Under this Medicare-for-all system, every American would be guaranteed medical, dental, vision and auditory care with virtually no deductibles, premiums or co-payments of any form. There is no apparent limit on how many times people could go to the doctor or the dentist and have the government pick up the tab."

The reporters will interview and remain in touch with residents in the counties as the race progresses, and the stories will appear on NBC News, MSNBC, NBC News Now. There also will be online features with information on the counties and why they were selected.

This project differs from the mountain of Trump-supporters-in-a-diner story in that it will presumably interview Democrats, Republicans, and independents. But the logic is the same: This relatively small number of Americans are the ones who really matter.

But isn’t it true that those voters really are more important? They’re going to decide the election! In one sense, that’s true. The trouble is that it takes the the twisted logic of the electoral college — which says that the only voters whose opinions are worthy of concern are the ones who live in about a half-dozen swing states — and turns it into a news template. It reifies and justifies one of the most undemocratic features of our electoral system.

If you live in Texas or California or South Dakota or New York or Oregon or Mississippi or any other state where the presidential election is unlikely to be close, you just aren’t that important. Journalists will not be nudging into your booth to pepper you with questions about what you’re worried or hopeful about. They will not treat you and your neighbors like gods of democracy whose whims should and will decide the fate of the nation. You’re just background noise, something the savvy among us know to ignore.

But how will we know how the election is going to turn out if we don’t spend time talking to those precious swing voters in those precious swing counties in those precious swing states?

AD

AD

Here’s a crazy idea: What if predicting the outcome of the election is not actually the most important thing to spend your time worrying about?

It’s not that we shouldn’t wonder how the election will turn out at all. It’s unavoidable. And it’s perfectly fine to think about it (and report about it, and write about it, and talk about it) sometimes. Anyone who works in politics in any way will tell you that when they talk to friends and relatives, the first question everyone has is “What’s going to happen?”

But that’s a tendency to be tempered, even fought against, not embraced wholeheartedly. We can spend all our time trying to predict what will happen, or we can worry about what’s actually important, like what all Americans are concerned about, and what the challenges of governing will be, and what problems need addressing, and how candidates’ proposed policies will affect people’s lives.

AD

AD

Unfortunately, the primary process trains us to think in a particular way, which we then transfer to the general election. Right now the presidential candidates are pandering relentlessly to the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire. Many of them luxuriate in it; there are voters in those states who literally will not vote for a presidential candidate who didn’t meet them, shake their hand, look deeply into their eyes, and convince them of their sincerity.

It doesn’t help that the voters to whom we’ve given all this power are terribly unrepresentative of the country as a whole; alone among the presidential candidates, Julián Castro had the courage to note that Iowa is “not reflective of the diversity of our country, and certainly not reflective of the diversity of the Democratic Party.”

But after all that groveling before Iowans, it seems completely natural that the nominee will then turn to groveling before Wisconsinites and Michiganders. Still, even if that’s a necessary strategy for them to win the election, it doesn’t have to determine what the rest of us worry about.

ATLANTA — The month between the last Democratic debate and tomorrow's brought something new to the party's crowded primary: momentum.

Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar piled on Elizabeth Warren over how she'd pay for Medicare-for-all, and both began moving up in Iowa. Warren took their criticism seriously and rolled out both a payment plan and a transition plan that answered skeptics; for the first time, she declined slightly in the polls.

The result has been a shift in the contest for Iowa. Joe Biden entered the third debate leading in that state's polls. Warren entered the fourth debate having edged ahead of Biden. Buttigieg has now moved ahead, marginally, in a state that can elevate long-shot candidates. And some of the candidates onstage risk being cut out entirely from future debates, despite everything they've built so far. There are more desperate candidates than we've seen so far in these debates, and more candidates with something big to prove.

We don't know what direction moderators will take in this debate. We do know what to look for.

What does Buttigieg do under pressure? Buttigieg is in the position that Warren held for months: a top contender for the nomination who has taken few hits onstage. The hits he did take came from candidates in decline (former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, who accused Buttigieg of lacking courage) or candidates disliked by most Democratic voters (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who tried to steer Buttigieg into a fight about military intervention in Syria). Buttigieg came out ahead every time and did what was impossible for weaker candidates: He went after Warren and improved his own favorable rating, framing his argument around her own reluctance to give a cost estimate for Medicare-for-all. (When she revealed one, he stopped attacking.)

Buttigieg's rivals can't let that happen again, but it's hard to define who those rivals are. Every other campaign has some level of contempt for the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Some have expressed it subtly, like Warren decrying “consultant-driven” campaigns; some have been more direct, like former HUD secretary Julián Castro warning that Buttigieg can't excite nonwhite voters.

Castro, of course, won't be onstage, but Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California will, and she's hinted at her own problems with Buttigieg. In Las Vegas, at a Monday forum on racial justice that Buttigieg did not attend, Harris noted that she did not “just acquire the language to talk about” race. Afterward, she piled on Buttigieg for releasing a “Douglass plan” for black America that touted support from activists who had not actually endorsed it and was published alongside a stock photo of a mother and child in Kenya.

“I don't have words to describe that,” Harris said.

In the past, Buttigieg has gotten around tough questions with the help of rival candidates who didn't want to attack him. At the first debate, in June, he responded to a question about racial tensions and a disproportionately white police force in South Bend by admitting that he hadn't fixed the problem. Blink-and-you-missed-him candidate Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) pounced, but no one else did.

Can Elizabeth Warren fight from a corner? The Massachusetts senator's slip in the polls could benefit her in one small way: It's put more pressure on Buttigieg. Candidates have only so much time to tangle, and in debates so far, Warren has not been attacked on several story lines that Democrats see as vulnerabilities: her corporate legal advice, her late-in-life membership with the party, her past claims of Native American ancestry.

Nothing is preventing her rivals from going after those things, and Biden spent the better part of two weeks attacking Warren for an “elitist attitude” after she accused his campaign of issuing “Republican talking points” on Medicare-for-all. That fight was notable, because it was the first that Warren seemed to start: Exasperated by the accusations of fuzzy math, she said Democrats who attacked universal Medicare were running in the “wrong primary.” Warren never used that language again and instead spent weeks sketching out a comprehensive transition plan for single-payer health care.

The old question for Warren — how would she pay for Medicare-for-all? — is no longer operative. It has been replaced by potential questions about whether her math holds up, whether she can be trusted to stick to a position and whether, Pete Buttigieg's campaign has suggested, her plan simply mirrors his. There are substantial differences in the plans, and not much of an appetite for another hour of Medicare-for-all infighting, especially when Biden is ready to dismiss all of it as a needless, radical rejection of President Barack Obama's legacy. Warren's campaign has readied itself for attacks on her past and has been occasionally surprised when they haven't come.

Does Sanders still treat Warren like a partner? The two senators representing the party's left wing have played supportive roles in most of their time onstage. There was just one exception, in last month's debate, when moderators asked Sanders whether Medicare-for-all would raise middle-class taxes. “I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,” Sanders said, putting more pressure on Warren. (“At least that's a straightforward answer,” Buttigieg snarked.)

Since then, Sanders has gotten many more chances to criticize Warren and taken just a few, avoiding the harsh tone of some of his supporters. After she introduced her plan to pay for Medicare-for-all, Sanders said that simply raising progressive income taxes was a better way of funding universal health care; Warren's employer tax, he said, could cost jobs. On the day she introduced her transition plan, Sanders was accepting the support of the pro-single-payer National Nurses United: He said that unlike Warren, he would introduce his Medicare-for-all legislation on the first day of his presidency and fight for the entire package to be passed, “not put it off for several years.”

For the first time, Sanders and Warren do have slightly different plans: Warren would use her first budget to begin enrolling people in an expanded version of Medicare but not end duplicative private insurance until three years later. The question is whether Sanders, who is generally viewed by voters as more trustworthy than Warren, explores that question or defends the overall goal of his legislation, shared by Warren, against all comers.

If he decides that he can benefit if Warren gets tangled up onstage, it would represent the first major break between them. He has far more to argue about with Biden and Buttigieg, starting with Biden's 180-degree flip on super PACs and continuing with Buttigieg's adoption of the “Medicare-for-all” brand into “Medicare-for-all who want it.” At the same time, his campaign sees an advantage in Buttigieg's rise, as it cuts off white Democrats with college degrees from Warren.

Does Joe Biden (finally) assuage some doubts? There's a way this debate goes well for Biden; if it does, that would be a first. The impression that Biden is slowing down, and less ready to tackle President Trump than Democrats might have wanted, has grown with each debate night. Neither he nor Warren benefited from the Medicare-for-all fight, and he got past a round about Hunter Biden's work largely because the other candidates decided not to keep it going. Paradoxically, though Biden still leads in national and later-state polling, his rivals do not treat him like a threat.

That leaves a lot up to moderators. Biden could be asked about the policies where he breaks with Democratic voters, like marijuana legalization; he could be asked to pick up the argument with Warren, something he's not always done with gusto. He has, so far, declined to attack Warren on her short history with the Democratic Party, even though his campaign has gone there. Under pressure, Biden has often gotten defensive about his record, and none of those incidents (such as turning to Warren and near-shouting that he got her the votes for the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau) has gone well for him. Biden has no ideological problem with the party's voters; he has a style and presentation problem, which a good debate could fix.

Is Gabbard still running against Hillary Clinton? Believe it or not, Gabbard's argument with Hillary Clinton, the highest-profile moment of her campaign, happened in the five short weeks between the last debate and this one. The Hawaii congresswoman is still talking about Clinton claiming that Republicans were “grooming” her for a third-party spoiler run and still framing her candidacy as a challenge to the “Trump-Clinton doctrine.” She has studiously refused to attack Biden, who shares Clinton's foreign policy record, and has looked for chances to probe whether Warren or Buttigieg would endorse American military adventurism.

Gabbard entered the fourth debate with high expectations, some set by her campaign. She didn't deliver, as an attempt to challenge Warren's “commander in chief” credentials was cut short and as Warren seemed to surprise her by agreeing that America should reduce its presence in the Middle East. Gabbard is also in the same position as Harris and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey on Medicare-for-all: She has co-sponsored the bill but doesn't promise to implement it in full. Since the Clinton spat, Gabbard's poll numbers with Democrats have fallen as her numbers with independents and Republicans have spiked, so her ability to get on the next debate stage wouldn't be hurt if she went negative.

What do the on-the-bubble candidates try? Three of the candidates onstage tomorrow have not yet qualified for December's debate: Gabbard, Booker and Andrew Yang. (Tom Steyer qualified this week on the strength of his numbers in a new South Carolina poll.) Only one of those candidates, Booker, has yet to hit December's qualifying number in a single poll. And he has given every indication that he'll stay positive, while possibly contrasting himself with candidates who get accused of shifting to win votes.

“I'm not focus-grouping and poll-testing who I am,” Booker said this weekend in Las Vegas. “The person you've been seeing on those debate stages is the person I am.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has qualified for December's debate on the strength of strong Iowa polling, but she's got a different problem: Her growth in Iowa has run up against the enthusiasm for Buttigieg. Klobuchar, even more than most Democrats, resents how Buttigieg has positioned himself as a pragmatist after flirting with the party's left.

What curveballs come from the moderators? Seriously, all that time debating Medicare-for-all has shrunk the opportunities to ask candidates about the rest of their agenda, or the world they'd confront as president. This could be an opportunity to ask about the Trump administration dropping America's opposition to Israel's settlements, about the political crisis in Bolivia, about how Warren and Sanders would ban fracking without abandoning the goal of energy independence, about whether mostly-white states should hold the first two contests.

Yes, The Washington Post is co-sponsoring the debate, but the moderators aren't saying a word of it to reporters. We'll just have to watch. (Which you can do at washingtonpost.com starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time; the debate starts at 9 p.m.)

DEBATE SEASON

Seventeen Democrats are actively seeking the party's presidential nomination. There will be only 10 on the Tyler Perry Studios stage. The field of seven left-out candidates includes the one who has been running the longest (John Delaney, 844 days) and the one who has been running for less than a week (Deval Patrick, five days).

None of these Democrats are on track to make December's debate. Instead, they're learning the art of dismissiveness. Patrick told reporters in New Hampshire that the tone of the debates made him happier about being left out, a sentiment he repeated a couple of days later in Las Vegas.

“I'm not sure it's something you want to aspire to, because the format is just really, really hard as a means to communicate with the public,” Patrick said.

The former Massachusetts governor would keep campaigning as the debate went forward, as would Colorado Sen. Michael F. Bennet, who had even criticized the DNCs polls and donors debate thresholds at the party's summer meeting in San Francisco.

“I think the debates have been very unhelpful to the party and unhelpful the country,” Bennet said in an interview. “I recognize that this should be part of the process, but I don't think they should be given that kind of weight that they've been given. And I believe that the DNC made huge mistakes in the way they set it up.”

Of all the Democrats left out of the debate, only one, Julián Castro, made the trip to Atlanta, where he'll sit for a Tuesday night interview with Angela Rye. Delaney will be back in Iowa this week for a town hall, as will Marianne Williamson; Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is in New York, then his home state, making himself available to media. Joe Sestak, who has continued to get speaking slots at party events, has no public plans.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

American Action Network, “Clear.” The star of a new seven-figure campaign against impeachment is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and it's because of something she didn't really say. In a CNN interview last week, Ocasio-Cortez largely stuck to the party's preferred messaging: that an impeachment inquiry was necessary because the president seemed ready to pressure more foreign governments to intervene in American elections. “We’re talking about the potential compromise of the 2020 elections,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “This is not just about something that has occurred; this is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.”

Republicans pretended that the “disastrous outcome” was a Trump reelection, and this ad picks up the baton, starting Ocasio-Cortez's quote near the end to blast Democrats for a “partisan impeachment.” From there, it accuses swing-district Democrats of not letting “the voters decide” elections or of working on anything but impeachment.

Jewish Democratic Council of America, “Trump is the Biggest Threat to Jewish Voters.” This spot is ramping up the JDCA's 2020 effort, with a goal of 14 swing-state campaigns. The initial message is the kitchen sink, starting with the 2017 white-nationalist march on Charlottesville, cutting to Trump's “very fine people on both sides” remark (ripped out of context, but not much better in context). Jewish voters are already opposed to Trump, but the ad brackets any positive messages they might hear on Israel with the president's more damaging quotes.

Elizabeth Warren, “Social Security.” The last of the high-polling Democrats to go on the air in Iowa, Warren is getting started with an advertisement for one of her oldest plans: Social Security benefits expansion. It's been a liberal goal for years, endorsed by Warren before the end of her first year in the Senate, and it fits the Warren mold: Explaining it takes very little time and flashes dollar amounts on-screen. Sanders, the other competitor for left-wing voters in Iowa, has lagged with voters over 65; Warren is aiming right for them, though Sanders also supports this policy.

Steve Bullock, “Justice.” The Montana governor introduced himself in Iowa by highlighting his electoral wins — three in a Trump-won state, if anyone hadn't heard. The new ad promises something else: a Bullock Department of Justice that would continue to prosecute Trump officials after the president's term ends. “After I beat Trump, I'll empower prosecutors to follow the evidence all the way to the top,” Bullock says into the camera.

South Carolina primary (University of North Florida, 436 likely voters)

Joe Biden: 36%

Elizabeth Warren: 10%

Bernie Sanders: 10%

Tom Steyer: 8%

Marianne Williamson: 1%

Andrew Yang: 1%

The first Southern primary, and every other Southern primary that gets polled, finds the same basic story: a solid lead for Biden based on a lopsided advantage with black voters. UNF's first look at the race differs from other recent polls in how it finds Biden narrowly ahead with white voters, with whom he's been relatively weak, in the South and elsewhere. Steyer's strength, which has appeared in other polls of early states with less competition by other candidates, demonstrates just how much he has bought with an ad campaign: To date he has spent around $8.5 million on TV, radio and digital ads targeting South Carolina. That's bigger than the overall ad budget for his competitors.

South Carolina black voters who “haven't heard enough” about candidate (Quinnipiac, 768 likely voters)

Joe Biden: 11%

Bernie Sanders: 12%

Elizabeth Warren: 37%

Kamala D. Harris: 42%

Cory Booker: 45%

Amy Klobuchar: 67%

Mike Bloomberg: 68%

Andrew Yang: 72%

Tulsi Gabbard: 77%

Deval Patrick: 80%

Biden's rivals have tended to blow off his South Carolina poll numbers by imagining a day when black voters take them more seriously. As the year has rolled on, that's become a little harder to do; every image of a Buttigieg or Warren rally that's more white than black seems to disprove the point. But this poll, which finds another Biden lead overall, does suggest that South Carolina's black voters are less aware of their alternatives than, say, the average voter in Iowa. While 83 percent of South Carolina whites have heard enough about Warren to form an opinion, just 61 percent of black voters say the same. Two in three white voters have formed an opinion of Buttigieg; just one in three black voters have.

Would you be enthusiastic about voting for each of this kind of candidate? (NPR/PBS, 453 Democratic voters)

A woman: 83%

A gay man or lesbian: 69%

Someone under 40: 62%

A white man: 53%

A socialist: 37%

A business executive: 34%

Someone over 70: 31%

The reasons many Democratic voters are cool on Biden and ready to roll the dice on Buttigieg are laid out here. In 2008 and 2016, Democrats picked history-making nominees, and they liked it. The thought of elevating an elderly candidate or a white man is much less exciting to them; the thought of a businessman who could run from outside the system doesn't click at all.

IN THE STATES

Colorado. Andrew Romanoff, who has emerged as the most serious challenger to John Hickenlooper in the Democrats' U.S. Senate primary, won the support of the Sunrise Movement this week, a climate action group. Whoever wins the party's nomination will challenge Sen. Cory Gardner, widely viewed as the most vulnerable Republican member of the Senate.

“Electing Romanoff to the Senate would be game-changing in fighting the climate crisis,” said Varshini Prakash, Sunrise’s co-founder and executive director, in a statement. “Hickenlooper and Gardner are both in cahoots with the billionaires who got us into this mess.”

Hickenlooper’s problems with climate voters are many; for Sunrise, the final blow was his refusal to sign a popular pledge rejecting support from the fossil fuel industry. “We can’t frack our way out of this crisis,” Romanoff said, “or allow Big Oil to bankroll Congress and block reform.”

Delaware. Jessica Scarane announced a primary challenge to Sen. Chris Coons, who won a special election in a 2010 upset and easily held his seat in the Republican wave of 2014. In a talk with the Intercept, she said she’d focus on Coons’s vote to confirm Trump’s second HHS secretary, Alex Azar, and a head-turning Coons speech from earlier this year where he worried that the Senate’s diversity hurt its ability to come together. “It definitely makes people stop and think and really question why he would believe that,” Scarane said.

Donald Trump. He abandoned plans to ban many flavored varieties of vapes, backing down from a surprise announcement after a coalition of conservatives — and even his campaign manager — warned that going ahead could cost him votes.

Elizabeth Warren. She unveiled a plan to “fight back against white-nationalist violence,"" which includes more funding for investigative work as well as moves to decouple law enforcement and immigration enforcement — an end, for example, to the ""secure communities"" program.

Bernie Sanders. He announced his 4 millionth individual donation on the cusp of the debate, hitting a mark it took several more months to reach during his 2016 campaign.

Cory Booker. He published a New York Times op-ed warning against “dogmatic” opposition to charter schools, an issue that has hurt his campaign, as teachers unions have generally shown more interest in Warren and Sanders.

Mike Bloomberg. The not-yet-official candidate won the endorsement of Columbia, S.C., Mayor Steve Benjamin, a sought-after Democratic surrogate in the state. “He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,” Benjamin told the AP's Meg Kinnard.

Deval Patrick. He told reporters in Las Vegas that he was not “going to ignore Alabama and Arkansas,” where he failed to file in time to make the ballot. “We will have organizations and a presence on the ground to the extent we can.”

Lincoln Chafee. He visited the Libertarian Party's convention in Florida, becoming a member of the party, in what could be a move toward seeking its 2020 presidential nomination.

Kamala D. Harris. She previewed a possible argument against her opponents in an interview with Power 106 FM in Los Angeles, arguing that she’d led on criminal justice reform when other Democrats were timid. “Where were these people, and I’m talking about the people on the debate stage, back in the early 2000s?” she asked. “I was doing the work.”

Joe Biden. He notched another congressional endorsement, from Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a leader of the moderate Blue Dog Democrats. ""I know that Joe can win in tough districts all across this country, giving Democrats a lift up and down the ballot,"" Schrader said. ""And once in office, Joe is the one candidate who has what it takes to work with the other side to get real things done.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Katie Hill had been a Democratic star, a co-president of her freshman class, whose nine-point win in California’s 25th Congressional District told the story her party believed about its suburban future. Her shock resignation did not rattle Democrats too badly; Christy Smith, a new member of California’s state Assembly, jumped into the race, and no other credible candidate emerged to challenge her.

That changed last week, when Cenk Uygur, the brash host of the Young Turks news network, told viewers that he would run for Hill’s open seat. Uygur, who quickly raised more than $300,000, described a race that would prove his brand of left-wing politics could play everywhere — in the Bronx, in flyover country, in the suburbs. (Smith had raised $100,000 in her first 24 hours as a candidate.)

“We’re going to end this fiction that purple districts love corporate donors,” Uygur said in an interview. “You can go with the Republicans, who are going to do tax cuts for the rich. Everybody knows that. You can go for a standard establishment politician, who is going to do as the party dictates. Or you can go with me.”

Uygur, who had co-founded Justice Democrats after the 2016 election, played a role in some of 2018’s upsets, such as the victory of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She defeated the fourth-ranking Democrat in House leadership, but Uygur’s task looked even harder. He did not live in the district and was urging its voters to replace Katie Hill with a tough-talking man. Hill herself had quickly endorsed Smith.

“We flipped the district forever,” Hill said at this past weekend’s Democratic convention in Long Beach, Calif. “We are going to make sure it stays with a woman.”

Since entering the race, Uygur, who has made it his mission to replace “corporate” Democrats, has been under steady attack from Democratic clubs that had been lining up behind Smith. The strategy is simple: Define Uygur, for the voters who don’t know him, as a sexist loudmouth with no business running for Congress.

The opposition research is brief, focused on tweets and video clips from Uygur’s career. Democrats for Israel went after him for a clip where he said that religious fundamentalists “teach their kids things that are loony tunes.” Stonewall Young Democrats attacked a 2010 clip in which Uygur joked about whether it was possible for men to be sexually harassed.

“Uygur's comments reflect more of Donald Trump's hate speech than anything else,” Stonewall Young Democrats wrote. “Uygur's despicable remarks have no place in our discourse.”

These weren’t groups with big clout in the district, but the Simi Valley and Los Angeles Democrats quickly joined in, condemning Uygur over those quotes and sharing a 2017 article about Justice Democrats cutting ties with its co-founder over sexist blog posts he’d written more than a decade earlier.

Uygur’s response, so far, has been contrition about the blog posts — “I’ll never get tired of apologizing for that” — and outrage at the coordinated attacks.

“This is classic oppo research,” he said. “The reason they want to do that is that they don’t want to talk about the issues. When I talk about bribery, I become public enemy number one. My opponent doesn’t want Medicare-for-all, she doesn’t want a Green New Deal, and she doesn’t want to talk about lobbyist money. I call those bribes.”

One of the attacks on Uygur has echoed the Democrats’ presidential primary, as Smith-supporting clubs have highlighted her opponent’s criticism of Barack Obama. As co-host of TYT’s flagship show, Uygur repeatedly went after the 44th president as too timid to deliver on the left’s priorities.

“Yes, I have criticized Barack Obama from the left many times,” Uygur said. “I am not embarrassed about it. I’d do it again. Let’s note the irony that the two lines of attack from oppo is that I’m too conservative and I’m too progressive. Fine. If they think me pushing Obama to do single-payer was too progressive, guilty as charged.”

Smith, who has not engaged with every Uygur accusation, is politically closer to Hill than to Justice Democrats. Hill did not endorse the Green New Deal resolution, though she did endorse Medicare-for-all legislation. In a statement, Smith said that Uygur had already talked himself out of the race.

“None of my opponent’s racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and downright offensive statements are in keeping with the values of our community,” Smith said. “I’m not sure how to rank what is most damning of his commentary, but the most disqualifying to me was the night of the Saugus High School shooting when he boasted about his fundraising totals while I was with grieving families and students. He is not fit to serve anywhere, least of all a district where he doesn’t even live.”

But, as often happens at her public appearances, a question came up: Would she be willing to serve as vice president?

“I’m happy to do so,” she said, to applause and cheers from the crowd.

AD

Abrams’s Iowa appearance points to the delicate needle she has been threading since her 2018 loss — even as she has declined to run for Senate, saying she wants to focus on voting rights, she has remained a top-tier player in the Democratic Party, frequently mentioned as a potential vice president.

AD

It’s speculation she herself has encouraged. Asked about it during a talk at a church in Washington in September, Abrams said it would be “disingenuous” to say she wasn’t interested in the role. “I’m pretty good at campaigning,” she said, also citing her experience in politics, business and activism.

Her ties to the Democratic leaders, converging on Atlanta this week for the presidential debate, are clear. She is friends with some of the candidates, and has advised others. On Monday, her organization announced that Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang would help contact Georgia voters in danger of being purged from the voting rolls later this week.

AD

Even former president Barack Obama has sung her praises, telling a conference of major Democratic donors recently, “I love me some Stacey Abrams.”

AD

Abrams as vice president would have once seemed far-fetched, said Joel K. Goldstein, a professor at St. Louis University School of Law who studies the vice presidency. Over the past 40 years, he said, vice presidential candidates have had an average of more than 14 years in Congress or as governor.

But, he noted, the 2020 candidates for the Democratic nomination have an unusually wide range of experience. Buttigieg is a two-term mayor of a city of about 100,000. Yang has never served in government. So the fact that Abrams has no national political experience (she served for 10 years in the Georgia state House, including as minority leader) is less of a liability.

AD

Goldstein also said Abrams is the rare political figure that answers honestly, and enthusiastically, that she is interested in being considered for vice president. “I think being as open about it as she is is a way of keeping herself in the conversation,” Goldstein said. He also noted that she is seen as an “impressive” political leader. Along with being a black woman and a Southerner, that could make her an attractive running mate, especially for an older white man.

AD

Abrams’s political future has been the source of much political speculation. For a time earlier this year, Abrams said she considered running for president, accelerating the 2028 timeline she laid out in her book, “Lead from the Outside.”

But in August, she said she would focus on voting rights. Her Fair Fight 2020 organization is helping Democrats in battleground states prepare for the fierce fight over access to the ballot. Virginia and Kentucky, where Democrats claimed major electoral victories this month, were among the states where Fair Fight had a presence.

AD

In Kentucky, Fair Fight gave the party $10,000, the maximum allowed, to print literature left at the homes of targeted voters with a phone number to call for election information. Mary Nishimuta, executive director of the state party, said the No. 1 question the hotline got was “Where do I go to vote?” Nishimuta said Abrams’s efforts contributed to the increased turnout, which helped Democrat Andy Beshear defeat Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.

AD

Abrams’s passion for this issue comes from personal experience. Her own gubernatorial election was plagued with numerous irregularities — hours-long waits because of malfunctioning voting machines, new voters being turned away because their registrations had been suspended, local officials tossing out absentee ballots because of problems with signatures — that may have prevented thousands of voters from casting ballots.

Republican lawmakers and conservatives dismiss her as a “sore loser” for refusing to concede last year’s election. They say what she calls voter suppression is merely an attempt to root out fraudulent activity in the process. The Georgia ethics commission launched an investigation into Abrams’s 2018 campaign, alleging “unlawful coordination” with third-party groups. Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams’s top aide, counters that the investigation is politically motivated and aimed at intimidating groups representing voters of color.

AD

Abrams says it doesn’t matter who’s running if their supporters can’t cast a ballot or have their votes counted. Her work toward that goal is more important than her own presidential run right now, she said.

AD

“My decision was premised on where I could make the strongest impact and where I could add the deepest value,” Abrams said. “My responsibility is not to be the person on the [debate] stage but to be the person who is making sure that no matter where you live in the United States that your right to vote is protected.”

Abrams is also trying to make sure people participate in next year’s census, particularly people of color, young people and the poor. Toward that goal, she created a group called Fair Count and recruited her sister, Jeanine Abrams McLean, to help lead it.

AD

McLean, who holds a doctorate in ecology, evolution and behavior, has worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on public health and population-based research. When Abrams asked her how best to “count everybody in the census in Georgia,” McLean did some studying and came back with ideas and strategies.

AD

Their plans include identifying and providing Internet access and tablets in community sites, such as churches, restaurants and barbershops, where people gather and might be motivated to go online and fill out census forms.

“I joke with her that she is the only person who could get me to quit my good government job to come and do this,” McLean said.

AD

Asked what she thinks her sister should do next, McLean laughed. “Stacey does what Stacey wants to do. . . . At end of the day, she makes her own decisions.”

Abrams has said that will include another run for office down the road.

National party leaders heavily courted her to run for Senate against freshman Republican Sen. David Perdue, up for reelection next year. Abrams demurred, saying that while she respects the role of the Senate, she no longer thinks the legislative process is the best place for her to affect change.

AD

Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, who followed Abrams’s decade in the Georgia legislature, including six years as Democratic leader in the state House, thinks Abrams will make another bid for governor in 2022. Running for Senate would have complicated that plan.

AD

Then, of course, there’s still the specter of Abrams running for vice president in 2020. Shelton Stromquist, a retired historian and activist who with his wife and several friends came to hear Abrams in Iowa City, said she would be an asset to any nominee.

“She’s obviously deeply principled. She can generate enthusiasm,” he said. He described the Georgia governor’s race as a “trial by fire.”

“It was a national race in some ways,” he said.

His wife, Ann Stromquist, said Abrams displayed “wisdom” by sitting out the presidential primary and focusing on voting rights.

“I think what she’s doing now is more important,” she said."

THE BIG IDEA: They were there to bat cleanup, but both the GOP’s witnesses on Tuesday afternoon instead provided fresh fodder for the impeachment case against President Trump.

Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, formally requested the testimony of Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, the National Security Council’s former senior director covering Russia and Ukraine.

Neither of the Republicans had any desire to blame the president who appointed them for any misconduct. Both insisted that they didn’t see him do anything illegal. Each seemed content to throw Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, and Gordon Sondland, the megadonor who became ambassador to the European Union and is testifying today, under the bus. But they also validated key testimony from other witnesses, deepened a damning fact pattern for Trump and said that the underlying conduct the president stands accused of would generally be inappropriate.

Volker said he “would have objected” if he knew at the time that Trump brought up Joe Biden repeatedly and specifically during the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. “I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question,” the former envoy proclaimed.

Volker said he drew a line between pushing for an investigation of the company Burisma versus an investigation of Hunter Biden, who once sat on the company’s board. “In retrospect I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,” he testified. “I don’t think raising the 2016 election or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories are … things that we should be pursuing.”

Trump’s former envoy also questioned the credibility of the sources that the former New York mayor seemed to rely on. “The allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and non-credible,” Volker said. “I have known Vice President Biden for 24 years. He is an honorable man, and I hold him in the highest regard.”

Volker said Trump never told him directly that the aid was being withheld unless the Ukrainians announced investigations. He said the president had expressed a “general negative view” of Ukraine that dated back to when he came onboard in 2017. Volker said this perception was somewhat understandable considering the Eastern European nation’s historic struggles with corruption.

But he also painted a picture of himself as out of the loop and unaware of the machinations happening behind the scenes. He said he connected Giuliani with a top aide to the new Ukrainian president because he hoped it would smooth the way for a White House meeting and improved bilateral ties. Eager to defend his own reputation, Volker was adamant that he never personally witnessed or participated in illegal conduct. “I was never involved with anything that I considered to be bribery at all,” he said. “Or extortion.”

-- Both Morrison and Volker said they believe it’s inappropriate for an American president to ask a foreign leader to investigate an American citizen. “I don’t believe it is appropriate for the president to do that,” Volker said in response to a question from Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.). “If we have law enforcement concerns with a U.S. citizen generally, there are appropriate channels for that.” Morrison said he agreed. Then Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) asked about a hypothetical scenario in which a mayor, governor or member of Congress withheld public funds from a law enforcement agency until it investigated his or her political rival. Morrison and Volker agreed that, too, would be improper.

-- Morrison said he reported details of the July 25 call to the National Security Council’s top lawyer. He said he worried about the political fallout if the call became public, not its legality, and insisted he wasn’t personally bothered by anything Trump said. “As I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington’s political climate,” he said. “My fears have been realized.” Morrison also acknowledged that Biden and Burisma were not on the talking points prepared for Trump in advance of the conversation and did not reflect official U.S. policy.

-- Morrison said he had a “sinking feeling” that the money Trump put a freeze on would expire if it wasn’t transferred to Ukraine by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. He noted that this would force the administration to explain to congressional appropriators why there had been a hold in the first place.

-- Morrison also testified that Sondland informed him that he had told a top aide to Volodymyr Zelensky “that the Ukrainians would have to have the prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted.” Under questioning by the Democratic counsel for the Intelligence Committee, Morrison said he was concerned that these were being identified as requirements.

-- Morrison said his predecessor Fiona Hill, who is testifying on Thursday, had warned him about the “Gordon problem,” referring to Sondland, when he took over. “I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing,” he explained. “I didn’t always act on things Gordon suggested [and] that he believed were important.”

-- Volker said he now remembers details of the July 10 meetings at the White House that he had forgotten, or omitted, during his closed-door deposition in October. Last month, he said there was no discussion of Giuliani or investigations and called the conversations uneventful. Other officials who were there have subsequently testified that John Bolton, then the national security adviser, abruptly ended a meeting in his office when Sondland broached the issue of investigations. On Tuesday, Volker said he now remembers that Sondland did, in fact, make “a general comment” about investigations, though he said it happened as the meeting was wrapping up anyway. “I think all of us thought it was inappropriate,” Volker said. “The conversation did not continue, and the meeting concluded.” Volker called it “something of an eye-roll moment.”

Volker said he still does not have any recollection of Sondland bringing up investigations a second time during a follow-up conversation with the visiting Ukrainians in the Ward Room of the White House. “I may have been engaged in a side conversation, or had already left the complex, because I do not recall further discussion regarding investigations or Burisma,” he said in his opening statement.

-- Volker and Morrison appeared together on an afternoon panel after the testimony of Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe. Williams said she thought the July 25 call was “unusual” because “it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.” She said no one in the national security firmament supported withholding the aid until Trump froze it. Vindman, the National Security Council’s European affairs director, said he considered the president’s request that Ukraine investigate Biden to be “inappropriate.” The Army officer argued that “it is improper” for Trump “to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.”

-- Interestingly, Morrison and Vindman agreed that moving the rough transcript of the July 25 call to a code-word-level server was not a big deal. But they disagreed on why it happened. Morrison said it was a mistake that resulted from an administrative error, but Vindman saw it as a deliberate attempt to hide a sensitive call. Vindman also said the omission of the word Burisma from the rough transcript of the call wasn’t nefarious but the result of the transcription software.

-- The White House issued a statement from Pence’s national security adviser Keith Kellogg that said Williams never “reported any personal or professional concerns” to him, her supervisor, regarding the call. “As an exceedingly proud member of President Trump’s Administration and as a 34-year highly experienced combat veteran who retired with the rank of Lieutenant General in the Army, I heard nothing wrong or improper on the call,” Kellogg said in the statement. “I had and have no concerns.”

MORE TEAM COVERAGE:

-- Sondland is testifying more bluntly this morning than he did during his previous deposition that Trump and Giuliani sought to condition a White House invite for Ukraine’s new president to demands that his country publicly launch investigations that could damage Trump’s political opponents. Aaron Davis reports: “I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo?’” Sondland said in his opening statement. “With regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.”

In his sworn opening statement, Trump’s ambassador also told the House Intelligence Committee that while he never knew for sure if the White House had frozen nearly $400 million in security assistance as part of the pressure campaign against Ukraine, he operated as if that was the case. “In the absence of any credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized,” Sondland said. “My belief was that if Ukraine did something to demonstrate a serious intention” to launch the investigations Trump wanted, “then the hold on military aid would be lifted.”

-- ""Sondland’s future — and possibly his freedom — could also rest on whether lawmakers believe he is telling the whole truth about his role and that of the president,"" Aaron and Rachael Bade report. ""Lawmakers in previous inquiries have referred witnesses to the Justice Department if they believe they have lied under oath.”

-- Here are five question The Fix's Amber Phillips wants Sondland to answer:

Was he acting of his own volition, or at Trump’s direction?

What did he say to Trump – and what did Trump tell him – on a July 26 phone call from Kyiv?

Sondland told the Ukrainians their military aid would come when their president made an “anti-corruption statement.” Was that code for investigations into the Bidens and 2016 election interference?

Why didn’t Sondland remember the offer he gave to the Ukrainians in his original testimony?

Why did he agree to testify?

-- Federal prosecutors scrutinizing Giuliani and two of his associates on Thursday will question a top executive at Ukraine’s state-owned gas company about his encounters with those associates as the pair pursued energy deals in Ukraine. Tom Hamburger and Roz Helderman report: “The executive of the Ukrainian company, Andrew Favorov, an American citizen, agreed to meet with prosecutors for the Southern District of New York who had asked to speak with him about his experiences with the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The pair worked with Giuliani to gather information about the Ukraine-related activities of [Joe and Hunter Biden]. Favorov’s attorney, Lanny Breuer, said his client ‘will voluntarily sit down with the government attorneys.’ Breuer declined to comment further.”

-- A federal judge said she intends to rule no later than the end of Monday whether former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify under subpoena before Congress. The House Judiciary Committee asked for an accelerated decision because it aims to call MGahn when likely writing articles of impeachment against Trump. Spencer Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of Washington entered an order Tuesday about her deadline intent ‘absent unforeseen circumstances’ shortly after a filing from House General Counsel Douglas N. Letter arguing last week’s opening of the hearings before the House Intelligence Committee was grounds for urgency. … William A. Burck, McGahn’s attorney, has said that McGahn will abide by the president’s instructions absent a court reversal.”

-- Republicans are running through a multitude of shifting – and, at times, contradictory – defenses and deflections as they continue to stick together against Trump's impeachment. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “While those attacks — at least 22, according to a Washington Post tally — have done little to undermine the core allegations under investigation in the House, they have been remarkably successful in one respect: keeping congressional Republicans united against impeachment as the GOP casts the probe as partisan.”

-- Democrats on the Intelligence Committee and their attorney spoke the most yesterday. Philip Bump crunched the numbers: “We took C-SPAN’s closed captioning of the hearing and segmented each exchange by who was asking questions and who was responding. In total, [Schiff] spoke for more than half an hour, including lengthy introductory and closing statements. The total time that the witnesses … spent answering Democrats’ queries was about a minute longer than Schiff’s comments and questions. The witnesses spent about 10 more minutes answering Democratic questions than Republican ones, in large part because more Democratic members asked questions.”

-- “Vindman defended himself from claims that Morrison, his boss, had expressed concerns about his judgment, reading from his latest performance evaluation in which another former top NSC official described him as ‘brilliant’ and ‘unflappable,'"" Toluse Olorunnipa reports. ""On Tuesday, Trump also sought to downplay Vindman’s role and influence. ‘I never heard of him. I don’t know any of these people,’ Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. ‘I don’t know Vindman at all. What I do know is that even he said the transcript was correct.’”

-- Vindman’s uniform spoke loud at the hearing. His humanity spoke louder, writes fashion critic Robin Givhan: “When Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman appeared before the [Intelligence Committee], his striking presence in his serviceable eyeglasses and his military uniform exuded authority, ferocity and patriotism. As one of the Democratic committee members noted admiringly, Vindman was wearing a Purple Heart on his uniform. He also had a Combat Infantry Badge pinned on the left side of his chest, indicating he’d been involved in active ground combat. For civilian viewers, it was helpful to understand the meanings of some of the insignia on his jacket. But even without the details, anyone looking at the vast collage of medals spread across his chest could understand the story they told: that Vindman is one of the many dedicated individuals who choose to stand guard so that others might sleep easily.”

-- Vindman's Army uniform became a proxy symbol, either bolstering the claims of Democrats or cited as evidence by Republicans that Vindman is using his service as a shield from criticism. Alex Horton reports: “While active-duty service members routinely wear their full uniforms to testify on Capitol Hill, security experts say the scrutiny of Vindman’s uniform has become another data point in the politicization of the space between civil society and the military. The Army’s bible for appearance standards, AR 670-1, says all personnel ‘will wear an Army uniform when on duty, unless granted an exception by the commander to wear civilian clothes.’ ‘Most reactions to it imply a choice where there is not one. Commentators are projecting their own feelings without understanding military regulations, a pretty frequent occurrence in civil-military relations,’ said Loren DeJonge Schulman, a former Obama defense official who advised national security adviser Susan E. Rice.”

-- There have been six episodes in which top Trump administration and Ukrainian officials discussed a potential quid pro quo, according to congressional testimony, public statements and documents. We’ve gathered the evidence here.

-- Commentary from The Post's opinion page:

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “Dad, my sitting here today, in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,” Vindman said in his opening statement. “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.”

Catherine Pugh delivers an address during her inauguration ceremony to become mayor of Baltimore in 2016. (Patrick Semansky/AP)

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Baltimore’s former mayor Catherine Pugh has been indicted by a federal grand jury on wire fraud and tax evasion over lucrative book deals for her self-published Healthy Holly children’s series. Ann Marimow and Peter Hermann report: “Pugh resigned in May after revelations about the deals she allegedly cut with companies connected to the city and state government, setting off another political crisis and setback for the city. Pugh, 69, was the second Baltimore mayor to leave office in the past decade while facing corruption allegations.

“The indictment accuses her of a years-long scheme dating to 2007. … Federal agents sought financial documents and other information related to almost $800,000 she allegedly was paid for the books, an enormous amount in the world of children’s literature. Pugh is expected to surrender to U.S. Marshals before a court appearance Thursday, prosecutors said. Two former Baltimore employees, Gary Brown Jr, 38, and Roslyn Wedington, 50, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and to filing false tax returns, prosecutors said in a statement.”

-- Uber plans to record audio of customers during rides in the U.S. Faiz Siddiqui scoops: “The new feature, which is first to be piloted in some Latin American cities next month, allows users to opt in to activate an audio recording on any trip or all trips, according to internal communications viewed by The Washington Post and confirmed by Uber. In markets where it’s available, users would likely be given a blanket warning that trips are subject to recording — and that the feature will be active in their market. Riders and drivers will not be able to listen back. ‘When the trip ends, the user will be asked if everything is okay and be able to report a safety incident and submit the audio recording to Uber with a few taps,’ according to an email written by an Uber executive ... ‘The encrypted audio file is sent to Uber’s customer support agents who will use it to better understand an incident and take the appropriate action.’ … The new feature raises privacy concerns over the potential to run afoul of wiretapping and eavesdropping statutes aimed at ensuring people are not recorded without their consent.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- U.S. military aid is helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression, but the drama surrounding the impeachment inquiry is making Kyiv nervous. Sergey Morgunov, Will Englund and Michael Birnbaum report: “Powerful night-vision devices remove the cover of darkness. Counterartillery radar detects and pinpoints the batteries during firing. Surveillance drones, troubled at first by Russian hacking when introduced in 2016, have since proved their worth, Col. Yevhen Bondar said. It all came from the United States, over the course of five years and part of about $4 billion in military and security assistance designed to counter the Moscow-backed separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. … The block on a nearly $400 million aid package, approved by Congress, was lifted Sept. 11, in time to beat the end of the federal fiscal year. For its part, Ukraine is spending nearly 5.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense and security this year, or about $10 billion. The Trump-ordered delay was felt in Ukraine — but not so much in terms of spot shortages of military materiel, because equipment such as this always moves in fits and starts. The real fallout has been one of perception among Ukrainian officials and others — the worry that the White House cannot always be counted on to be in Kyiv’s corner.”

-- But, but, but: $35 million in Pentagon aid still hasn’t reached Ukraine, despite White House assurances, reports the L.A. Times.

-- And Zelensky refused to confirm or deny whether he was prepared to publicly announce an investigation into Burisma after his July 25 call with Trump. CNN posted a video that shows him rolling his eyes when asked on Tuesday, before he brushed off the question. “I think everybody in Ukraine is so tired about Burisma,” he said. “We have our country. We have our independence. We have our problems and questions. That’s it.”

-- Two U.S. service members were killed overnight when their helicopter crashed in Afghanistan while supporting combat operations. Sayed Salahuddin and Susannah George report: “The military said the fatalities brought to 19 the number of U.S. combat deaths in Afghanistan this year, adding that the incident is under investigation. The Taliban said the helicopter was shot down as Afghan and U.S. forces were preparing to launch an attack in the area, according to a statement from Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman. The 19 service members killed so far this year by hostile forces, surpasses the total of 13 who died in 2018.”

-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is searching for a safe exit from his position ahead of a Senate run, three GOP sources tell Time: “Pompeo’s plan had been to remain at the State Department until early spring next year, ... but recent developments, including the House impeachment inquiry, are hurting him politically and straining his relationship with Trump. So Pompeo is rethinking his calendar, say the top Republicans, one who served in the Trump Administration, another who remains in government, and a third who served in several high-ranking posts and is active in GOP politics. The timing of Pompeo’s resignation now will be decided by his ability to navigate the smoothest possible exit from the administration, the three Republicans say.”

-- “Republicans tasked with keeping the party’s Senate majority in the U.S. Senate still see Pompeo as their best option in the open-seat race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts,"" the Kansas City Star reports: ""At a ‘Save the Senate’ event on Nov. 8 at Trump International Hotel in Washington, the National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Kevin McLaughlin told a room full of lawmakers, lobbyists, and GOP donors to call Pompeo and urge him to run ... The gathering took place just weeks after the NRSC, the party’s main campaign arm for Senate races, met with Republican Rep. Roger Marshall, the western Kansas congressman pursuing the seat. Marshall leads all current candidates in fundraising by about $1 million. ‘I think they certainly understand that we’re the frontrunner and I feel like we’re getting a lot of good support from them right now,’ Marshall said Tuesday when asked about the October meeting.”

-- Iran’s security forces may have killed more than 100 protesters as part of a brutal crackdown on demonstrations. Erin Cunningham reports: “The government has acknowledged only five deaths, including four members of the security forces, and has blamed the protests on foreign enemies and saboteurs. If confirmed, the higher death toll would signal a much wider scale of unrest — a crisis taking place under a near-total information blackout. London-based Amnesty said at least 106 demonstrators have been killed in 21 cities since protests began Friday, citing what it said was verified video footage and credible witness testimony. Security forces have used firearms, water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters, according to the report, which also cited the use of live ammunition.”

-- A small group of protesters is still inside Hong Kong's Polytechnic University after a series of mass arrests. Tiffany Liang, Anna Kam, Casey Quackenbush and Gerry Shih report: “Hong Kong’s police force said Tuesday that it had apprehended 1,100 people over the past day alone, as months of violent clashes appeared to reach something of a climax. It said many of the detainees would be charged with rioting and possession of offensive weapons. It was the largest number of arrests and injuries on a single day since the protests began five months ago. … In Hong Kong, concerns rose over the relative handful of protesters who have so far refused to leave the besieged campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, with authorities urging them to come out peacefully but refusing to rule out action to flush them out. ... In Washington, the U.S. Senate, in a unanimous vote, passed legislation Tuesday aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong ... The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act now goes to the House of Representatives, which earlier approved its own version of the measure.""

-- A former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong said he was repeatedly tortured by Chinese secret police over a two-week period over the protests. Simon Denyer, Tiffany Liang and Casey Quanckenbush report: “Simon Cheng, in an account of his treatment published on Facebook, described being handcuffed and shackled, blindfolded and hooded, deprived of sleep, made to sit absolutely still or hung in a uncomfortable spread-eagled position for hours on end, and constantly threatened during incessant interrogations. British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said his government was shocked and appalled by the ‘brutal and disgraceful treatment’ to which Cheng was subjected after being detained during a business trip to Shenzhen in mainland China in August, and said it had summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to protest. But China said its ambassador would never accept Britain’s ‘false allegations.’”

-- Trump’s troop withdrawal from Syria has allowed the Islamic State to gain strength, according to a chilling study by the Pentagon. From Politico: “The withdrawal and incursion allowed ISIS to ‘reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad,’ the quarterly report from the lead inspector general on the U.S. military campaign against ISIS stated. The report cited information from the Defense Intelligence Agency. … ‘In the longer term, ISIS will probably seek to regain control of some Syrian population centers and expand its global footprint, the DIA said,’ the inspector general added.”

-- Some Israelis are celebrating the Trump administration's decision to no longer consider their settlements in the West Bank as illegal under international law. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “At a hastily arranged meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, settler leaders gathered Tuesday at Alon Shvut, a settlement south of Jerusalem, to relish a rare international endorsement of their presence there. ‘I admit I am very moved,’ Netanyahu said at the gathering. He called the Trump administration’s latest policy shift toward Israel ‘an achievement that will stand for generations.’ For many living in Israel’s settlements, the news from Washington was a welcome relief from the drumbeat of condemnation from the international community, including a recent European requirement that products from the settlements carry special labeling. … But observers said their eagerness to do more — add settlements, expand settlements, annex parts of the West Bank — was likely to be met with disappointment, at least in the short term. Like so much else in the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the bombshell announcement was a noisy outburst not likely to make much difference on the contested ground any time soon.”

-- Counterprogramming: On Capitol Hill, a bipartisan mix of officials are showing support for Enes Kanter, the NBA star and Turkish dissident, after Trump welcomed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House last week. Jacob Bogage reports: “Kanter’s jersey from his time with the Oklahoma City Thunder hangs in the office of Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma. He talks about the NBA with Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat known throughout the Senate as a basketball devotee. He has discussed Interpol red notices with Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and joked about Boston sports fans with Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.). Then last week, Kanter, a center for the Boston Celtics, stood shoulder to shoulder with Wyden and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in the Capitol as they introduced human rights legislation aimed at Turkey. ... Kanter has used that attention and the spotlight of his NBA career to crusade for a more democratic Turkey, befriending and recruiting to the cause American lawmakers from each city he has played in during his nine-year NBA career. Few other prominent Turks have taken a stand against Erdogan in Washington.”

-- Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his challenger, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, had their first debate last night ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “The debate on ITV showcased a dozen ordinary voters allowed to ask their questions. ... Johnson promised he had a Brexit deal ready to pop into the oven, heat and serve. Corbyn said it was ‘nonsense’ to say Johnson could complete Brexit by January. He said a trade deal with the European Union would take seven years to negotiate. … Johnson said he would get Brexit done — and challenged Corbyn again on his position on Britain’s leaving the European Union. Corbyn said he would quickly negotiate a new, softer Brexit deal with the E.U. and then take it to the public in a second referendum. … Corbyn is trailing overall in a sample of recent opinion surveys and, given that he did not break through during the debate, will hope to generate more excitement Thursday with the launch of his party’s election manifesto.”

-- Years after freezing new projects, China is back to building coal power plants. Gerry Shih reports: “In the past two years, China has expanded its coal fleet by 43 gigawatts — roughly the entire coal-fired capacity of Germany, according to Global Energy Monitor, a group that tracks construction in the Chinese power industry using public announcements and satellite images. Excluding China, global coal power capacity would otherwise be dropping as countries in Europe and elsewhere decommission old facilities and switch to other energy sources, the group said in a report released Wednesday.""

-- Venice’s plan to protect itself from flooding became a disaster in itself. Chico Harlan and Stefano Pitrelli report: “It is among the most ambitious works of civil engineering in modern Italian history, an underwater fortress of steel designed to rise from the depths during high tides to protect the lagoon city of Venice. But decades after being conceived, the project remains incomplete and unusable, little more than a refuge for the clams and barnacles that have made the machinery their home. Venice, meantime, remains vulnerable, as demonstrated by the tides that inundated the city last week, flooding piazzas, churches and hotels, depositing layers of salt that eat away marble. The city’s 6 billion euro flood barrier has been under construction since 2003 and was originally supposed to take eight years. Now, the best guess is that it will be ready by 2021 or 2022. Some experts say that, given the pace of sea-level rise, it may be obsolete just decades after it starts operating. Others wonder, given its sorry history, whether the system will ever be ready. Parts of the underwater project are already corroding.”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, days after being pardoned for war crimes by Trump, has been ordered to appear before Navy leaders today, where he is expected to be notified that he'll be ousted from the Navy SEALs. From the Times: “Navy officials had planned to begin the process of taking away Chief Gallagher’s Trident pin, the symbol of his membership in the SEALs, earlier this month. But as he waited outside his commander’s office, Navy leaders sought clearance from the White House that never came, and no action was taken. Admiral [Collin] Green now has the authorization he needs from the Navy to act against Chief Gallagher, and the formal letter notifying the chief of the action has been drafted by the admiral … The Navy also plans to take the Tridents of three SEAL officers who oversaw Chief Gallagher — Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil — and their letters have been drafted as well … Removing a Trident does not entail a reduction in rank, but it effectively ends a SEAL’s career. … The move sets up a potential confrontation between Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly championed Chief Gallagher, and Admiral Green, who has said he intends to overhaul discipline and ethics in the SEAL teams and sees Chief Gallagher’s behavior as an obstacle.”

-- White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham is facing backlash after she claimed without evidence that aides to former president Barack Obama left behind disparaging messages on the day Trump was inaugurated. Toluse Olorunnipa and Josh Dawsey report: “Grisham said that White House aides left ‘Obama books' throughout the White House and taped a big ‘You will fail’ sign on the door of the press office before Trump aides moved in — claims that sparked a chorus of condemnation from former Obama administration officials. Grisham then modified her assertions later in the day, changing key parts of her story and saying she viewed the alleged conduct as little more than a harmless prank. … Grisham did not provide evidence to back up her allegations. No other administration official has made any similar allegations publicly in the 34 months since Trump entered the White House. Five former senior administration officials present on Day One in 2017 said they do not remember witnessing or hearing of any notes like the ones that Grisham described. ‘Not in my office,’ said one of the former officials.”

-- The American Medical Association called for an immediate ban on all electronic cigarettes and vaping devices. From the AP: “The AMA cited a surge in underage teen use of e-cigarettes, which typically heat a solution that contains nicotine. ‘It’s simple, we must keep nicotine products out of the hands of young people,’ Dr. Patrice Harris, AMA’s president, said in a statement. The doctors’ group said a separate health issue also prompted its action — the recent U.S. outbreak of lung illnesses linked to vaping. Most of those sickened said they vaped THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana, not nicotine. Officials believe a thickening agent used in black market THC vaping products may be a culprit.”

-- Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump's commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the administration, explained what he thinks the Trump administration should do on vaping: “E-cigs aren’t safe, but when used properly they are not nearly has harmful as lighting tobacco on fire and smoking it. Yet providing adult smokers with a safer alternative to cigarettes cannot come at the expense of addicting a generation of young people to nicotine with these same products. New data from the Food and Drug Administration shows almost a third of teens now vape. And according to a study published in February in the Journal of the American Medical Association, young people who start out using nicotine through e-cigs are more likely to become long-term smokers. The solution is to get e-cigs out of the hands of kids but preserve the devices’ potential to help adult smokers fully quit cigarettes.""

-- The House passed a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown on Friday, setting up a December showdown over Trump’s border wall that could fall in the midst of impeachment votes. Erica Werner reports: “The legislation, which passed 231 to 192, extends government funding through Dec. 20. It must pass the Senate and be signed by Trump before midnight Thursday. If not, government funding would expire, causing many agencies to begin to shutter operations and furlough staff. The Senate is expected to act on the legislation ahead of the deadline. A senior administration official said Tuesday that Trump is expected to sign the bill. …

""Ahead of the vote, lawmakers of both parties bemoaned their failure to agree on the 12 annual spending bills for 2020, and the resulting need to enact short-term measures once again. … And in an ominous sign of increased partisanship around the spending process, only 12 House Republicans voted in favor of the short-term spending bill Tuesday -- many fewer than the 76 Republicans who supported the last stop-gap bill.""

-- Former House speaker John Boehner returned to a Capitol transformed from heated partisanship into a cauldron of constitutional standoff. Paul Kane reports: “Officially there to unveil a portrait that will hang in a venerated room just off the House floor, Boehner brought with him one last bid to get his former colleagues to embrace a style that charmed friends and enemies alike. He remains an eternal optimist who views the world as a ‘glass half full’ — usually with red wine in one hand, a Camel cigarette in the other, handkerchief stuffed into his coat pocket to wipe away his ever-flowing tears. ‘It doesn’t cost anything to be nice. I’d like to think we were able to disagree without being disagreeable,’ Boehner told several hundred well-wishers inside Statuary Hall. ‘And I’d like to think that we tried to do the right things for the right reasons.’ Boehner rejected the chance to weigh in on impeachment, as he did again Tuesday in an interview with Fox Business Network, where he and one of his lobbying partners, Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), the former member of House Democratic leadership, touted a pension plan supported by their firm. ‘I’ll just observe,’ Boehner said of Trump.”

-- Customs and Border Protection issued a new edict regarding which U.S. officials are worthy of a framed portrait on the agency’s walls: Just the president. Maria Sacchetti reports: “The shrinking photo gallery is the result of an agency mandate to feature only Senate-confirmed leaders and elected officials on its walls. Because Trump has said he prefers to keep many top officials in ‘acting’ positions to make it easier to fire them, and because the president has repeatedly refused to nominate the agency’s leaders for confirmation, Trump’s photo will stand alone. … CBP issued the edict because Trump last week replaced acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan with acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf. Because McAleenan was CBP’s most recently confirmed commissioner, he appeared on the agency’s walls in that capacity, agency spokeswoman Stephanie Malin said. The agency displays only portraits of officials in ‘confirmed leadership positions.’”

-- Two jail workers were charged with falsifying records of checks on Jeffrey Epstein the night he died. Devlin Barrett reports: “A grand jury charged Tova Noel and Michael Thomas with conspiring to defraud the United States and making false records while working at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. They are accused of repeatedly signing false paperwork that they conducted regular checks Aug. 10 on Epstein and other inmates. Epstein was found hanging in his cell early that morning, and the city’s medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. For ‘substantial portions of their shifts, Noel and Thomas sat at their desk, browsed the Internet, and moved around the common area’ of the section of the jail where Epstein was held, known as the Special Housing Unit, or SHU, the grand jury charged. The indictment charges that Noel and Thomas repeatedly signed false ‘count slips’ even though they failed to conduct the required counts at midnight, 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. They also failed to check more frequently on Epstein, as had been ordered by higher-ups at the jail, according to the indictment. The document repeatedly notes that its charges are based on ‘video from the MCC’s internal video surveillance system.’”

-- The Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman who carried out the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas pleaded guilty. From NBC News: “Douglas Haig, 57, of Mesa, Arizona, admitted he made ammunition without a license. Haig came under investigation when armor-piercing bullets found inside Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them. Haig has admitted selling 720 rounds of tracer ammunition to the shooter in the weeks before the massacre that killed 58 people. Haig's guilty plea involves the illegal manufacture of armor-piercing rounds.”

-- Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) wants compassion for the Trump supporter convicted of making death threats against her. Lateshia Beachum reports: “Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., 55, of Addison, N.Y., entered the guilty plea before Chief U.S. District Judge Frank P. Geraci for threatening to assault and murder the freshman congresswoman and for being a felon in possession of firearms ... The plea stems from a March call that Carlineo made to Omar’s Washington, D.C., office. … Although he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, Omar wrote an open letter to Geraci requesting that he refrain from sentencing Carlineo to a long prison term and a large fine. Carlineo needs compassion and restorative justice that will allow him to understand the consequences of his actions and to make amends, she wrote. ... Carlineo told an FBI special agent that ‘if our forefathers were still alive, they’d put a bullet in her head' ... He told investigators that he was a President Trump-loving patriot who ‘hates radical Muslims’ in the government ... Carlineo told FBI agents that he had a shotgun and a .22 caliber firearm at his home that he claimed belonged to his girlfriend but later admitted to belonged to him...""

-- A white teen girl with a detailed plan for a racist attack on black churchgoers in her notebook was arrested in Georgia, police said. Derek Hawkins reports: “The 16-year-old girl was charged with attempt to commit murder after students at her high school told administrators she had a notebook filled with ‘detailed plans’ to kill members of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Gainesville, Ga., according to police. The alleged plot was ‘definitely racially motivated,’ said Sgt. Kevin Holbrook of the Gainesville Police Department. The notebook, he said, contained ‘manifesto-type’ language that discussed how she wanted to assault black parishioners with butcher knives and other sharp-edged weapons.""

-- An Air Force master sergeant, Cory Reeves, was demoted after being accused of spreading white nationalist propaganda, but he is allowed to continue serving. Katie Shepherd reports: “The episode highlights a growing concern about active-duty military and veterans joining the ranks of white supremacist organizations. The leaked Discord chat logs, published by the nonprofit media collective Unicorn Riot in March, led journalists and activists to expose members of the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps as members of Identity Evropa, which has been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.""

-- A white supremacist manifesto received by Syracuse University students prompted a fresh wave of concern on the campus where nearly a dozen racist incidents in the past two weeks have sparked calls for outside investigations. Kim Bellware reports: “Since Nov. 7, when racist scrawls were discovered in dormitory bathrooms and hallways, the campus of nearly 23,000 students has been shaken by at least 10 more hate-fueled episodes ... The incidents have drawn national attention and spurred sit-ins, protests and intervention from the state’s top elected officials. Freshman Dumebi Ebemor said Tuesday that university officials had not canceled classes after the distribution of the manifesto, which Syracuse police later said appears to be identical to the white supremacist manifesto shared by the gunman in the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. The racist screed was sent to students in the university’s Bird Library via the Apple file-sharing feature AirDrop.""

2020 WATCH:

-- We are co-hosting a Democratic debate tonight with MSNBC. Here’s what you need to know:

Debate coverage starts at 8 p.m. EST, and the debate will run from 9 to 11 p.m. EST.

It’s being held in Atlanta at the Tyler Perry Studios, and you can watch online on washingtonpost.com or on our apps, as well as on MSNBC.

Ten candidates qualified to be onstage, meaning this debate has two fewer candidates than last month.

-- Dave Weigel sketches out what he's watching for tonight:

What does Pete Buttigieg do under pressure? “Every other campaign has some level of contempt for the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Some have expressed it subtly, like [Elizabeth] Warren decrying ‘consultant-driven’ campaigns; some have been more direct, like former HUD secretary Julián Castro warning that Buttigieg can't excite nonwhite voters. … In the past, Buttigieg has gotten around tough questions with the help of rival candidates who didn't want to attack him.”

“Every other campaign has some level of contempt for the South Bend, Ind., mayor.

“The Massachusetts senator's slip in the polls could benefit her in one small way: It's put more pressure on Buttigieg. … Warren's campaign has readied itself for attacks on her past and has been occasionally surprised when they haven't come.” Does Bernie Sanders still treat Warren like a partner? “For the first time, Sanders and Warren do have slightly different plans: Warren would use her first budget to begin enrolling people in an expanded version of Medicare but not end duplicative private insurance until three years later. The question is whether Sanders, who is generally viewed by voters as more trustworthy than Warren, explores that question or defends the overall goal of his legislation, shared by Warren, against all comers.”

-- Biden is planning a major Iowa push after tonight's debate as concerns grow about his weaknesses in the first voting state. Matt Viser and Holly Bailey report: “Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”

-- Biden has durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class workers who see him as one of their own. From the Times: “In dozens of interviews, from parades and union rallies to black churches and political picnics, working-class Democrats who support Mr. Biden explained their views in practical terms: they know and trust the Scranton native from his long tenure as a Delaware senator and as Barack Obama’s vice president, they find his incremental policy proposals realistic and they think he can win. … Surveys in this race indicate a return to the longstanding tradition in Democratic primaries of voters splitting along class lines, and illuminate a key slice of Mr. Biden’s base. … For some voters, Mr. Biden appeals because there are strategic assumptions at work: many black working-class Democrats believe that white America will only support a well-known white male, such as Mr. Biden, while a number of working-class white Democrats also believe he is the most acceptable nominee. Some voters cited the misogyny and racism that female candidates and candidates of color have experienced in previous races.”

-- There are two Rhodes Scholars running for president, but Buttigieg gets way more credit for this than Cory Booker. From HuffPost: “HuffPost searched mentions in U.S. publications for 2019, finding that news outlets cited Buttigieg’s Rhodes scholarship 596 times. Booker had just 79 mentions.” Booker also attended Stanford and Yale Law.

-- Documents reveal that a massive “dark-money” group pumped $140 million into Democratic and left-leaning causes in 2018. From Politico: “The Sixteen Thirty Fund, a little-known nonprofit headquartered in Washington, spent $141 million on more than 100 left-leaning causes during the midterm election year, according to a new tax filing from the group. The money contributed to efforts ranging from fighting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and other Trump judicial nominees to boosting ballot measures raising the minimum wage and changing laws on voting and redistricting in numerous states. The spending was fueled by massive anonymous donations, including one gift totaling $51.7 million. That single donation was more than the group had ever raised before in an entire year before [Trump] was elected.”

-- Liberal groups, anxious over Trump’s growing lead in the money race, are committing to spend in general-election swing states during the primaries. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout. ‘We can’t wait until we have a candidate to do this work,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive of Acronym, a politically active nonprofit supporting Democrats.""

SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:

Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party on July 4 to become an independent after concluding that Trump committed impeachable offenses, said Volker and Morrison didn't help the GOP's case:

Today was really bad for Pres. Trump, especially the afternoon testimonies of Volker and Morrison—probably the worst yet for the president.

The White House's director of social media also attacked Vindman from his government account, prompting this observation from a Post colleague:

This is the equivalent of the executive editor of The Washington Post tweeting that one of his reporters can't be trusted. I can't imagine a more toxic work environment. https://t.co/ka35qAd3vS — Greg Jaffe (@GregJaffe) November 19, 2019

The president's son also attacked the Army officer:

What a joke... Can anyone watch this and believe that Vindman has any credibility?

A Politico reporter compared Volker's private deposition with his public testimony:

Big change from Volker's first testimony to his opening statement today.

Right: He says Sondland did bring up investigations, and he found it ""inappropriate"" pic.twitter.com/VNeV93wNPI — Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) November 19, 2019

One of our national security correspondents explained how Volker's story still doesn't really add up:

Volker assertion that he saw ""sharp distinction"" between Burisma and Biden is an assertion of fairly astonishing ignorance -- he never googled Burisma? Never wondered why it Trump/Giuliani so interested in one company? Missed Giuliani public statements? & on & on — Greg Miller (@gregpmiller) November 19, 2019

And a CNN correspondent observed another damning fact pattern that's now taken as a given:

still striking that while there is debate over explicit linkage of security assistance to statement of investigations into political rival, there is zero debate that same statement - targeting political rival & 2016 - was openly discussed in exchange for a White House meeting — Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) November 19, 2019

The two witnesses in the morning went back to work at the White House after their testimony:

ABC's White House correspondent shared some images from the day the Trump aides moved into their offices:

Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.

“We can’t wait until we have a candidate to do this work,” said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive of Acronym, a politically active nonprofit supporting Democrats. “There’s so much we can and need to be doing right now that is going to help strengthen the position of our candidate when we have one.”

The efforts reflect a growing anxiety about Trump’s unprecedented reelection machine, which has been raising money since he was elected president. Along with the Republican Party and pro-Trump committees, his reelection effort has raised more than $752 million — a record sum.

He has been forging ahead even as Democratic presidential hopefuls continue to focus their firepower on each other, and as the Democratic electorate remains far from decided on a candidate heading into 2020.

AD

Democrats maintain that they do not need to outraise Trump to defeat him, and that the money will flow once the party coalesces around its nominee. But they worry about Trump’s lead.

AD

“He can just build his fortress while we’re trying to sort it out,” said Sunita Leeds, a major Democratic donor. “They have a head start because they don’t have a primary.”

The Democratic National Committee is focused on preparing for its role in the general election, when it can work in lock-step with the nominee to raise and spend lots of money quickly. The DNC remains vastly outraised by its GOP counterpart but has raised more than it did by this point in the 2016 cycle.

AD

Wealthy donors are giving to an array of nonprofits and super PACs, ranging from the anti-Trump “resistance” groups that formed in 2017 to the big-money groups amplifying the liberal message, like Priorities USA Action.

“There are a number of efforts underway to try and make sure that there is infrastructure in place for the eventual nominee,” said Andy Spahn, a Los Angeles-based Democratic donor and fundraiser, and a longtime political adviser to some of the party’s biggest donors. “We need to invest millions to compete with Trump’s spending and counter the advantages of incumbency.”

AD

Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC and nonprofit effort, has launched a $100 million ad campaign largely targeting battleground-state voters. Last week, it announced plans to run Facebook and YouTube ads aimed at Latino audiences, primarily in Florida and Arizona. The nonprofit arm plans on spending another $20 million on voter-access litigation.

AD

“Our key strategic inflection point is the first and second quarter of next year,” said Guy Cecil, Priorities USA chairman. “Are we able to compete and respond and maybe even prosecute some [of Trump’s] advantages?”

Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is weighing a presidential run, said he will spend $100 million on anti-Trump digital ads in four battleground states through the primaries.

Democratic super PAC American Bridge and its nonprofit arm plan to spend $50 million on an advertising campaign aimed at narrowing Trump’s margins with white, working-class voters in swing states. Last week, it began its first round of spending, with $5 million.

AD

AD

Acronym and its affiliated super PAC, Pacronym, have pledged to spend $75 million in digital ads aimed primarily at voters in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Another group of Democratic donors plans to direct at least $25 million to about a dozen nonprofits, mainly in swing states, to help defeat Trump. And Way to Win, a coalition of liberal donors, plans to invest $50 million to help boost Democratic turnout in the South and Southwest.

“Donors are ready. They’re fired up. They’re ready to play big in 2020,” said Tory Gavito, president of Way to Win.

The efforts come as Trump continues to raise money from loyal online donors fueling his campaign by giving $25 or $50 at a time, as well as wealthy backers directing millions of dollars per fundraising event.

AD

Already, his campaign has spent more than $26 million on Facebook and Google advertising. That is more than the combined digital spending by four leading Democrats: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, according to data by Bully Pulpit Interactive.

AD

Trump’s head start has also allowed him to buy pricey ad slots as a show of force — such as running a television ad during Game Seven of the World Series, and a banner video ad on the YouTube homepage on the first day of the Democratic debate earlier this year.

“We’ve never seen spending this early and at these levels in a presidential election by an incumbent. The incumbent has always had the bully pulpit advantage, but this is different,” McGowan said.

AD

But there are differing philosophies on how to offset that advantage.

Bradley Beychok, president of American Bridge, said last week in a memo to supporters that Democratic gains with white working-class voters have been important to the party’s victories since 2016.

“With reports indicating that white working-class turnout could surge even higher in 2020, targeted persuasion efforts towards this group will be even more critical over the next year,” he wrote.

AD

Steve Phillips, a major Democratic donor and founder of Democracy in Color, a San Francisco-based organization, said he is worried that too much is being spent on digital ads in swing states. He contends that more money should be spent motivating reliable Democrats and minority communities he says were overlooked in 2016.

AD

“The whole pie is way too small compared to Trump. Then, what they’re spending on, what the slices of the pie are, are wrong,” Phillips said. “That’s the dominant reality of the progressive spending of this moment.”

Way to Win and its allied groups believe that minorities, women and younger voters — groups that helped elect Barack Obama — are key to winning back the White House.

“In 2016, there were gaps in funding for voter registration of blacks and Latinx communities, and we’re going to make sure that we fill those gaps this cycle,” Gavito said.

AD

These differences were on display at a private conference last week in Washington of Democracy Alliance, a network of donors who contribute at least $200,000 to certain liberal groups.

Hundreds of donors, party leaders and operatives gathered at the swanky Mandarin Oriental hotel for closed-door meetings on the spread of misinformation online, the need for more voter outreach and education, and Trump’s ability to excite and expand the conservative base.

“We can’t afford one iota of complacency,” Democracy Alliance president Gara LaMarche told attendees, according to remarks obtained by The Washington Post.

Donors said those discussions helped inform their investments. For example, Leeds said she wants to help rebuild the Democratic digital and data infrastructure, which she sees as a major gap with Trump.

AD

The DNC is also mobilizing. It has launched Organizing Corps 2020, a program to organize staff in eight swing states to help make sure that once there is a nominee, the party can quickly flood those states with trained staff. The party is also rebuilding its data program and voter file, and hiring staff to engage minority and rural voters in swing states.

DNC officials said they are meeting their fundraising goals. As of October, the DNC raised $65.5 million, and an affiliated committee that raises money for the national and state parties raised another $5.6 million, federal filings show.

The DNC raised $45.1 million as of October 2015, filings show.

“The DNC is one of the only entities that will be able to coordinate directly with the eventual nominee’s campaign, so we are making historic, early investments,” said David Bergstein, the DNC’s director of battleground state communications.

Democratic donors assert that the nominee will eventually have plenty of money to take on Trump, and that they are heartened by the small-dollar donor enthusiasm fueling primary candidates."

The Investigations

'THE GORDON PROBLEM': Loose cannon, wild card, unpredictable, cliffhanger.

Those were some of the words used by Republicans and Democrats to describe the key witness in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump: Gordon Sondland, who will testify on Capitol Hill this morning.

The Oregon hotelier whose political contributions led him to become Trump's ambassador to the European Union faces a big choice: whether to deny further direct contacts with Trump or to confirm details of a now infamous phone call overheard at a Kyiv restaurant directly tying the president to the effort to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into his political opponents.

The stakes are high, and higher still than other past star witnesses in high-profile congressional probes: John Dean had a plea agreement when he testified against Richard Nixon; and Oliver North and Richard Poindexter had immunity when talking about the Iran-Contra affair, report my colleagues Aaron C. Davis and Rachael Bade.

Sondland has no such agreement and what he will say this morning is anyone's guess.

“We aren't sure what his posture will be,” a Democratic lawmaker told Power Up.

“There is going to be enormous pressure on Sondland to minimize the president’s role — even as we have people under oath saying Sondland has already misrepresented his position and the extent of the contacts he had with the president,” Timothy Naftali, a history professor at New York University and co-author of the book “Impeachment,” per Aaron and Rachael.

Second chance?: Lawmakers had not-so-subtle messages for Sondland, who has already provided seven hours of closed- door testimony in which he downplayed his relationship with Trump and omitted key details other witnesses have provided.

From Democrats: “If I was Ambassador Sondland, I would take a deep breath and start over,” Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) told Aaron and Rachael. “Take into consideration everything we have learned from other witnesses. Tell us exactly what took place and his interactions with the president … It’s never too late to do the right thing.”

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) encouraged Sondland to “be truthful” in an interview with Aaron and Rachael: “It would be liberating for you to just be truthful. It’s amazing how many people rise to the occasion to do that. The fact that [Sondland] amended his testimony should be encouraging.”

From Republicans: “I expect Ambassador Sondland to tell us the same thing he said in his deposition,” House Intelligence Committee member K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.) told Aaron and Rachael. “Asked what would happen if he does not, he said: 'Well, there are legal ramifications for that, for changing your [testimony]. He’s got to have good reasons.'”

“The impeachment effort comes down to one guy, Ambassador Sondland,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who like many Republicans has argued that only a first-person account of Trump leveraging U.S. power for personal gain could give Democrats grounds to impeach. “All the other testimony has a Sondland core to it and a Sondland connection.”

said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who like many Republicans has argued that only a first-person account of Trump leveraging U.S. power for personal gain could give Democrats grounds to impeach. “All the other testimony has a Sondland core to it and a Sondland connection.” “At this particular point, we have no reason to believe that he’s going to go back against a deposition that he gave and then revised,” Meadows told reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday, per Roll Call's Lindsey McPherson. “They have to either get him to turn on the president or attack his credibility.""

And Trump allies sought to downplay Sonland's connection to the president. Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign official who now hosts a podcast with Steve Bannon, trashed the ambassador.

“Amb. Sondland is a dilettante trying to seem more important to the president than he is, be a big shot,"" Miller said on the podcast.

The facts: Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide, corroborated that Sondland and Trump were in close contact in yesterday's testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

“Among the discussions I had with Dr. [Fiona] Hill about Ambassador Sondland — I think she might have coined it the ‘Gordon problem’ — and I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing. I didn't necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested that he believed was important,” Morrison told lawmakers. “He wanted to get a meeting -- I understood that the president wanted to do and had agreed to a meeting so I was tracking that we need to schedule a meeting.”

I didn't necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested that he believed was important,” Morrison told lawmakers. “He wanted to get a meeting -- I understood that the president wanted to do and had agreed to a meeting so I was tracking that we need to schedule a meeting.” Kurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, amended his deposition to say that an investigation into Burisma was actually discussed during a July 10 meeeting at the White House with Sondland and Ukrainian officials.

Sondland did make “a generic comment about investigations,” which “all of us thought was inappropriate,” Volker told lawmakers.

The discrepancies in Sondland's closed door deposition certainly present some credibility issues — he already made a significant revision to his testimony earlier this month:

After initially testifying he had no recollection of any quid pro quo, Sondland amended his testimony to say he did actually recall telling a Ukrainian official that security assistance and an Oval Office meeting were conditioned on the investigations.

Another discrepancy: ""Witnesses have said Sondland pressured Ukrainian officials over the investigations, including at a White House meeting July 10. Sondland last month said he recalled no such exchange,"" per Rachael and Aaron.

Sondland's biggest decision will be to decide whether to confirm the account of a problematic phone call with the president that he failed to mention in previous testimony. David Holmes, a counselor in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine who will testify publicly tomorrow after giving a private account to lawmakers, overheard a July 26 phone call between Sondland and Trump at a restaurant in Kyiv.

“I then heard President Trump ask, ‘So, he’s gonna do the investigation?’ ” Holmes testified, per the transcript. “Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘he’s gonna do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will do ‘anything you ask him to.’ ”

On The Hill

Some other highlights from yesterday: Trump’s July 25 call was not so perfect, according to yesterday's witnesses.

“Three current and former Trump administration officials described Tuesday how they harbored a variety of concerns surrounding a July phone call in which President Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — boosting Democrats’ inquiry into whether Trump should be impeached and substantially undercutting the president’s assertion that the conversation was ‘perfect,’” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Mike DeBonis and Matt Zapotosky.

There was one official who did not view the call as problematic, though: Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Vice President Pence’s national security adviser, said in a rare public statement released Tuesday he had been on the call and heard “nothing wrong or improper.”

Volker defends Biden: While Volker claimed that he was not aware of a quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukrainians, he did offer an impassioned defense of Joe Biden and called the anti-Biden campaign inappropriate:

“I have known Vice President Biden for 24 years. He is an honorable man and I hold him in the highest regard,” Volker told lawmakers.

About the “conspiracy theory” peddled by Rudy Giuliani that the former veep was compromised in his duties because of his son’s involvement in Burisma: “The accusation that Vice President Biden was acting inappropriately didn’t seem at all credible to me...The allegations against Biden are self-serving and not credible.”

A tense exchange: Lt. Col Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an NSC expert on Ukrainel, spoke with a contact in the intelligence community about Trump’s July 25 phone call but refused to disclose the name of the official, per the advice of his attorney:

“When Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, began asking for more details about the person, Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) interjected and warned about any attempts to out the anonymous whistleblower who first filed a complaint related to the call,” per our colleague Aaron Blake.

What corruption?: Trump didn’t raise the issue of Ukrainian corruption on his April call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite being provided talking points on the issue for the call from the NSC staff, Vindman testified.

“Those were the recommended talking points that were cleared through the NSC staff for the president,” Vindman said.

How Vindman concluded his tear-jerker of an opening statement:

“Dad, my sitting here today, in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,” he said. “Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth.”

From the Courts

THREE COURT CASES YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING:

Trump could be deposed in Summer Zervos case: “Trump lost his latest bid Monday to delay a former 'Apprentice' contestant’s defamation suit as he faces a Jan. 31 deadline to undergo pretrial questioning in the case, which involves claims of unwanted kissing and groping,” the Associated Press's Jennifer Peltz reports.

More details: “A New York appellate judge rejected Trump’s request, meaning that [Zervos’s] case can continue, at least for now,” the AP reports. “Trump’s lawyers signaled they intend to pursue more legal avenues to try to hold off [Zervos’s] case … Zervos, a California restaurateur, appeared on 'The Apprentice' when Trump hosted the show in 2006. She alleges the then-businessman subjected her to unwelcome advances when she sought career advice in 2007.”

McGahn subpoena case will be ruled on by Monday: “The House Judiciary Committee is planning to hold hearings on impeaching [Trump] that expand past the Ukraine investigation and wants former White House counsel Don McGahn to be forced to testify, according to a new court filing,” CNN's Katelyn Polantz reports.

On the quick timeline: The Judiciary panel “asked a federal judge to make a ruling quickly on whether McGahn must testify in the House impeachment inquiry, citing a 'finite window of time' when he's needed,” CNN reports. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, an Obama appointee, said she will issue a ruling by Monday.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, an Obama appointee, said she will issue a ruling by Monday. Remember: House Democrats have viewed the McGahn suit as the best avenue to resolve the questions over whether congressional subpoenas carry more weight than the White House refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. A favorable ruling could convince Charles Kupperman, a former top national security aide, and possibly former national security adviser John Bolton to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry.

ICYMI: The Supreme Court delays fight over Trump's taxes: “The Supreme Court on Monday gave itself a little more time to decide whether a House committee gets to see [Trump’s] financial records,” our colleague Bob Barnes reports.

The House itself had OKed holding off on obtaining the returns: “Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. put on hold 'until further order' a lower court’s ruling that said the accounting firm Mazars USA must turn over eight years of personal and business financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee,” our colleague writes. “The House itself had acquiesced to such a move earlier … Without the court’s intervention, the firm would have been required to turn over the records Wednesday.”

The Campaign

IT'S DEBATE NIGHT: The fifth Democratic presidential debate is tonight and will be co-hosted by MSNBC and The Post.

How to watch: Coverage starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and the debate will run from 9 to 11 p.m. The Demoratic face-off will air on MSNBC and will be streamed on msnbc.com and The Post’s digital platforms, including washingtonpost.com.

The state of the race: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at [tonight's] debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. And that makes the debate a serious threat for him,” Politico's Elena Schneider reports.

Who are Buttigieg's rivals?: "" … It's hard to define who those rivals are,” our colleague Dave Weigel wrote in The Trailer last night. “Every other campaign has some level of contempt for the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Some have expressed it subtly, like Warren decrying 'consultant-driven' campaigns; some have been more direct, like former HUD secretary Julián Castro warning that Buttigieg can't excite nonwhite voters.”

Georgia on their minds: "" … While Democrats see themselves as poised to take over the state, they are a long way from building the kind of coordinated effort that Georgia Republicans — and Democrats in places like Virginia and elsewhere — have long enjoyed. Turning the historically red state blue, it turns out, is harder to pull off than to predict,” our colleague Jenna Johnson writes of efforts to make the Peach State competitive in 2020.

Stacey Abrams weighs in: “Any clear-eyed review of the numbers makes clear that Georgia is on the precipice of political change. Where Virginia sat a few cycles ago, Georgia sits today,” Abrams writes in an op-ed for The Post. 'Why is that? Here in Georgia, our rapidly diversifying population includes the youngest and most heavily African American population of any battleground state. Political participation among voters is increasing here. Among newcomers to the state, who are many, Democrats outperform Republicans by a 30-point margin. Multiple state polls have shown [Trump’s] approval underwater in Georgia.”

Biden facing troubles in Iowa: As Dave writes, the former vice president needs a solid debate performance. But he also has some serious ground to make up in the home stretch to the first-in-the-nation caucuses, a state that has doomed him before, our colleagues Matt Viser and Holly Bailey report.

Key stats: Biden promised to visit all of Iowa's 99 counties, a commitment known as the “full Grassley,"" named after the state's senior senator. “Nearly seven months later, he has visited only about a quarter of those counties,” our colleagues write. “He has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals.”

President Grover Cleveland during his first term in 1888. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1893, shortly after his second inaugural.

In the Media

WAYBACK WEDNESDAY: ""This was the plan: The president would take a friend’s yacht from New York to his summer home in Cape Cod. While at sea, a team of doctors would perform a major surgery through the roof of the president’s mouth. And there was an important directive: No matter what, the doctors could not touch the president’s trademark mustache,"" our colleague Gillian Brockell reports.

Trump's previously unscheduled trip to Walter Reed raised eyebrows: But the fears the president had some sort of procedure or operation aren't as far-fetched as you might think. White Houses have previously obscured and in some cases outright lied about a commander-in-chief's health and the story of President Grover Cleveland's secret 1893 operation to remove a cancerous growth in his mouth might be the biggest cover-up of them all.

The details: ""At the time, the U.S. economy was declining and heading toward a depression. Cleveland feared — quite rightly, Algeo wrote — that if news of his diagnosis became public, the economic situation would get even worse,"" our colleague quotes of Matthew Alego's book on the entire episode.

A different kind of yacht club: ""The surgery was performed aboard the yacht Oneida on July 1, 1893. A team of six surgeons took only 90 minutes to extract the tumor, five teeth and large section of Cleveland’s left jawbone — all through the roof of his mouth,"" our colleague writes.

An undated photo of the yacht Oneida, which later became the USS Adelante, taken some time before World War I.

A gigantic scoop changed everything: “Then, on Aug. 29, the Philadelphia Press published what Algeo calls 'one of the greatest scoops in the history of American journalism.' The president, the newspaper reported, had had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor aboard his friend’s yacht. The reporter, E.J. Edwards, knew everything, right down to the names of each doctor on board,"" our colleague writes.

The response? Lie.: The initial reporting spread the same panic the White House wanted to prevent. So, “Cleveland’s associates kicked into high gear,"" our colleague write. “The lead doctor, Cabinet officials and a presidential aide all released statements saying the story was untrue. A newspaper editor who was close friends with Cleveland said the problem had been nothing more than a toothache.""

His 'dispatch was substantially correct, even in most of the details,' the surgeon said.""

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: David Holmes, the political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, testified that he “vividly” remembers his July 26 lunch at a restaurant in Kyiv because he’d “never seen anything like this.”

After ordering a bottle of wine, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland used his unsecured cellphone to update President Trump on his meeting that morning with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Holmes said he could hear Trump say, “So he’s going to do the investigation?” And he said Sondland responded, “Oh yeah, he’s going to do it.” The ambassador explained to the president that Zelensky, whom Trump spoke with the day before, “loves your a--,” according to the transcript of Holmes’s deposition released last night by House impeachment investigators.

But it’s what purportedly transpired after this two-minute conservation that’s most problematic for both Sondland and Trump. According to Holmes, the E.U. ambassador volunteered that the president cared more about the investigation of Joe Biden that Rudy Giuliani was pursuing than anything having to do directly with Ukraine.

Holmes explained that he asked Sondland, point blank, whether it was true that the president “doesn’t give a s--- about Ukraine” because “it had been very difficult for us to get the president interested in what we were trying to do in Ukraine.”

“Ambassador Sondland agreed that the president did not give a s--- about Ukraine,” Holmes said under oath. “I asked why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated, the President only cares about ‘big stuff.’ I noted that there was ‘big stuff’ going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. And Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant ‘big stuff that benefits the president,’ like the ‘Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.’”

-- Holmes, a career Foreign Service officer, has agreed to testify publicly on Thursday at 9 a.m. alongside Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council official who also provided damaging closed-door testimony against Sondland. The 213-page transcript suggests that Holmes is poised to offer a gripping narrative for the benefit of a television audience.

“This was an extremely distinctive experience in my Foreign Service career,” Holmes said. “I’ve never seen anything like this, someone calling the President from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language. There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly.”

-- House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) questioned Holmes about his bluntness with Sondland. “I’m not proud of my language,” the diplomat answered. “But the informal tone of the lunch and the language I had heard him using in his call with the president, we were just sort of, you know, two guys talking about stuff, and it seemed to me that was the kind of language that he used.” Holmes recalled that Sondland’s exact words were: “Nope, not at all, doesn’t give a s--- about Ukraine.”

Waiters were coming and going as all this played out on the outdoor terrace at SHO, a central Kyiv restaurant. Holmes said he was surprised a presidential conversation so candid would take place on a cellphone since the Russians own or hold significant stakes in the mobile networks and government officials should always assume that they’re being monitored. Acting ambassador Bill Taylor revealed the July 26 call between Trump and Sondland during his testimony last week.

-- Holmes’s sworn testimony links Trump himself much more directly to the efforts to coerce Ukraine to investigate Biden at a time when the former vice president was leading in polls. It also further undermines another favorite GOP talking point: that Trump put assistance on ice because he was sincerely concerned about corruption and the rule of law in Kyiv. The rough transcript of Trump’s initial April call with Zelensky, released Friday, revealed that the president didn’t even broach corruption during that conversation, despite the White House’s readout from the time that said he had raised the issue. “I think the Ukrainians gradually came to understand that they were being asked to do something in exchange for the meeting and the security assistance hold being lifted,” Holmes testified.

Not to mention, the president’s reported disregard for Ukraine’s future is a boon for the Kremlin’s propaganda efforts in Russia’s ongoing invasion in the east and its occupation of Crimea.

-- It stands to reason that Sondland would know about Trump’s interest in Biden. The rough transcript of the July 25 call shows Trump mentioning his political challenger to Zelensky. But Sondland insisted under oath that he didn’t know the president was interested in securing a Biden investigation until later. “Sondland did not disclose any conversation with Trump while in Kyiv in his testimony or in the follow-up statement,” Glenn Kessler notes. “In his initial deposition, he said: ‘Again, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son. Nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.’

“Sondland in his testimony indicated that he did not understand until late in the game that administration requests that Ukraine investigate the Ukrainian gas company Burisma – where Hunter Biden was a director – were related to the Biden family. He expressed ignorance about statements and tweets made by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, making that connection. ‘I became aware of his [Giuliani’s] interest in Burisma sometime in the intervening period, but I never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens until the very end,’ Sondland said. ‘I heard the word ‘Burisma,’ but I didn't understand that Biden and Burisma were connected.’”

-- Tomorrow morning, Sondland will get a chance to clear up these and other discrepancies during his own televised testimony. Holmes’s deposition gives him more to answer for when he’s in the hot seat. The Portland, Ore., hotelier already significantly revised his testimony regarding the existence of a quid pro quo after other officials gave conflicting accounts of his role.

-- Trump claimed last week that he doesn’t have any recollection of the July 26 conversation, and the White House refuses to turn over call logs that could illuminate the extent of the president’s Ukrainian-related contacts. The president has begun distancing himself from Sondland. “I hardly know the gentleman,” Trump said on Nov. 8. The president has previously taken this tack with Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and others who he apparently concluded had outlived their usefulness to him.

-- Sondland previously sought to minimize his contacts with Trump. “I think I’ve spoken with President Trump – and this is a guess – maybe five or six times since I’ve been an ambassador,” he said during his deposition. “And one of those I recall was a Christmas, ‘Merry Christmas,’ and it was zero substance.”

But former National Security Council senior director Tim Morrison said it was his understanding that Sondland had a lot of conversations with the president. “Ambassador Sondland believed and at least related to me that the president was giving him instructions,” Morrison testified, adding that Sondland related to him that he was “discussing these matters with the president.”

-- Democrats also released the transcript last night from Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale’s appearance. Hale, the top career official at Foggy Bottom, revealed that Mike Pompeo spoke with Giuliani by phone on March 28 and March 29 as officials in the department tried to get a statement of support for then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as the president’s personal lawyer participated in a smear campaign against her. Hale said Yovanovitch was doing an “exceptional” job.

-- Pompeo continues to defy a subpoena and refuses to turn over records that could validate – or undercut – some of the most damning witness testimony about Trump’s conduct. Sondland turned over communications from his personal devices to the State Department, but State won’t share them with investigators.

-- Holmes also testified that aides to Energy Secretary Rick Perry were “very aggressive in terms of promoting an agenda” in Ukraine, as well as in “excluding embassy personnel from meetings without giving explanations.”

-- He will return to the Capitol on Thursday with a deep reservoir of credibility because he has a proven track record of speaking truth to power. “Holmes won an award in 2014 for raising concerns about then-President Barack Obama’s policy toward Afghanistan, where Holmes had served,” Anne Gearan reports. “The ‘constructive dissent’ honor recognizes mid-level State Department officials who use an internal process to flag problems they observe, which in his case was about how Obama had, in his view, muddied decision-making on Afghanistan and Pakistan. … A rising star in the Foreign Service, Holmes had a string of sought-after jobs before landing as the senior political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. In addition to the National Security Council — a high-stress, high-profile plum — Holmes also was picked for a prestigious job working for the State Department’s No. 3 official during the Obama administration.""

-- Two more-junior staffers who were sitting at the table might also be able to corroborate Holmes’s testimony if Sondland disputes his allegations: Suriya Jayanti arranged Sondland’s schedule in Kyiv, and Tara Maher, a political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, where Sondland is based.

-- Holmes said he also told others in the embassy: The encounter was so “extraordinary” that Holmes immediately told his direct supervisor at the embassy. “You’re not going to believe what I just heard,” he recalled telling her. “I would refer back to it repeatedly in our morning staff meetings,” he added. “We'd talk about what we’re trying to do. … And I would say, 'Well, as we know, he doesn't really care about Ukraine. He cares about some other things.’”

-- House investigators have now released all but two deposition transcripts. Mark Sandy from the Office of Management and Budget testified on Saturday and hasn’t come back to the Capitol to approve the text. Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, has not completed a review of his transcript either.

HAPPENING TODAY:

-- Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, European affairs director at the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe and Russia, are testifying this morning. They are the first public witnesses who heard Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky. This afternoon, lawmakers will hear from Kurt Volker, a former Trump administration envoy to Ukraine, and Morrison, the former top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council.

-- Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, plans to testify about his alarm at Trump’s request that Ukraine investigate his political opponents. “But Republicans are also seizing on Vindman’s testimony as an opportunity, signaling that they plan to try to discredit one of the key witnesses in the inquiry by questioning his motives and his loyalty to the president,” Tom Hamburger, Carol Leonnig and Rachael Bade report. “Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) suggested in a letter released Monday that Vindman fits the profile of ‘a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch [who] have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and … react by leaking to the press and participating in the ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, remove him from office.’ Vindman’s lawyer, Michael Volkov, called Johnson’s assertion ‘such a baseless accusation, so ridiculous on its face, that it doesn’t even warrant a response.’”

-- “Trump and many of his allies have seized on a core defense strategy by attacking career public servants who are testifying as witnesses in the probe and spreading disinformation about their motives as ‘unelected bureaucrats,’” Elise Viebeck and Isaac Stanley-Becker report.

-- Vindman is the second of three immigrants scheduled to testify. (My Big Idea from Friday explains the significance.)

-- Volker will modify his testimony and plans to say this afternoon that he didn’t know the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations. From the Times: “Mr. Volker will say that he did not realize that others working for Mr. Trump were tying American security aid to a commitment to investigate Democrats. His testimony, summarized by a person informed about it who insisted on anonymity to describe it in advance, will seek to reconcile his previous closed-door description of events with conflicting versions offered subsequently by other witnesses. … Mr. Volker will modify his account as well, addressing disparities between his testimony and that of other witnesses. While he has been lumped together with Mr. Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry as ‘the three amigos’ working on behalf of the president, he plans to try to distinguish his role, insisting that he was not part of any inappropriate pressure and that he was unaware of certain events that he has only now learned about through other testimony. ...

""Mr. Volker plans to say that he never knew that Mr. Sondland told the Ukrainians that the aid and investigations were linked and that he did not know that Mr. Zelensky was being pressed to appear on CNN and announce that he would open the investigations Mr. Trump sought. He also will seek to explain why his description of a key July 10 meeting in the White House with Ukrainian officials differed from those provided by several others. According to other witnesses, John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, abruptly ended the meeting when Mr. Sondland raised the investigations.”

-- State Department officials were informed that Zelensky was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate Biden even before the July phone call, the AP reports: “In early May, officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were told Zelenskiy was seeking advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in ... He was concerned [Trump] and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race ... State Department officials in Kyiv and Washington were briefed on Zelenskiy’s concerns at least three times ... Notes summarizing his worries were circulated within the department ... The briefings and the notes show that U.S. officials knew early that Zelenskiy was feeling pressure to investigate Biden, even though the Ukrainian leader later denied it in a joint news conference with Trump in September.”

MORE ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Two senators are looking into a second whistleblower’s allegations that at least one political appointee at the Treasury Department tried to interfere with an audit of Trump or Vice President Pence. Jeff Stein and Tom Hamburger scoop: “Staff members for Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Wyden (Ore.), the chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, met with the IRS whistleblower earlier this month ... Follow-up interviews are expected to further explore the whistleblower’s allegations. It could not be learned to what extent the senators consider the whistleblower a credible source. Trump administration officials have previously played down the complaint’s significance and suggested that it is politically motivated. The whistleblower, a career IRS official, initially filed a complaint in July, reporting that he was told that at least one Treasury political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president’s or vice president’s tax returns.

""In recent weeks, the whistleblower filed additional documentation related to the original complaint, which was given to congressional officials in July ... The IRS whistleblower complaint was first disclosed in an August court filing by Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. … Neal made the disclosure in court filings as part of his battle with the Trump administration over the president’s tax returns, which the Treasury Department has refused to furnish. … The Treasury inspector general has opened a review of the Treasury Department’s handling of House Democrats’ request for Trump’s tax returns. Asked whether that review would look at the IRS whistleblower’s complaint, Rich Delmar, the acting inspector general, said in an email that ‘the inquiry is ongoing, and will take into account that aspects of the underlying matter are the subject of litigation.’""

-- The impeachment inquiry is expanding to explore whether Trump lied to former special counsel Bob Mueller, the House's general counsel told a federal appeals court. Ann E. Marimow, Spencer S. Hsu and Rachael Bade report: “The statement came during arguments over Congress’s demand for the urgent release of secret grand jury evidence from Mueller’s probe of Russia’s 2016 election interference, with House lawyers detailing fresh concerns about Trump’s truthfulness that could become part of the impeachment inquiry. The hearing followed Friday’s conviction of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone for lying to Congress. Testimony and evidence at his trial appeared to cast doubt on Trump’s written answers to Mueller’s questions … ‘Did the president lie? Was the president not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?’ General Counsel Douglas N. Letter said in court. ‘The House is now trying to determine whether the current president should remain in office,’ Letter added. ‘This is something that is unbelievably serious and it’s happening right now, very fast.’ … Behind the scenes, there’s been debate among Democratic lawmakers about whether articles of impeachment should include obstruction of justice allegations detailed in Mueller’s report.”

-- Mitch McConnell said he still “can’t imagine a scenario” that would lead to Trump’s conviction in the Senate. “I can’t imagine a scenario under which President Trump would be removed from office with 67 votes in the Senate,” the Senate majority leader said, according the Louisville Courier-Journal.

-- The Supreme Court placed a temporary hold on a lower court’s ruling that said accounting firm Mazars USA must turn over eight years of Trump’s financial records. Robert Barnes reports: “The House itself had acquiesced to such a move earlier Monday. Without the court’s intervention, the firm would have been required to turn over the records Wednesday. Trump last week asked the high court to stop the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. … House General Counsel Douglas N. Letter said in a letter to the court Monday morning that the committee will oppose Trump’s motion. But ‘out of courtesy to this court,’ Letter said the committee did not oppose putting the D.C. Circuit’s ruling on hold temporarily. Roberts said in his short order that the House’s opposition to Trump’s filing should be filed by Thursday.”

-- Another federal judge blocked the House from obtaining Trump’s New York state tax returns without a court review. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols of Washington entered the unusual order in a potentially precedent-setting case, which came even though the House committee has not said whether it wants the records and has sought to toss out Trump’s lawsuit, filed last July. Nichols’s 19-page decision and order came one week after the judge dismissed New York state officials from the lawsuit, which sought to bar the House from requesting and state officials from turning over Trump’s returns using New York’s Trust Act, signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) and enacted July 7. … New York tax officials had agreed not to turn over Trump’s records any sooner than seven days after Nichols ruled on whether the Trump lawsuit should be heard before him or before a federal judge in New York.”

-- Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham announced that he will hold a hearing on Dec. 11 featuring Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. From Politico: “Horowitz's scheduled appearance before the committee comes as the inspector general is wrapping up an investigation into the origins of the FBI probe into the 2016 Trump campaign's dealings with Russia. … In a statement announcing the hearing, Graham described Horowitz as ‘a good man that has served our national well.’ … The South Carolina Republican added that Horowitz ‘will deliver a detailed report of what he found regarding his investigation, along with recommendations as to how to make our judicial and investigative systems better.’”

-- Nepotism alert: What does Rudy Giuliani’s son Andrew actually do in the White House all day? The Atlantic's Elaina Plott tried to figure it out: “The younger Giuliani has served in the Office of Public Liaison, beginning as an associate director, since March 2017, making him one of the longest-serving members of the Trump administration. According to White House personnel records from 2018, he earns a salary of $90,700. The public-liaison office deals with outreach to outside coalitions, and several of the current and former administration officials I spoke to for this story said Giuliani helps arrange sports teams’ visits to the White House. ... But sports-team visits are more special-occasion than scheduling staple in the business of government, especially in this White House, where many title-winning teams decline invitations to visit or are simply not invited at all. … Steve Munisteri, who was principal director of the public-liaison office and Giuliani’s supervisor from February 2017 to February 2019, told me that Giuliani fills out his time by serving as the office’s representative at White House meetings about the opioid crisis.

""Others who have worked with Giuliani offered a different take on his White House tenure. ‘He doesn’t really try to be involved in anything,’ one former senior White House official told me ... ‘He’s just having a nice time.’ Yet for the differing opinions on the nature of Giuliani’s role, the officials I spoke to were certain that Giuliani had nabbed a White House post in the first place because of his father. A second former senior White House official plainly called it ‘a nepotism job.’”

-- Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson said it’s “wrong” to ask another country for personal favors. “If you’re seeking some kind of personal gain and you’re using — whether it’s American foreign aid or American weapons or American influence — that’s wrong. And I think everyone understands that,” he told PBS NewsHour. (Well, not everyone.)

-- Jimmy Finkelstein, the owner of the Hill newspaper, has stayed out of the impeachment headlines, despite playing a crucial role in the saga. From CNN: “Finkelstein was [John] Solomon's direct supervisor at The Hill and created the conditions which permitted Solomon to publish his conspiratorial stories without the traditional oversight implemented at news outlets. And he has kept a watchful eye on the newspaper's coverage to ensure it is not too critical of the President. As one former veteran employee of The Hill told CNN Business, ‘Solomon is a symptom of the larger problem of Jimmy Finkelstein.’ … The paper's editor-in-chief sent staff a note Monday morning notifying employees that editors ‘are reviewing, updating, annotating with any denials of witnesses, and when appropriate, correcting any [of Solomon's] pieces referenced during the ongoing congressional inquiry.’ … Finkelstein has been friends with Trump for decades. In fact, according to a former employee at The Hill, he ‘boasts that he's a close friend’ of the President.""

-- Rep. Devin Nunes’s attorney is representing one of the congressman’s former aides in a new defamation lawsuit against Politico. McClatchy reports: “Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel, a lawyer who worked for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee when Nunes was the committee’s chairman, is suing Politico over an Oct. 23 story with the headline ‘Nunes Protege Fed Ukraine Info to Trump.’ … Patel is represented by Virginia attorney Steven Biss, who has filed five lawsuits on behalf of Nunes this year alleging that news organizations, Twitter, anonymous social media users and political consultants conspired against the California congressman. … The news story at the center of Patel’s lawsuit reported that Patel tried to involve himself in the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy. Patel now works [on] the National Security Council. The story by Politico reporter Natasha Bertrand was based on sources who described diplomats’ testimony at closed-door House Intelligence Committee hearings…”

Politico spokesman Brad Dayspring calls the suit baseless: “This lawsuit is high on bombast and low on merit. It is unserious and is a public relations tactic designed to intimidate journalists and media organizations from doing their job,” he said in a statement.

-- Tribalism alert: A remarkable 2 in 3 Americans say that nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR-PBS-Marist poll. “It's a tangible example of just how locked in most Americans are in their partisan positions, even as nearly a dozen people have either testified or are set to testify in the impeachment inquiry. The poll was conducted Nov. 11-15 — before, during and after the testimonies of the first three witnesses to be called in the inquiry. … By a 47%-41% margin, Americans say they are more likely to support impeachment based on what they've heard or read from the testimonies and evidence presented. And the testimonies could actually be serving to harden their views — 86% of Democrats said they are now more likely to support impeachment after hearing testimony and evidence while 83% of Republicans said they are less likely to now support impeachment. … Some 70% of registered voters say they've been paying ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ close attention to the House impeachment inquiry. And 53% of those paying at least fairly close attention say they're more likely to support impeachment.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Mike Pompeo declared that Israel’s West Bank settlements do not violate international law. Karen DeYoung, Steve Hendrix and John Hudson report: ""The move upends more than 40 years of U.S. policy that has declared Israeli expansion into territories occupied since the 1967 war a major obstacle to settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In response to a question, Pompeo denied that the announcement was connected to turmoil in Israel in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has supported the Israeli annexation of West Bank territory, is fighting for his political life. … Pompeo said the administration was returning to policy under Ronald Reagan, pointing out that Reagan said in a 1981 interview that settlements were ‘not illegal.’ Reagan went on in that interview, however, to say that settlements were ‘ill-advised.’” Pompeo said the Trump administration, as it did with recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and Israel’s sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights, has simply ""recognized the reality on the ground.""

-- A bid by Netanyahu’s rival to form a new Israeli government has entered its final, fraught stretch. Ruth Eglash reports: Benny Gantz's options are limited. ""The most obvious choice — uniting with [Netanyahu’s] ruling Likud party — appears increasingly unlikely, while forming a government dependent on smaller parties with sharply conflicting ideologies seems an almost impossible gamble. Gantz has until midnight Wednesday to announce a government, then secure enough support in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, to approve the new configuration. If not, Israel will enter politically uncharted territory, with even the keenest of political observers saying they have no idea what might happen next — though most are betting it will set Israel on the path to a third national election in less than a year.”

-- An American and an Australian who were being held hostage for the past three years were released by the Taliban. That announcement came shortly after it was revealed that three detained Taliban commanders had been flown to Qatar. Sayed Salahuddin and Sharif Hassan report: ""American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks were instructors at the American University of Kabul when they were kidnapped in 2016. The militants are Mali Khan, Hafiz Rashid and Anas Haqqani, a younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy leader and son of the Haqqani network’s founder. They were held in a government detention center at Bagram air base. The Haqqani network is an insurgent group closely allied with the Taliban. It is accused of orchestrating many of the sophisticated and deadly attacks against Afghan and foreign installations in recent years.”

-- Swedish prosecutors announced that the alleged rape investigation involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been dropped. Karla Adam reports: “Eva-Marie Persson, the deputy director of public prosecution, said in a statement that ‘my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.’ In 2010, Assange was accused of committing sexual offences in Sweden. A case involving an alleged rape was abandoned in 2017, but then reopened earlier this year after Assange was evicted from the Ecuador Embassy in London. Assange is currently serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for jumping bail in 2012 and is fighting extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents.”

-- As violence spikes, some Hong Kong activists see salvation in their British citizenship. Rick Noack reports: “As the Hong Kong leadership — backed by Beijing — is increasingly cracking down on pro-democracy protests in the semiautonomous territory, some argue that the West’s most credible leverage over the Chinese leadership there hinges on the British National Overseas (BNO) passport category. Issued to those who were residents of Hong Kong before the transfer of power in 1997, the passports entitle holders to some but not all rights that British citizens can rely on. Passport holders can, for instance, travel to Britain for up to six months without a visa or seek consular assistance abroad, but they are not entitled to stay in the U.K. indefinitely. Calls on the U.K. government to grant BNO passport holders full British citizenship are gradually mounting, however, amid concerns that China may be breaking its promise to maintain Hong Kong’s semiautonomous status for at least three more decades.”

-- China slammed Hong Kong judges after they ruled that demonstrators could wear face masks. Gerry Shih, Tiffany Liang and David Crawshaw report: “The central government’s Hong Kong affairs office said that Monday’s judgment ‘blatantly challenged the authority’ of China’s legislature and of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and created ‘severe negative social and political impact.’ … The comments poured fuel on one of the central grievances of Hong Kong’s protest movement — encroachment by the mainland government on the semiautonomous territory’s affairs — and could exacerbate clashes after days of violent standoffs on university campuses. But they reflect the Chinese government’s diminishing patience for the unrest, as evidenced by an increasingly harsh line from officials and state media, some of which have urged police to use live ammunition against protesters.”

-- About 100 protestors remain holed up at a university surrounded by police in Hong Kong. From the Guardian: “Lam ... said about 600 protesters surrendered to authorities at the Polytechnic University campus in Kowloon overnight, after police allowed two representatives to mediate between the two sides. About 20 activists were evacuated to seek medical help. In her first public remarks since the crisis began more than 36 hours ago, Lam said that 200 of those who surrendered were children and were not arrested. She said however that authorities reserved the right to make further investigations in the future. Lam said the other 400 who left the campus have been arrested. … Groups of protesters have tried to escape the tight police cordon around the campus. Late on Monday, dozens were seen abseiling down a footbridge as police fired tear gas, to drivers on motorbikes who whisked them away. Others tried to flee through manhole covers. … Police said they had allowed Red Cross volunteers into the university to ferry out injured protesters but said the rest had no option but to give themselves up.”

-- American federal agencies have failed to adequately respond to the threat of Chinese government-funded programs that have recruited scientists and exploited U.S. research to strengthen China’s own economy and military. From the Wall Street Journal: “With what are known as ‘talent programs,’ the Chinese government provides compensation and resources to researchers who at times illicitly transfer intellectual property to China, in some cases setting up shadow labs overseas mirroring their U.S. research, according to the report released Monday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Participants are routinely told to conceal their participation from U.S. authorities, the report said. … The Chinese government has concentrated recruitment efforts on those born in China but working in the U.S., although it also has recruited some people who are not ethnic Chinese. The report included examples of U.S.-funded scientists who allegedly willfully failed to disclose their participation in China’s Thousand Talents Plan, the best-known of more than 200 similar Chinese programs, or engaged in other activities counter to U.S. research values, the report said.”

-- North Korean veteran diplomat and Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan said the country is no longer interested in holding talks with the U.S., saying it does not want to “gift the U.S. president with something he can brag about.” Anne Gearan reports: “Trump has been hoping for a third summit with North Korea, ideally within about three months, to show that his bold effort to befriend and persuade Kim is working. … Talks have been bogged down for months, with North Korea demanding relief from economic sanctions before any meaningful discussion of disarmament. The Trump administration has stuck to its dual approach, retaining sanctions while offering free-flowing, direct leader-to-leader talks that traditional diplomacy would reserve for the very end of a process. Kim Kye Gwan’s statement to the Korean-language website of the official Korean Central News Agency [said] … that despite the two leaders’ previous meetings, ‘there has not been much improvement in relations with the United States.’”

-- The U.S. broke off talks with South Korea over how to share the cost of the two nations’ military alliance. Min Joo Kim reports: “Trump has demanded South Korea raise fivefold its contribution to cover the cost of stationing 28,500 U.S. troops in the country, asking for nearly $5 billion, officials on both sides said. But that demand has triggered anger from Korean lawmakers and sparked concerns that Trump may decide to reduce the U.S. troop presence in the Korean Peninsula if talks break down. The top U.S. negotiator, James DeHart, said the U.S. side decided to cut short the negotiations on Tuesday morning, the second of two days of planned talks. In a rare public show of disunity between the allies, he blamed South Korea for making proposals that ‘were not responsive to our request for fair and equitable burden sharing.’ … Trump insists that South Korea, as a ‘very wealthy nation,’ needs to pay more. His demand for up to $5 billion would imply South Korea was effectively not only being asked to cover local costs but also the entire wage bill for the U.S. troops.”

-- Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswomen who claims she once had a “very special relationship” with Boris Johnson, said the U.K. prime minister has fed her “to the wolves” while ghosting her. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “British authorities are looking into accusations that she received undue advantages because of her association with Johnson, including grants and contracts and participation in three trade missions abroad as part of Johnson’s entourage. … Whether there are grounds for a criminal investigation won’t be announced until after Britain’s Dec. 12 election. And whether Arcuri’s accusations of bad behavior can hurt Johnson and his Conservative Party at the polls is unclear. … Johnson, 55, is separated from his wife and living with his partner, Carrie Symonds, 31, at the prime minister’s official residence at 10 Downing Street. This arrangement, a first in British history, is barely commented on in the news media. … He remains Britain’s most popular politician.”

-- As she named herself Bolivia’s interim leader, Jeanine Áñez said her “only objective” would be to call for new elections. Yet in the week since she assumed power, the conservative leader has acted like anything but a caretaker as she undoes 14 years of socialist rule under former president Evo Morales. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “In just seven days, the U.S.-backed leader has replaced Bolivia’s top military brass, cabinet ministers and the heads of major state-owned companies with appointees of her own. Her administration has threatened to arrest ‘seditious’ lawmakers, and ejected allies of the old government including Venezuelan diplomats and Cuban doctors. Her new foreign minister announced Bolivia’s exit from the Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, a union of socialist nations based in Caracas. As supporters of Morales took to the streets last week to object, Áñez issued a presidential decree granting security forces immunity from prosecution for ‘participating in operations to reestablish internal order.’ Within hours, a confrontation between soldiers and Morales supporters near Cochabamba left nine dead.”

-- Libya’s U.N.-backed government believes that two Russians arrested on spying allegations earlier this year were employed by the Kremlin-friendly Wagner Group, a security firm. Missy Ryan and Sudarsan Raghavan report: “Fathi Bashagha, who serves as interior minister for the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), said the Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of attempting to influence planned municipal elections and gather information on the GNA’s military operations against a rival force, which is based in eastern Libya and backed by Russia. Speaking in an interview during a visit to Washington, Bashagha said the men had provided ‘confessions’ and remained in detention while the GNA attorney general investigates their activities. The alleged intelligence operation coincides with mounting concern about Russian involvement in a battle for control of Tripoli and the larger schism in the country that has impaired the oil industry and provided a foothold to Islamist militant groups.”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Trump’s health is under scrutiny again after an unplanned visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. Toluse Olorunnipa and Amy Gardner report: “In a memo released by the White House late Monday, Trump’s doctor, Sean Conley, wrote that Trump’s ‘interim checkup’ over the weekend had been ‘routine,’ and was only kept secret because of ‘scheduling uncertainties.’ ‘Despite some speculation, the President has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues,’ Conley wrote in the memo. ‘Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations.’ While Trump claimed that he had begun ‘phase one’ of his annual physical, Conley said Trump would have a ‘more comprehensive examination’ next year. Trump described his condition on Twitter as ‘very good (great!)’; Conley’s memo did not characterize the president’s overall health. It did include cholesterol figures that had dropped since Trump’s last physical exam in February. It is unusual for a president to undergo a physical exam in multiple stages months apart, and the circumstances surrounding Trump’s visit renewed questions about the White House’s handling of his medical information, according to several experts. … Two people who interacted with Trump late last week said that he seemed to be hoarse and have signs of a cold but that nothing serious seemed amiss.”

“Trump’s mysterious hospital visit raises many questions. His explanation for it didn’t answer any of them,” writes the Post’s Editorial Board.

-- Prosecutors are preparing to file charges against two Bureau of Prisons workers who were supposed to regularly check on millionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein the night he hanged himself in his cell. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: “The two corrections workers, whose names have not been released, fell under suspicion immediately after Epstein was found early on the morning of Aug. 10 in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail used primarily for people awaiting trial. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging, although lawyers for the disgraced financier have questioned that conclusion. … The death of the most high-profile defendant in the federal prison system led to a major shake-up at the Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William P. Barr brought in a former director of the agency to run it again, and replaced the top official at the MCC, saying the preliminary investigation had found ‘serious irregularities at the center.’

""Those irregularities include logs indicating that Epstein was checked on regularly, in accordance with MCC procedures. Investigators don’t believe those checks happened … Prosecutors have been focused on charges against the officers of falsifying federal records ... In recent weeks, they sought to have the officers plead guilty, though they refused.”

-- Emails obtained by CBS News show that San Diego billionaire Doug Manchester was pressed by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to donate half a million bucks to the party while his Senate confirmation to become the ambassador to the Bahamas hung in the balance. “Manchester donated $1 million to Mr. Trump's inauguration fund. He was offered the Bahamas post the day after Mr. Trump was sworn in. Manchester said Mr. Trump told him, ‘I should probably be the ambassador to the Bahamas and you should be president.’ Then, for two and a half years, Manchester's nomination stalled in the Senate. … He wrote back to McDaniel's request for $500,000, ‘As you know I am not supposed to do any, but my wife is sending a contribution for $100,000. Assuming I get voted out of the [Foreign Relations Committee] on Wednesday to the floor we need you to have the majority leader bring it to a majority vote … Once confirmed, I our [sic] family will respond!’”

-- The Trump State Department appointee who inflated her résumé has resigned amid fresh questions about the Trump team's clearly flawed vetting process. Reis Thebault reports: In a letter of resignation to Pompeo, Mina Chang “defended herself and criticized the ‘toxic environment’ at the agency, where she had served as a deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations since April. Chang denied creating or commissioning the Time cover and wrote that her resignation should be seen ‘as a protest and not as surrender,’ closing by saying that stepping down was ‘the only acceptable moral and ethical option for me at this time.’ … ‘The Department of State is experiencing what I and many believe is the worst and most profound moral crisis confronting career professionals and political appointees in the Department’s history,’ wrote Chang, who had no diplomatic experience before joining the State Department. …Chang, in her rebuttal document, argued that her ‘background was fully investigated by the FBI and State Department’s Diplomatic Security. No questions were raised or concerns identified during the process.’”

-- In Georgia, Democrats are finding out that turning the state blue is easier to predict than to pull off. Jenna Johnson reports: “Four Gwinnett County Democratic Party leaders gathered on living-room couches to … [address a pressing] priority: In less than a month, Republican state leaders plan to purge the registrations of 330,000 voters who haven’t participated in recent elections — roughly 22,000 of whom are registered in Gwinnett County, many of them likely Democrats. They spent hours debating how best to find these voters and keep them registered, and organizing phone banks, including one ahead of a Democratic debate watch party Wednesday night. Then came a text message from another county party member who had heard that the state party was organizing a similar effort, as was a nonprofit group. ‘We don’t have time for this,’ Bianca Keaton, the first black woman to lead the Gwinnett County Democrats, said with exasperation. ‘We are moving ahead with the plan we made this morning. I don’t want them in Gwinnett County.’ The exchange was yet another reminder that while Democrats see themselves as poised to take over the state, they are a long way from building the kind of coordinated effort that Georgia Republicans — and Democrats in places like Virginia and elsewhere — have long enjoyed.”

-- In Virginia, Democratic lawmakers rushed to file bills as the legislative window opened for next year’s General Assembly session, setting out voting rights, gun control, LGBTQ protections and the Equal Rights Amendment as priorities for their newfound majority. Gregory S. Schneider reports: “It was bad timing for Republican leaders, who traveled to Richmond Monday to officially shut down the special legislative session on gun control that they had cut short over the summer. As the state’s docket began filling with Democratic proposals, Republican leaders presided over the floor of the Senate and House of Delegates for probably the last time before their rivals take over. … House Democrats chose [Democratic Del. Eileen] Filler-Corn as their speaker-designee, putting her in line to be the chamber’s first female leader in its 400-year history. Republicans made no effort Monday to draw attention to proposed legislation, which can be filed until 10 days after the session starts Jan. 8.”

-- Three people were killed during a shooting in a Walmart parking lot in Duncan, Okla. Katie Mettler reports: “The shooting took place just before 10 a.m., reported the Duncan Banner. Officers with the Duncan Police Department responded to the Walmart Supercenter on Highway 81 in Duncan, a city 65 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. A man and woman were found dead inside a car in the parking lot, and another man was found dead outside the car, police said in the statement. It was not immediately clear whether the alleged shooter was among those who died. A handgun was found at the scene, authorities said. The Duncan Banner reported that Red River Technology Center and Duncan Public Schools were put on lockdown.”

-- The shooting at a Fresno, Calif., backyard gathering that left four dead was a targeted attack, police said. Derek Hawkins, Katie Shpeherd and Katie Mettler report: “The shooting stunned Southeast Asian Hmong residents in Fresno, which is home to the largest Hmong population in California and the second-largest Hmong population in the United States. … The attackers, armed with semiautomatic pistols, fled on foot before partygoers could make out their faces in the darkness, police said. … Fresno Police Deputy Chief Andrew Hall said the department was mobilizing an ‘Asian gang task force’ to investigate whether the attack was connected to recent a spike in violent crime in the city by Asian gangs. There was no indication that the residents were involved in gangs, he said, but investigators believe the gunman intentionally targeted the house.”

-- About 60 percent of Superfund sites overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency could be hit by climate change, a new Government Accountability Office report found. Dino Grandoni and Brady Dennis report: “GAO investigators said the agency needs to take more aggressive action to acknowledge risks facing some of the nation’s most polluted sites — and to safeguard them amid a changing climate. Even as they agreed with the GAO on certain points, Trump administration officials formally rejected a recommendation to clarify how preparing toxic sites to withstand the impacts of climate change is part of the EPA’s mission.”

-- WeWork could lay off thousands of employees as the company tries to recover from a disastrous attempt to go public. Marie C. Baca reports: “That means WeWork could lose about a third of the 12,500-person head count it had in June, according to a company filing. WeWork Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure told employees that layoffs would begin this week."" There are also reports that the New York attorney general is investigating the former chief executive for alleged self-dealing.

For days leading up to Wednesday’s Democratic debate, Pete Buttigieg and his team tried to figure out what was about to hit them. With the mayor on the rise in early state polling, it was time for him to be treated like a front-runner onstage, they figured, and that probably meant he’d face real heat from his opponents for the first time this campaign. Prepping in Las Vegas and then Atlanta, they thought the inevitable criticisms would focus on three potentially vulnerable areas for him: his lack of support with black voters (which he’s been struggling to answer for), his lack of experience (“The guy was born, in political terms, six months ago,” one prominent Buttigieg supporter told me before the debate), and the mysterious nature of his postcollege corporate work for McKinsey (he released two years’ worth of tax records hours before the debate to try to preempt some of the questions).

But then, for two hours on Wednesday night, the field held off.

Kamala Harris looked like she was previewing a swipe at Buttigieg when she dismissively repurposed Buttigieg’s assertion that Trump’s eventual departure from the White House would be “a tender moment in the life of this country.” (Harris said, “There is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice on the ballot.”) But she then passed on an easy chance to criticize his African-American outreach stumbles, noting that he’d apologized for an embarrassing mistake involving a stock photo from Kenya. Soon after it looked like Cory Booker’s turn, but he also let Buttigieg mostly off the hook by leaving his name out of an indirect jab: “I have a lifetime of experience with black voters, I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters,” an apparent allusion to yet another story of Buttigieg’s clumsy efforts. Even Amy Klobuchar, who’s been one of the most critical voices of Buttigieg’s inexperience, demurred when asked early on to expand on those criticisms.

It took until the closing stretch of the evening in Georgia for Klobuchar to finally go there — “I have won statewide, and mayor, I have appreciation for all your good work as a local official,” she said, “I also have actually done this work, I think experience should matter” — before Tulsi Gabbard unexpectedly swooped in with a critique of a recent Buttigieg quote about military cooperation with Mexico.

It was hardly the Buttigieg pile-on the candidate’s team, and the media, was expecting.

That’s because his opponents are still trying to figure out what kind of front-runner he is.

A few hours before the debate, a senior Joe Biden campaign official insisted that Buttigieg’s voters in Iowa were far from locked in for the mayor, and that they were still eminently winnable for the former vice-president because even sympathetic Iowans were not yet convinced Buttigieg could ultimately beat Trump. The mayor’s current strong standing, in other words, is not necessarily sustainable in the eyes of some of his competitors, who are waiting to see if it crumbles on its own before they force the issue and accidentally give Buttigieg an extra moment or two in the spotlight — like Gabbard ended up doing in the night’s final moments. “@PeteButtigieg has been the best debater in the previous debates. So what do you do to not give him a moment for writers to write about? You don’t attack him. You don’t treat him as a surging candidate,” tweeted Michael Ceraso, Buttigieg’s former New Hampshire state director, before that exchange. “Smart play by all the candidates.”

And while many of the other candidates entered the debate hoping Buttigieg would be knocked down a peg, few of them saw any individual incentive to be the one to actually do it — and risk turning off crucial voters and donors who are currently on Buttigieg’s side and view him very favorably. Asked earlier in the day if Biden would take on the issue of Buttigieg’s youth, which would appear to be an obvious line of attack for the longest-tenured pol in the field, another of his senior staffers said it was unlikely: All contrasts onstage would probably be implicit. “There is an inherent comparison there,” the aide said.

Campaigns, though, do not revolve solely around debates, and Buttigieg and his opponents alike now still expect him to come in for a round of real-time vetting.

In South Bend, his team is still working on figuring out what potential lines of attack his rivals might take within the three general vulnerabilities they’ve identified, now that the scrutiny-free stage of his campaign is over. “The campaign did not want a target on its back,” said one wired-in Buttigieg ally, a political veteran with experience with multiple presidential campaigns. But, he said, this moment in the sun was always coming: “It was always genuinely my belief he was way undervalued by the market because people were driven by national polls, and there was this narrative that Joe Biden is a decent guy who will not alienate working-class whites and that is the way to defeat Donald Trump. And it sort of overlooked, How is Biden when he has to interact with other human beings?”

Buttigieg has said he is trying to get released from a nondisclosure agreement with McKinsey, which would allow him to explain the true nature of his work for the consulting giant that has a history of contracting with dubious clients, both domestically and abroad. For now, said another (hopeful) Democrat close to the Buttigieg camp, “It’s hard to hit him with an integrity question — he doesn’t have a long record and he comes across as a good dude.” Yet the candidate has found no easy answer but to release tax returns disclosing his income — an attempt to deflect attention to Elizabeth Warren’s corporate law work hasn’t really worked. In the meantime, opponents will continue to raise questions about what’s essentially a glaring unknown on his short résumé.

And his answer to Klobuchar’s experience knock onstage was effective — “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters, there’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?” the 37-year-old said, before talking about his deployment. Even those close to him think he may need more than that, though none of them are sure what that should look like, or how to accomplish that without detracting from the central premise of his campaign: that he represents a generational change.

Perhaps his biggest challenge, though, is not an incoming line of attack, but a more fundamental issue: his meager support among black voters, who make up a huge portion of the Democratic primary electorate after the first two states vote.

It’s not the kind of issue that can be solved with a convincing debate-stage retort, Buttigieg’s allies acknowledge, though his rivals’ apparent willingness to talk about it on the campaign trail, if not the nationally televised stage, shows no signs of abating. So the urgency of his problem is only growing.

Buttigieg didn’t start building up a meaningful presence in South Carolina, the first state in the primary process where black voters represent a majority of the electorate, until late summer and early fall, and he is now figuring out what it will take to try to make a respectable showing there in February. He’s been stuck at zero percent support among the state’s black voters, but in the coming weeks he will likely spend considerable time in South Carolina trying to change that, multiple Democrats briefed on strategic conversations predicted.

In the view of the optimists in the mayor’s newly ballooning orbit, much of the other knocks on him come from jealousy and frustration. (“It’s the same dynamic that existed among the insiders about Obama in ’07,” one Buttigieg donor said to me before the debate.) This concern is the real one."

Here we are again. For the fifth time in five months, a bafflingly numerous bunch of Democratic presidential candidates just spent two hours engaged in the talking points-recitation competition we call a “debate” in our sorry excuse for a democracy. And now, once again, you’re shouting into the void (and/or, Google’s search bar), demanding answers to questions like “Who won the Democratic debate?” or “Who were the winners of the Democratic debate?” And you expect me, or someone like me — a college-educated, New York City-based journalist who reads about politics all day every day, and is thus uniquely unqualified to see this tedious carnival through the eyes of the median Democratic voter — to tell you what it all added up to, in the end.

Well, if you insist. Here are the five winners of last night’s fifth Democratic debate:

1) Cory Booker.

The New Jersey senator has made a regular habit of (figuratively) disembowling Joe Biden in the most jovial way imaginable. At debate after debate, like a psychopathic Ned Flanders, Booker has gone medieval on the old man without ever ceasing to smile or spout cringe-inducingly corny one-liners. In August, Booker took Biden to task for his record on criminal justice while dropping witticisms like, “You’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor.”

On Wednesday, Booker was at it again, ripping Biden’s failure to fully unlearn his drug-warrior ways while quipping, “This week, I hear [Biden] literally say that ‘I don’t think we should legalize marijuana’ — I thought you might have been high when you said it!”

Booker: “Marijuana is already legal for privileged people. The war on drugs has been a war on Black & Brown people.

Now, Booker has racked up more critically acclaimed debate performances this year than percentage points of voter support. The safe assumption is that his latest cheerful assault will prove as politically impotent as the previous ones. But there’s at least one reason to think his latest jab at Biden might prove more potent: Whereas previous attacks on the Democratic frontrunner have focused on Biden’s historic betrayals of contemporary Democratic orthodoxy — or else, the former vice-president’s spurning of today’s progressive vanguard — Booker targeted an issue where the elder statesman is truly behind the times: Two thirds of the American public supports marijuana legalization. Among Democratic primary voters, that percentage is even higher. Virtually every non-Biden candidate, from Amy Klobuchar to Bernie Sanders, is high on legal weed. Biden’s reluctance to make peace with marijuana legalization, like his constant struggles to find his way around an English sentence, is a reminder that there may be some downsides to nominating the oldest moderate on offer.

It really shook things up.

3) Pete Buttigieg.

The South Bend mayor entered Wednesday’s debate riding high. In recent weeks, Buttigieg’s support has surged in both Iowa and New Hampshire. In the Hawkeye State, the most recent Des Moines Register poll found mayor Pete leading the Democratic field by ten points. Buttigieg’s rise was widely attributed to Elizabeth Warren’s recent decline, which was itself an ostensible product of the barrage of attacks her campaign had attracted following its own polling surge a little over a month ago. Thus, conventional wisdom held that Wednesday would be Pete’s turn to run the gauntlet: Surely, low-polling center-left candidates would relish this opportunity to expose the wunderkind for the underqualified, overpolished, ladder-climbing, backbiting McKinsey consultant he truly is.

But that didn’t happen. Instead, Kamala Harris & Co. all played the debate equivalent of the prevent defense. Even when moderators tried to bait the California senator into taking a swipe at Buttigieg, she largely resisted. Apparently, while everyone wants to see Pete get taken down a notch, no one wants to sign up for that task themselves, given his high favorability numbers among Democratic voters.

The only candidate who really went after Pete Wednesday was Tulsi Gabbard — who also chose to frame herself as a staunch opponent of the Democratic Party.

With enemies like that, Pete doesn’t need friends.

4) People who are not professionally obligated to watch Democratic primary debates.

I’m so tired.

5) Joe Biden.

The former vice-president began his debate night in the early afternoon — when his campaign asked its supporters if he had made them proud at the future debate that had just passed.

""I’m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now,"" Biden says in email to supporters hours before the debate has started pic.twitter.com/QrtoWlCgZP — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) November 20, 2019

Biden’s actual performance was about as smooth and coherent as that email. The Democratic frontrunner couldn’t even get through the first two sentences of his opening statement without stumbling, his remarks beginning with a tautology and ending in gibberish: “The next president of the United States is going to have to do two things: Defeat Donald Trump, that’s number one. And, number two, going to have to be able make be …”

Later, he argued that the only way to solve the problem of sexual violence was to “keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.” He looked and sounded too old to be out past 10 p.m., let alone, to be president of the United States for at least four years, beginning over one year from now.

Which is exactly how he has looked and sounded in all of his previous debate performances. And yet, he still boasts a double-digit lead in national polls over his closest competitor, while no other candidate has showed any sign of threatening his grip on the African-American vote. So, this was, ostensibly, the ideal debate showing. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like:

As is often the case, Politico nicely summed up the conventional wisdom going into the fifth presidential candidates’ debate in Atlanta:

Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. And that makes the debate a serious threat for him …

“Everyone’s going to come for Pete. There’s a target on his back — no question about it. That’s what happens when you jump in the polls,” said Jon Soltz, executive director of VoteVets, a progressive group that backs veterans for office but hasn’t endorsed in the presidential primary.

Buttigieg, after all, has been surging in Iowa and New Hampshire polls, and is reportedly drawing support from the previous candidate-on-fire Elizabeth Warren, while cutting off oxygen to a passel of low-polling candidates who are yearning to be the centrist alternative to Biden. And Biden himself has to fear that the shadowy but powerful group of donors and opinion leaders who have been frantically looking for a Plan B to his own self will decide Mayor Pete will work just fine.

But nobody other than Tulsi Gabbard — at the very end — went after Buttigieg at all. Indeed, while you can make a case that Warren or Klobuchar or Booker or Sanders did better than Buttigieg in Atlanta, he did just fine (He also did fine in his tangle with Gabbard) and the expected pile-on just didn’t happen.

Why didn’t anyone but Gabbard go after him? In my own article on Buttigieg’s “moment,” I wondered if he was peaking too soon, particularly in Iowa — a question that might be lingering in the minds of his rivals. Perhaps a couple of state polls wasn’t enough to convince them that Petementum is real. It’s also possible that his perpetual and well-documented problem in attracting nonwhite support makes his candidacy seem less formidable, and making him a less inviting target. Even if he does well in the heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, it’s quite possible he will have trouble carrying that momentum over to South Carolina and other southern, northeastern, and midwestern states, not to mention California.

Mayor Pete’s improbably successful campaign is improbably floating above the fray — at least for now. But if Buttigieg’s poll standings stay aloft heading toward the end of the year, the odds of him escaping the December debate in Los Angeles without taking fire from every direction will be low. And as the Iowa Caucuses grow nigh, if Buttigieg is barnstorming across that state as his senatorial allies are stuck in an impeachment trial in Washington, they may wish they had taken him down a notch earlier."

Young people who do not go to college tend to be more economically disadvantaged than those who do. This is not solely a function of rising tuition costs. For one thing, the peripheral costs of college attendance — from lost wages to books to housing — are often more formidable obstacles for working-class kids than tuition. For another, children from low-income households are not merely less likely to attend a university, but also, to be eligible to attend one, due to class disparities in high-school graduation rates. Separately, Americans who do have the opportunity to attend college generally enjoy higher incomes and living standards later in life than those who do not.

The U.S. economy does not have an insatiable demand for college-educated labor. According to federal projections, most of the fastest-growing occupations in the U.S. do not require a four-year degree. This means that we need a significant percentage of our young people to accrue forms of knowledge, skill, and experience that colleges aren’t designed to provide. If young Americans with little interest in — or aptitude for — higher education did not exist, we would need to invent them.

Given these realities, one can reasonably argue that tuition-free college should not be a priority of the progressive movement. To the extent that the next Democratic president’s capacity to enact new laws is constrained by Congress’s legislative calendar and moderates’ limited appetite for new spending, there will ostensibly be more progressive things for him or her to spend $70 billion on than a social benefit that America’s most disadvantaged young people are ineligible for, almost by definition.

On the other hand, this same basic logic could have been deployed in opposition to tuition-free 12th grade a generation ago (after all, the most disadvantaged students drop out before senior year). If we believe that the value of public education isn’t limited to its function as a generator of human capital or labor-force readiness — and thus, that it does not merely benefit its direct recipients but also, society as a whole — then the distributional implications of tuition-free college don’t necessarily matter. (In my own view, the growing correlation between college-degree attainment and immunity to xenophobic nationalism strengthens the case for seeing higher education as a broad social good.)

And anyway, as Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project has argued, there are ways to integrate free public college into a more inclusive, universalist program for helping young adults refine their skills and attach to the labor force:

[W]e should as a society designate ages 18–24 as the attachment zone during which all paths into a career are fully supported by public benefits and services. Students get their free school. But, under the exact same umbrella, nonstudents get their free vocational training, subsidized apprenticeships, in-work subsidies, public jobs, and whatever else it takes to ensure a lasting labor force attachment. That would be a program that is actually in fitting with the ideals of universalism.

All of which is to say: There are worthwhile intra-Democratic debates to be had over tuition-free college, including ones that interrogate its distributional impacts.

But Pete Buttigieg’s latest broadside against the policy is not one of them:

Instead of providing free college tuition for the children of millionaires and billionaires, I will open doors of opportunity for Americans who choose not to go to college with massive investments in apprenticeships, workforce training, and lifelong learning programs. — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) November 19, 2019

The serious distributional critique of free college is not that it would benefit the children of “billionaires,” but that it would deliver less benefit to the poor than it would to the upper-middle class. But the upper-middle class is Mayor Pete’s core constituency. And so, his campaign has chosen to argue that the only thing preventing the superrich from flooding our public universities with their progeny is the exorbitant cost of out-of-state tuition.

Now, if Pete had restricted his complaint to millionaires, he’d have something closer to a point. (Many upper-middle-class families do own more than $1 million in assets.) According to the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal, children whose parents are in the top one percent of earners would commandeer a whopping 1.4 percent of spending on tuition-free college. It’s hard to see why that sum should be a dealbreaker, especially if the policy is funded with higher taxes on the rich. Still, it isn’t literally nothing.

If Konczal restricted his estimates to billionaires however, it would be pretty darn close to zero percent. There are just over 600 billionaires in the entire United States, and they are not known for sending their kids to public schools. At present, the average cost of out-of-state tuition at a public university in the U.S. is $25,000. As a percentage of one’s spending power, $25,000 is for a (low-digit) billionaire what one movie ticket is for the median American household. It’s ludicrous to think that making public college tuition-free would cause billionaires to send their kids to public universities in droves, especially when one considers that once public higher education is tuition-free, a public-college diploma will be an even weaker marker of elite status than it already is.

And yet, the biggest problem with Pete’s fear of Americans’ footing the bill for the college-bound children of billionaires may be this: If it were actually true that making public college tuition-free would cause billionaire trust-fund kids to start sharing classrooms and social circles with working-class adolescents, that would make the case for tuition-free college stronger. After all, reams of educational research has shown low-income students derive massive benefits from attending schools with more privileged peers. Redistribute billionaire children from selective private colleges to public universities, and you’ll have progressively redistributed large sums of social capital, while rendering America’s institutions of higher education more socioeconomically diverse. Pete Buttigieg, of all people, should see the virtue in that outcome: After all, the South Bend Mayor has proposed a national service program aimed at getting America’s young people out of their “distinct bubbles.”

Tuition-free public college won’t deliver much of any benefit to the children of billionaires. But it would be an even more worthwhile program if it did."

If you are a 37-year-old pol with a mixed record as mayor of the 305th-largest city in America running for president against six sitting United States senators and a front-runner who entered the Senate a decade before you were born, you will need to make a virtue of being a young outsider. Pete Buttigieg is going beyond making the defensive case that he’s not too young or inexperienced for the job; he’s turning it into a positive electability argument. Here’s how he put it to GQ’s Jason Zengerle:

“Every time Democrats have succeeded in the last 50 years, it’s been with a new-generation figure who’s not been marinating in Washington for a long time,” he told me. “Every time we’ve tried to go with the kind of safe, established, been-here-for-a-long-time kind of figure, we have come up short. This isn’t just a pattern. This is an iron, unbroken law going back to the ‘60s.”

Now there’s some chutzpah, folks. No wonder Zengerle’s piece is titled “The Audacity of Pete Buttigieg.”

But how about his historical claim? To begin with, the ranks of Democratic presidential winners in the last 50 years is a classic small sample: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. If you go back another 50 years, there are four Democratic presidents, three of them U.S. senators (LBJ, JFK, and Truman), and the fourth, FDR, a veteran of national politics who had been assistant secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson. Buttigieg does not offer any particular reason to make 1969 the crucial year when being a Washingtonian stopped being an asset and started violating an “iron, unbroken law.”

The three predecessors he does claim had things going for them beyond being young, inexperienced, and from outside Washington.

Carter ran for president at the precise moment in history where it again became possible and advantageous for a white, Deep South Democrat to take the plunge. He became nationally popular by slaying the dragon of George Wallace’s terrifying candidacy, and then narrowly won the presidency mostly because he was uniquely able to lash together a coalition of liberals and conservatives that included former civil-rights workers and career racists (including Wallace) to sweep the South and southern-inflected areas. He was 51, not all that young, and had served in statewide office.

Obama, of course, was a U.S. senator (albeit a freshman), but being relatively young and inexperienced was not the most prominent thing about his candidacy: Like Carter, he had an identity advantage that turned out to be crucial.

And yes, Clinton was a governor, but by the time he ran for president he was quite well-known in national political circles. In 1990, I wrote a speech for my then-boss Sam Nunn introducing Clinton as “the first politician to become a bright, rising star in three different decades.” It got a big laugh because it was true.

The context in which these “outsiders” got into the White House mattered, too. Carter and Clinton ran against incumbent presidents who were struggling through tough economic times; Carter had the additional edge of running after Watergate had tainted Washington and the GOP. Obama’s opponent, John McCain, another longtime Washington veteran, was famously about as different from Donald J. Trump as another white Republican could possibly be.

None of this is to deny there is a kernel of truth in what Buttigieg said. All other things being equal, getting one’s experience in politics and government outside Washington can be a positive, particularly for those in what is often perceived as the “party of Big Government.” Carter, Clinton, and Obama definitely took advantage of their backgrounds and the Washington pedigrees of their rivals. And Buttigieg has some other things in common with past winner: his own claim to a “historic” identity as the first viable openly gay presidential contender, a connection with a crucial midwestern battleground region, and his obvious charm and intelligence.

Still, Mayor Pete should be careful with this “iron, unbroken law” language. If he loses the nomination battle to one of his senatorial (or vice-presidential) rivals and is out there campaigning for the winner, as he surely will, it’s the sort of, well, audacious remark that could come back to haunt him."

Though it may be difficult to focus on anything other than Gordon Sondland’s explosive impeachment testimony, there’s a Democratic debate happening on Wednesday night in Atlanta. With Pete Buttigieg surging in Iowa, the one thing most observers expect is for the South Bend mayor to come in for some criticism from his fellow candidates. I chatted with national political correspondent Gabriel Debenedetti about what to expect.

Ben: After all the winnowing that was supposed to happen this fall, we’ve still got ten candidates onstage Wednesday night in Atlanta. But right now, the race features a clear top four: Biden, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg. The South Bend mayor has everyone on notice with his solid lead in Iowa in a recent poll, which came on the heels of his aggressive jab at Elizabeth Warren in the last debate over her health-care plan. This means that Mayor Pete, who has high favorability numbers and not a ton of criticism from his rivals thus far, is ripe for attack. Do you expect that he’ll be the central focus of incoming fire from other candidates?

Gabriel: Well, first, let’s note that his big number came in a poll of Iowa, which is super-important, but not the whole ball game. I still wouldn’t call him the national front-runner. But, that said… Yeah, it’s only logical, but it’s also been the pattern so far. Biden got the brunt of the fire in the first debate, Warren in the last one, and so on. Buttigieg’s team seems to be getting ready for this. To me, one of the big questions is whether Warren goes after him. She hasn’t yet done anything like that in any of the preceding debates, but obviously Buttigieg’s rise has appeared to eclipse her own in Iowa.

Ben: And when she released her new health-care plan last week, which puts Medicare for All on the back burner, he came out with a statement accusing her of wanting to kick 100-something million people off their health insurance. So I could see some version of “Are you a Republican or a Democrat?”

Gabriel: Warren, and some others, have repeatedly used the “let’s not use Republican talking points” line, but she got a good deal of blowback for suggesting Biden was running in the wrong primary when discussing health care a few weeks ago, so we’ll see which direction she goes. I’ll be really curious to see how central health care is in this debate. It’s dominated every one until now, basically, and it’s clearly been extremely important to the national conversation even outside of the debates. But now that the race feels like it’s in a new stage and we’ve got juuust a little impeachment news flooding the ecosystem, that calculus may change for the moderators.

Ben: I was sort of hoping that we wouldn’t begin with yet another 30-minute health-care section in which the moderator repeatedly asks Elizabeth Warren whether her plan will raise taxes on the middle class. (Though she does have a clearer answer for that now, thanks to her new proposal.) But yeah, it’s not getting any less important as a central issue in Democratic primary voters’ minds.

Gabriel: Absolutely not, it’s clearly top of mind, and it should still be treated as such. And Warren is almost definitely going to have to talk about her plan now that she’s released details. So how do you think she and Buttigieg will face off on this topic?

And will we get more policy chatter that all blends together over an hour, and allows Sanders to come out of it all looking calm while everyone else has had to defend themselves repeatedly?

Ben: I think it might be awkward for Buttigieg, because Warren has now basically proposed the same thing he has — Medicare for those who want it — just a more generous version. And he can say that she’s flip-flopped on the issue, but (a) I don’t know how much voters will care as long as she’s not still attaching herself to Medicare for All, and (b) he can credibly be accused of having done the same, since he made what appeared to be a very conscious swing to the center on this issue in recent weeks.

Gabriel: So the answer to my second question is “yeah.”

Ben: Haha. I think it’s possible. Sanders has somehow faded into the background while at the same time boosting his poll numbers, post–heart attack. This seems to be a good spot for him.

Gabriel: Yes, though in the last debate no one went after him because he was (a) immediately post–heart attack, and (b) thought to be fading. Neither of those is still the case. So he may find himself on defense, though. Again, I’m hoping this debate touches on things other than health care. On that front, I wouldn’t be surprised if Buttigieg is asked to speak about his corporate work for McKinsey, which he rarely talks about and has to answer for.

Ben: Yeah, that’s a bit of a black hole for him.

Gabriel: Like with so many other things, it’s possible he has a good answer for these questions now, we just have no idea because his time in the harsh spotlight hasn’t yet come.

Ben: It seems Joe Biden, like Bernie, has had a pretty smooth stretch — no big errors (unless you count his stance on weed), no alarming slips of the tongue — and he still holds healthy leads in most state polls, and continues to dominate among black voters. Might there be a renewed attempt to go after him aggressively, the way Kamala Harris did, or is there still this notion that he’ll just fade away at some point — which looks less and less likely?

Gabriel: I would never rule out the possibility that someone might go after Biden harshly, but it hasn’t worked for anyone who’s tried it. Not just Harris, but Booker and Castro and Swalwell and … I do think that the candidates outside of the top four will feel immense pressure to have big, memorable performances, but the truth is none of us knows what exactly that would have to look like to actually change their lot in the race.

Ben: Oh right, the other six candidates. It seems Klobuchar is having a bit of a surge in Iowa — she’ll probably keep making the “I can win in a purple state” case, right?

Gabriel: I don’t see why she wouldn’t, that’s her whole pitch. Klobuchar is doing better in Iowa, and she basically came into the last debate with the same plan as Buttigieg — to go after Warren on health care. So perhaps she’ll try that again, since everyone expects Buttigieg to get most of the pressure this time, giving her more time and space. But Booker and Steyer and Yang and Gabbard have yet to qualify for the December debate, and so they most desperately need something to happen.

Ben: Though, as I understand it, the latter three are very likely to, needing just one more poll or a gettable number of donors. Whereas Booker may be looking at the end of the line.

Gabriel: I don’t know about “very likely,” but yes, they certainly are confident they’ll be there. Booker, less so. Not that that’s the end of the line for him, of course. There are still sevenish candidates running who haven’t sniffed the debate stage in months (or at all)!

Ben: Riiight.

Gabriel: Anyway …! The feeling around this debate is pretty strange, I have to say, since so much of the attention is elsewhere, and since everyone I’ve talked to in campaign world agrees that the first thing they’re watching for is how Pete takes a hit. (It’s rare to have such agreement about What Matters and The Narrative.)

Ben: Ah yes, the whole impeachment thing. I’ve seen criticisms of past debates that take issue with how little Trump — you know, the existential threat to the country — is mentioned. But do the candidates have any disagreements about what’s going down in Washington right now? I’m not sure what there is to say.

Gabriel: They have philosophical disagreements about how central it is to the country’s ills, absolutely. And since one read of presidential primaries is that they’re audition processes for the general election, it might be useful to hear the candidates all talk about the most important thing happening, which will almost certainly be central to the general election no matter what. (Trump’s various misdeeds, that is, if not the Ukraine scandal specifically.) There’s a reason it’s been (momentarily, at least) effective whenever candidates say onstage, “Hang on, why are we talking about this? Trump is president!!” in the middle of some policy discussion where the disagreement is marginal.

Ben: Yeah. And gives them a chance to look reasonable and collegial, too.

Gabriel: Which, y’know, they basically are.

Ben: Says YOU.

Gabriel: I yield my time to the chairman."

Gabriel Debenedetti, Intelligencer’s national political correspondent, attended the Democratic debate in Atlanta Wednesday night. I spoke with him about his impressions from an evening that came at the end of a long day of political drama in Washington — and seemed to suffer for it at times.

Ben: Given that we did a whole chat about how Pete Buttigieg would be the central target of attack at Wednesday night’s debate and then that didn’t really happen (except when Tulsi Gabbard rather incoherently went after him toward the end), I feel I have to begin there. Why didn’t everyone pile on the mayor, as expected?

Gabriel: Well, I’ll have a full story on this tomorrow (check back, folks!), but the short answer is that the other candidates basically calculated that while they want to see Buttigieg fall, it wasn’t in any of their individual interests to be the one to carry out the take-down. We saw something similar the first time Warren was considered a front-runner a few months ago — the real fire came the next debate.

Ben: Set your clocks to December 19, the date of the next debate. That is, if Buttigieg is still leading in Iowa at that point.

Gabriel: But don’t, like, sleep until then. There’s a lot going on, Ben!

Ben: The online consensus seemed to be that this debate — at least for most of its running time — lacked the spark and energy of some previous installments, almost as if the candidates were as tired as political journalists who had spent all day covering impeachment. (Not to make it about us or anything.) From your vantage point down there in Atlanta, did you feel the same way?

Gabriel: Here in the media filing center, it certainly felt like everyone was waiting for … something that just didn’t happen. But a lot of the debates have felt like that, in person. There were certainly lots of spicy moments, when you think back on it, but it’s hard to point to any one, or any single exchange that’s certain to break through in the daily news coverage. Feels inevitable that Gordon Sondland’s testimony — and tomorrow’s impeachment developments — have that space locked down.

Ben: The spiciest exchange may have been Tulsi Gabbard versus Kamala Harris, who went after the Hawaiian for cozying up with Steve Bannon and ragging on the Democratic party. That duo wasn’t exactly on the marquee.

Gabriel: Tulsi Gabbard versus Pete Buttigieg was also quite an event there at the end, and Cory Booker had a few memorable lines, there, too. But if we’ve learned one lesson from these debates, it’s maybe that it’s really very difficult to predict what’s going to matter to, or stick with, the actual voters.

Ben: In that vein, Joe Biden looked a little groggy at the beginning there, but, unlike in previous debates, seemed to gain strength as the night wore on. He did have a couple of cringey moments — he said violence against women was never okay but then specified that there’s an exception if it’s self-defense, and he said he had earned support from the only black woman ever elected to the Senate, seeming to forget that Kamala Harris was standing feet away. But given that similar or worse gaffes on debate stages have done nothing to dent his support, it seems unlikely that these will.

Gabriel: I think we’re well past the point where rival campaigns are expecting Biden’s gaffes, if that’s what we’re going to call them, to materially change the shape of things. And in fact, Team Biden is likely to be pretty happy with the way this shaped up — they were very eager to have Biden talk foreign policy on a national debate stage at some point.

Ben: To my eyes, nobody really damaged themselves in any major way, except maybe Gabbard — Warren and Bernie both turned in strong performances, Buttigieg did what he had to do. And some of the non-frontrunners did quite well, too. Klobuchar had an excellent night, Andrew Yang had some good moments, and Kamala Harris turned in her best performance in months. Do you think anyone who really needed a boost helped their case particularly well? (And do you disagree with any of the assessments I laid out?)

Gabriel: Fair to say Gabbard may have made it difficult for herself to gain a ton of new voters tonight, but her own core supporters tend to like performances like these, so I’m not sure she’ll see the evening as a terrible disaster. However, I think Booker in particular will be happy with his time onstage. He’s the one who maybe needed the most help to get on the next debate stage, and his ad-libbed closing — invoking John Lewis — seemed to really hit home here.

Ben: Oh right, him! He was good, too.

Gabriel: … and therein lies his problem."

Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, E.U. ambassador Gordon Sondland’s impeachment testimony, last night’s Democratic debate, and Prince Andrew’s disastrous interview.

In yesterday’s impeachment testimony, Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised his earlier statements, saying that he “followed the president’s orders” and summing up, simply, “Was there a ‘quid pro quo’? … The answer is yes.” How damaging is Sondland’s testimony for the Republicans’ defense of Trump?

If the Republicans cared about the facts or the gravity of the crime being investigated, the answer would be apocalyptically damaging. But they don’t care, and they will continue to defend Trump even if those testifying under oath include an eyewitness to a criminal conspiracy hatched in the White House like Sondland, or patriots like Fiona Hill, Alexander Vindman, and Marie Yovanovitch, who not only provided irrefutable evidence of the crime but detailed the existential threat that crime poses to America.

Had Trump pulled out that (so far) proverbial gun and shot someone on Fifth Avenue, Republicans would trot out the exact same defense they have this week: The shot was fired at 2 a.m. and there were no eyewitnesses. Those nearby who claimed to have heard the shot had actually heard a car backfiring. The closed-circuit video capturing the incident is, as the president says, a hoax concocted by the same Fake News outlets that manufactured the Access Hollywood video. The confession released by the White House was “perfect” evidence of Trump’s innocence. Election records show that the cops who arrived on the scene were registered Democrats and therefore part of a deep-state conspiracy to frame the president for a crime he didn’t commit but that the Democrats did. The victim was not killed and will make a complete recovery, so no crime was committed anyway. And even if Trump had killed the young woman he gunned down, the argument advanced by Trump’s lawyer last month would apply: “The person who serves as president, while in office, enjoys absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind.” Next case!

The crime Trump actually is accused of is far more severe than that imaginary shooting in any event. He and his co-conspirators, including the vice-president and secretary of State, were guilty of aiding Vladimir Putin’s plan to bludgeon Ukraine, an American ally, and, in Fiona Hill’s language, “to weaken our country” as well. That Putin’s foremost goal is to sabotage the electoral process that is the beating heart of our democracy doesn’t seem to matter a whit to Vichy Republicans. If the devastating facts unfurled with great clarity by Adam Schiff’s committee has failed to move them, what would? History — particularly the history of the prominent political figures in England, France, and the United States who appeased and collaborated with Germany during the Nazis rise to power — suggests that they will only be moved to speak up when it’s too late.

Last night’s Democratic debate was the first held since Pete Buttigieg has climbed into the top tier of candidates, and attempted to weather the level of scrutiny that comes with that position. How did he do?



The proof that no one knows what the hell is happening at this point in the Democratic primary was the nearly uniform pre-debate prediction by journalists and politicians that the evening’s main event would be Buttigieg takedowns. Eyeing Mayor Pete’s rise in polling in his state, the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack put it this way earlier this week: “He may be able to take a punch. He may not. We just don’t know.” And we still don’t. Except for a scuffle with the soon-to-depart Tulsi Gabbard in the final moments, Buttigieg received at most light taps from his actual rivals and deflected them with ease. That said, to me his easy-listening unflappability still seems to be the voice of a McKinsey consultant, which he once was.

One thing we can all agree on is that the Democrats will not win if they bore the electorate to tears. Yes, many voters may be looking to swing the pendulum away from a president whose style is to compulsively provide entertainment (or at least his brand of it) 24/7. But the overall inability of the candidates to engage with each other passionately before a national television audience last night leaves you wondering how much they are engaging even with the core audience tuning into a debate broadcast on MSNBC.

Did anyone learn anything new last night? Bernie Sanders continues to bounce back impressively from his heart attack. The debate did not illuminate where Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All plan stands after the seeming hedging of recent days. Joe Biden still cannot get through an unrehearsed answer without slipping into incoherence, irrelevance, or both. Amy Klochubar still can’t quit making scripted quips that she delivers as if to emphasize how canned they are (last night’s: “I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends”). While Cory Booker declared that he is not looking for “a kumbaya moment” as president, he still conveys the sunny, broad good will of kumbaya more successfully than any compelling policy ideas. Kamala Harris’s tough prosecutorial intelligence continues to lack a third dimension onstage. The best to be said about Tom Steyer is that he’s not Howard Schultz. In the novelty spot, Andrew Yang is not nearly as fascinating as Marianne Williamson.

Even though Michael Bloomberg has scant chance of winning the Democratic nomination, he couldn’t jump in soon enough. He’s a billionaire who has actually done things in public life — good, bad, and indifferent. His long record and his money will shake things up. The Democratic field needs a jolt. To use a Biden metaphor from a previous debate, watching this one was like listening to a record player when the needle is stuck.

In the wake of a disastrous BBC interview about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew has announced that he will “step back from public duties” for the near future. Will this decision shield him from further repercussions?



A British friend of mine observes that Prince Andrew’s BBC interview has united her country for the first time since Brexit. No one believed him, and no viewer was left unappalled. I don’t know what “further repercussions” could befall him even if there was evidence that he raped a girl in Epstein’s Manhattan mansion. I’m no lawyer, but wouldn’t this require the Palace to allow his extradition to the United States? In any case, as a public figure, the prince is done, except as a possible role for Ricky Gervais in season five of The Crown.

I’m much more interested in the repercussions for the various see-no-evil, hear-no-evil American Establishment figures who hung out with Epstein, in some cases took his money and favors or gave him money and favors, and are skating away (or trying to): Alan Dershowitz, Leslie Wexner, and Leon Black most of all in terms of documented interaction with Epstein, but also such hangers-on as Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, not to mention the Harvard retinue led by Larry Summers and Steven Pinker. Go to YouTube, watch the roughly 50-minute Prince Andrew interview in its entirety, and imagine all these American Establishment men being subjected to a similarly rigorous inquiry. It will chill the blood."

When weird stuff happens in politics, it sometimes seems appropriate to resort to weird theories in order to explain it all. That’s probably what drove The New Republic’s Alex Pareene to speculate that late entries into the 2020 presidential contest by Mike Bloomberg and Deval Patrick represent a gamble by shadowy Democratic elites on a “brokered convention” in Milwaukee next July.

[T]his is the only way these two late entrants make any sense. The Patrick and Bloomberg campaigns are not mere long-shots, or attempts to harm Sanders or Warren on behalf of the moderates. They are calculated bets on a brokered convention. These are well-connected people at the highest levels of Democratic Party politics (despite his independent status, Bloomberg has always surrounded himself with Democratic campaign veterans and aides), making it clear that they believe there is a real chance that the nomination will be completely up for grabs next July.

Pareene makes it clear he is not predicting this outcome, but is simply trying to understand why two smart pols surrounded by smart people would launch such doomed candidacies. And he’s right: neither Bloomberg nor Patrick has anything like a plausible path to the nomination via conventional means. He doesn’t really explain why anyone would think a deadlocked convention packed with delegates originally pledged to candidates who are mostly to the left of these gentlemen would turn to either of them. Perhaps Bloomberg and Patrick have more confidence in the power of the Democratic Establishment than I have; hence the alleged belief (which I do not share) that there is someone in a position to “broker” a contested convention.

But let’s just put that aside and discuss exactly how, mechanically, these candidacies would keep Democratic voters from choosing a nominee before the convention, as they have regularly done since the big switch to elected rather than appointed delegates prior to 1972.

The biggest risk of a contested convention would arise from a logjam of multiple candidates with different but relatively even bases of support who are accumulating enough delegates to make staying the course sensible. The institutional mechanism Democrats have for keeping that from happening is the 15-percent threshold for winning delegates at all (at either the statewide or congressional-district level; the precise mix varies from state to state). Additional, well-funded candidacies at this late date are likely to reduce, not increase, the odds of multiple rivals staying above 15 percent for an extended length of time, while also making it harder for some dark horse (e.g., Amy Klobuchar) to achieve viability before it’s too late.

Let’s look at some specific scenarios. Patrick will almost certainly begin his campaign with a near-exclusive focus on New Hampshire, where he is a familiar figure due to his longtime presence on Boston TV. If he does relatively well, from whom will he draw votes? Probably from Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, and the various quasi-centrist bottom-feeders in the field who may be struggling to survive by then. It’s unlikely anything other than Biden’s own mouth (and probably not even that) can knock him out of the race that early, but Mayor Pete could be in peril of heading toward extremely difficult contests in Nevada and South Carolina, mortally wounded if he underperforms in New Hampshire. But in any event, Patrick will either do so poorly that no contested convention would even begin to think of turning to him, or he’ll help winnow the field, which makes a contested convention even less likely than ever.

Bloomberg’s strategy, if he has one, is to spend giant buckets of money in the Super Tuesday states where rivals won’t have the wherewithal to compete everywhere. But again, his presence is more likely to knock a survivor or two of the early-state gauntlet below the threshold for winning delegates than to prevent the emergence of a front-runner. And let’s say Bloomberg does really well on Super Tuesday. That would likely produce a consolidation of progressive voters determined to keep an ex-Republican billionaire from buying the nomination. Assuming Sanders and Warren both remain viable after South Carolina, a Bloomberg threat could force many of their supporters to choose between them once and for all. Again, the effect might be to winnow the field and keep others from rising to viability.

I think the more realistic scenario is that Deval Patrick vanishes without a trace after New Hampshire, and Bloomberg becomes simply a giant dollar sign representing a warning to progressives that they’d better not get too carried away with their attacks on the financial sector and other wealthy pockets of “centrist” sentiment. Pareene considers and rejects the idea that either of the late entrants is in the race strictly to damage Sanders or Warren. But there’s no question that if he chose to do so, Bloomberg could go after either or both of them with the most expensive negative ad campaign in political history (along with direct attacks during candidate debates, if he can buy his way onto the stage). What would that produce? Well, either the final “struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party” that pundits long for almost as much as a “brokered convention,” or the rise of a unity candidate, who would not be named Michael Bloomberg or Deval Patrick. If Democratic elites really do think they can manipulate Democratic voters into producing a contested convention and then a coup in Milwaukee, they are about to find out how imaginary their power actually is."
167,Robert Griffin,"Theres just one problem: Those polls are likely to be exaggerating any differences in electability among the candidates.

To show this, I draw on data from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape — a weekly survey of more than 6,000 Americans. In this survey, as in most national surveys, Americans generally favor the major Democratic candidates over Trump.

For example, in the Oct. 24-30 weekly survey , those who say they are registered and intend to vote in 2020 prefer Joe Biden over Trump by 52 percent to 40 percent. Several other candidates for the Democratic nomination are also leading Trump, including Bernie Sanders (51-42), Elizabeth Warren (49-42), Pete Buttigieg (46-40), and Kamala D. Harris (46-42). These numbers haven’t changed a great deal since mid-July, when this survey project began.

If the candidates who perform better in match-ups are actually more electable, this survey suggests that Biden is most likely to defeat Trump.

AD

AD

But here’s why that is misleading: How Democratic candidates perform in these match-ups depends a lot on name recognition. While Biden and Sanders have spent considerable time on the national stage, Americans know less about other candidates.

For example, when asked whether they have a favorable or unfavorable view of these candidates, a significant number of Americans say they “haven’t heard enough” about Buttigieg (40 percent), Harris (25 percent), and Warren (18 percent). By contrast, fewer than 1 in 10 Americans say the same about Biden (9 percent) and Sanders (6 percent).

As it turns out, there is a strong negative relationship between the percentage of people saying they “haven’t heard enough” about a candidate and that candidate’s performance against Trump. In weekly data from mid-July through October, it’s clear that the better-known Democratic candidates are generally performing better than their lesser-known counterparts.

In other words, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg’s low name recognition is making them look less electable than they truly are. If their name recognition were to increase — as it certainly would if they won the Democratic nomination — polls could show that they would do as well against Trump as the candidates who are now better known.

AD

AD

Does this mean that all the candidates would do just as well if they were equally well known? Not necessarily. Biden and Sanders provide an excellent example. Despite being slightly better known, Sanders actually performs somewhat worse against Trump than Biden does. At this point in the race, Biden appears to be more electable than Sanders. This raises a question for candidates like Warren, Harris or Buttigieg: If their name recognition increased, would they look more like Biden or Sanders when matched against Trump? In each case, about a quarter of those saying they hadn’t heard enough about a candidate for the Democratic nomination also did not know how they would vote in a match-up between that candidate and Trump. In other words, these voters are doubly undecided — they don’t have an opinion of the Democratic candidate and do not have a preference between this candidate and Trump.

As a thought experiment, I looked at whether these voters had a more favorable opinion of Trump or “Democrats.” I assumed those with a more favorable opinion of Democrats would ultimately vote for the Democratic candidate once they learned more about the person. I assumed that those who had a more favorable opinion of Trump would ultimately vote for him.

This exercise increased Harris’s margin over Trump slightly (from four points to five points) but increased Buttiegieg’s margin even more (from six points to 10 points). Warren’s stayed the same (eight points). Thus at least some Democratic candidates may be more electable than they appear. At the same time, Biden retains a larger lead over Trump (12 points).

AD

AD

As the Democratic primary campaign continues, match-up polls will undoubtably continue to fuel the debate about electability. But we should take those polls with a grain of salt. Although they may reveal something about electability, they’re also exaggerating the differences among the Democratic candidates in how they would perform against Trump.

Other candidates have shown frustration in recent weeks at the rise of the 37-year-old mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city, taking aim at his relative inexperience and his struggle to attract black voters. The crowded debate stage Wednesday, featuring 10 Democratic contenders, could provide ample opportunity for that rancor to boil over.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who like Buttigieg is pitching herself as a Midwestern pragmatist, has tried to differentiate herself from him by emphasizing she is “the one from the Midwest that’s actually won in a statewide race over and over again.”

Klobuchar has also questioned whether a woman with Buttigieg’s level of experience would be enjoying the same success or attention. “Of the women on the stage . . . do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,” Klobuchar told CNN earlier this month. “Maybe we’re held to a different standard.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), meanwhile, seemed taken aback this week to learn Buttigieg had used a stock photo of a mother and child in Kenya to promote his proposal for black Americans and suggested it showed he was ill equipped to lead a diverse country.

“He’s going to have to answer for that,” Harris said after laughing. “The Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are as the diversity of the American people.”



The Buttigieg campaign declined to comment for this article, though his senior communications adviser hinted that his advisers were expecting Buttigieg to be a debate target. She tweeted a “Game of Thrones” image of Jon Snow, one of the saga’s heroes, fending off an onslaught of attackers.

The South Bend mayor entered the race as a little-known figure, but he recently surged to first place in a poll of Iowa voters and has been rising in New Hampshire.

Wednesday’s debate, sponsored by The Washington Post and MSNBC, comes at a turbulent political moment as the capital is consumed with impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The Democratic race itself remains fluid, with several candidates dropping out in recent months and others making last-minute entries, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and potentially former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.

That murkiness has some Democratic donors and strategists fretting that the primary could languish for months with no clear winner. So far, Democrats have engaged in a game of shoot the leader: First Biden, then Harris, then Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have seen surges of momentum, only to attract sharp attacks from their rivals on the debate stage.

AD

It is unclear whether Warren will join any such verbal assaults on Buttigieg on Wednesday. For weeks, the mayor has been running ads that criticize Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for their embrace of a Medicare-for-all health plan, and he has denigrated Warren’s position as “my way or the highway.”

AD

Buttigieg leveled some of the sharpest attacks on Warren in the last debate. Warren’s style has been to avoid directly criticizing Buttigieg — or the other Democrats — but she recently sharpened her stump speech to criticize candidates who take corporate donations and offer proposals that “nibble around the edges.”

“I’m not running some consultant-driven campaign with proposals that have been carefully crafted not to offend big donors,” Warren said at a town hall in North Las Vegas on Sunday, in a comment seen by many as a shot at Buttigieg. “I passed that point a long time ago.”

AD

She added that the Democratic nominee needed “big ideas” to inspire voters and to help those who need it most. Buttigieg, like Biden, has proposed a government-run health plan as an option, rather than making it universal and mandatory, as under Medicare-for-all.

AD

“I get it. It’s easy to give up on big ideas. You can make yourself so smart and so sophisticated,” Warren said. “But here’s the thing: When we give up on those big ideas, we give up on the people who would be touched by those ideas.”

Biden, who has been slipping in the Iowa polls, has mostly used a light touch in dealing with Buttigieg, though he has tried to take back the phrase “Medicare for all who want it” — first used by Buttigieg’s campaign — as an approach he came up with first.

AD

Biden will have to decide whether to go further than that Wednesday. A Biden supporter this week circulated video of Buttigieg speaking at a tea party event in 2010, expressing the possibility of finding common ground with the deeply conservative group as he campaigned for Indiana state treasurer. The tea party is anathema to many Democratic voters.

AD

Though Buttigieg has not directly attacked Biden, he has unmistakably presented himself as an alternative to the former vice president in courting the Democratic Party’s centrist wing, and at times he has referred to “the failures of the old normal.”

Buttigieg may be most vulnerable Wednesday on issues of race. He comes into the debate fresh from a controversy in which his campaign touted the backing of more than 400 South Carolinians for his “Douglass Plan for Black Americans,” even if they did not endorse Buttigieg himself. That led some signatories to feel their positions had been misrepresented.

AD

Last week, Johnnie Cordero, chairman of the Democratic Black Caucus of South Carolina, told the Intercept that the Buttigieg campaign had used his name prominently even though he had not endorsed the plan. Two other black leaders also expressed reservations about how the campaign had characterized their support.

AD

For days, the campaign insisted it had done nothing wrong, but on Monday, Buttigieg called the incident a “miscommunication” and a “learning experience,” according to NBC News.

“We have a lot of people who are supporting [the Douglass Plan] but a few people who didn’t believe the message reflected their support,” Buttigieg said. “So we are clearing that up.”

AD

Meanwhile, it also emerged that Buttigieg’s campaign had used a stock photo of a woman and child in Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan; the campaign said the images have since been removed from its website and apologized for their inclusion.

On Monday, Harris responded forcefully when reporters asked her to weigh in on the controversy, after initially seeming surprised. “I’m sure someone agrees that was a big mistake,” Harris said. “He’s going to have to answer for that. It’s — I don’t have words to describe that.”

AD

In his continued efforts to court black voters, Buttigieg on Monday addressed an audience made up largely of students from historically black Morehouse and Spelman colleges in Atlanta. He cited former Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and her work on voting rights, while facing questions about the fallout in South Bend when a white police officer shot a black resident earlier this year.

Buttigieg was light on details, often answering with phrases like “There’s no easy fix for that” or “We’re not going to solve it all today.”

That left Spelman freshman Kyra Gines wanting more, especially when it comes to details of the Douglass Plan.

“I think he’s good at being a politician,” Gines said. “He knew his audience well, and he knew the buzz lines that would do well . . . . In terms of actual content, I think there were some things to be desired in how he stepped around questions. But again, that’s politicians.”

Even candidates who failed to qualify for the debate stage have joined in the criticism of Buttigieg, sometimes expressing disbelief that a candidate with such a short resume has pushed them out of the spotlight.

At a Friday house party in Nashua, N.H., Colorado Sen. Michael F. Bennet joked about South Bend’s small size.

“The school district that I ran had a budget three times the size of South Bend, which is substantial,” said Bennet, who once headed Denver’s school district. “I’ve won two national elections in a swing state. I won more votes than any politician has ever won in the state of Colorado, the last time I ran.”

He added, “Mayor Pete won eight thousand votes the last time he ran for mayor. I’m not denigrating it, but it’s a very different set of experiences.”"

Pete Buttigieg is polling incredibly well in Iowa. And the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did nearly everything possible during the fifth Democratic debate to try to boost his support even more in the big corn-growing state -- by repeatedly hammering how farmers can be part of the solution to climate change.

Buttigieg spent much of Wednesday evening honing an environmental message designed to cast farmers as a key group in battling climate change, more than perhaps any other candidate on stage during the debate hosted by The Washington Post and MSNBC in Atlanta.

""American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change,"" Buttigieg said. That message, he added, is a good way of recruiting ""everybody to be part of the solution, including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging they're part of the problem.""

This message may resonate in nation's first state to vote in the Democratic primary: A recent Des Moines Register-CNN poll showed Buttigieg surging with support from 25 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden all behind the small city mayor in essentially a three-way tie at about 15 percent support.

When asked about President Trump's subsidies to farmers amid a trade war with China, Buttigieg pivoted to a part of his $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion climate plan to support farmers and ranchers in adopting management techniques that capture carbon dioxide from the air.

""I believe that the quest for the carbon-negative farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country,"" Buttigieg said during the debate.

Buttigieg also called out Trump for exempting dozens of oil refineries from having to blend biofuels — notably, corn-based ethanol — into their gasoline. Renewable fuel policy means little outside the nation's Corn Belt, but it is perennially a high-priority issue in Iowa, which grows more corn than any other state.

""Look, I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers,"" Buttigieg said.

Like many other Midwestern states earlier this year, Iowa was hit with catastrophic floods of the sort which will become more frequent and severe as the world continues to warm.

In the past, Buttigieg has made that connection when campaigning in Iowa. ""Rural communities — from river towns to tribal lands to farms — are on the front lines of climate change,"" the candidate wrote in an op-ed in August in the Des Moines Register, the state's largest newspaper. ""Yet too often, rural Americans are told they’re part of the problem.""

Buttigieg's momentum in Iowa, as well as in New Hampshire where polling also shows him up, put a target on his back during the debate. But Buttigieg escaped unscathed. His biggest tussle of the night was with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). ""That’s about the best he could have hoped for, given her limited constituency in the Democratic Party,"" writes The Post's Aaron Blake.

Here are some of the other climate-related moments from the debate:

Tom Steyer: The billionaire financier tried to cast himself as the ""climate candidate"" on stage (a la former presidential contender and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee), and claimed he was the only candidate to support declaring a state of emergency to address climate change. ""I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the No. 1 priority for me,"" he said. ""Vice President Biden won't say it."" But Sanders shot back that he too has put forward legislation calling for the use of emergency powers.

— Energy Department disputes Sondland testimony: The Energy Department put out a statement pushing back on remarks U.S. ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland ​made before the House Intelligence Committee. During that blockbuster testimony, Sondland suggested Energy Secretary Rick Perry was familiar with efforts to put pressure on Ukraine for investigations into Trump's political opponents.

What Sondland said: He testified that he informed a number of top administration officials, including Perry, that the Ukrainian president would comply with Trump’s request for an investigation of the Ukrainian gas company where Joe Biden’s son was a member of the board. Sondland said he emailed officials, including Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, the week before a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — an email Sondland says Perry replied to.

The National Weather Service predicted that the critical fire conditions will continue into part of Thursday. “Stay tuned — fire season is definitely not over yet until the region receives widespread wetting rainfall,” it warned. It's the fourth round of these blackouts in two months: ""PG&E Co. began shutting off power Wednesday morning in Napa and Sonoma counties, including parts of the city of Santa Rosa, where the Tubbs Fire in 2017 killed 22 people and destroyed over 5,000 structures,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “The blackouts will eventually affect around 150,000 customers in 18 counties, extending as far north as Shasta County and as far south as Solano County, a distance of over 200 miles.”

— Newsom imposes a temporary fracking ban in California: In the state’s latest move away from fossil fuels, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has halted the approval of all pending fracking in the state until there can be an independent review of the projects, the Los Angeles Times reports. The governor also halted approvals of oil extraction wells that use high-pressure steam, a method that’s been opposed by environmentalists. “These are necessary steps to strengthen oversight of oil and gas extraction as we phase out our dependence on fossil fuels and focus on clean energy sources,” Newsom said in a statement.

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: Amy Klobuchar questioned last week whether a woman with Pete Buttigieg’s level of experience would be on a presidential debate stage. With the two Democratic candidates standing on such a stage last night in Atlanta, NBC’s Andrea Mitchell tried to tee up fireworks between the senior senator from Minnesota and the mayor of South Bend, Ind. But Klobuchar took a pass.

“Pete is qualified to be up on this stage, and I am honored to be standing next to him,” she responded. “But what I said is true. Women are held to a higher standard. Otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite female president, which we can’t do because it has all been men.”

Then Klobuchar delivered the most memorable line of the night. “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump,” she said, “Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.”

The crowd roared, and Buttigieg wasn’t asked to respond. It was a great moment for Klobuchar, who has struggled to translate impressive debate performances into grass-roots support, but her answer also spared a relatively untested candidate who has surged in the polls from what could have become a quite uncomfortable back-and-forth. Buttigieg, an openly gay white man, is seeking to become the standard-bearer of a diverse party whose most vocal activists have increasingly embraced identity politics.

The 37-year-old prepared for a barrage of intense attacks that didn’t materialize in the debate, which was hosted by The Washington Post and MSNBC. But now the presidential race will move to the backburner for the next few weeks as the national media, and many undecided Democratic voters, turn their focus back to the impeachment proceedings in Washington. The next debate doesn’t take place until Dec. 19 in Los Angeles.

A similar dynamic played out with Kamala Harris. On Monday, she criticized Buttigieg for using a stock photo of a mother and child from Kenya to promote his proposal for helping black Americans. She called it a “big mistake” that suggested he’s not ready to lead our polyglot republic. “I don’t have words to describe that,” Harris said. Another moderator, NBC’s Kristen Welker, brought up the topic and tried to get Harris to say more. But the junior senator from California declined. She said Buttigieg has apologized for the error, essentially letting him off the hook, and quickly pivoted to talk about her own plans to help black women.

And so it went. Buttigieg has been eating Joe Biden’s lunch in Iowa, yet the former vice president chose not to come after him. Cory Booker, plainly jealous that Buttigieg has seized the mantle of generational change that he hoped to carry in 2020, noted at one point during the debate that he too was a Rhodes Scholar and previously served as a mayor of Newark before representing New Jersey in the Senate. In a subtle dig, Booker mentioned that he led “the largest city in my state.” (South Bend is the fourth-most-populous city in Indiana.)

-- The only candidate who decided to really go after Buttigieg in an aggressive way was Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, perhaps the most useful possible foil for Buttigieg who was onstage. She claimed that he wants to send U.S. troops to fight drug cartels in Mexico. “That is outlandish,” Buttigieg replied. He accused her of taking him out of context. Then he attacked Gabbard for visiting Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, which he cited as proof of her poor judgment.

Earlier in the debate, after Gabbard criticized the Democratic Party for being overly interventionist, Harris ripped her for palling around with Assad and trekking to Trump Tower during the transition for a meeting with Steve Bannon amid speculation she might land a Cabinet appointment. “I think that it’s unfortunate that we have someone on the stage … who during the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,” Harris said. This laid the groundwork for Buttigieg’s clapback more than an hour later.

-- The debate underscored just how fluid the race remains. No one dominated this debate, including Buttigieg. The clashes were less ideological than before and more focused on electability. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick have taken steps to join the field because Biden has been a weaker candidate than they expected. The race has already been frozen in some important respects by the impeachment inquiry, making it harder for candidates to unveil new plans or to generate coverage for talking about anything other than President Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.

A Des Moines Register poll released over the weekend showed Buttigieg capturing the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, followed by essentially a three-way tie for second place between Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who all drew 15 percent. None of the other candidates are in double digits. But most voters say they’re not wedded to anyone. A more surprising Saint Anselm College poll released this week put Buttigieg up 10 points among likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire, as well, with 25 percent to 15 percent for both Warren and Biden, albeit with a smaller sample size.

-- Every candidate has distinct incentives with 75 days to go until Iowa caucuses. Because the field is so scattered, Warren, Sanders and Biden seemed more focused on promoting themselves than attacking anyone else. The senior senator from Massachusetts was barely attacked last night, certainly compared to last month’s debate, possibly because her rivals see her as wounded. Some wind has been coming out of her sails as she’s struggled to detail how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

Biden, celebrating his 77th birthday, struggled once again to deliver a decisive performance. One illustration of just how unsettled the race remains came when billionaire Tom Steyer accused Biden of not taking climate change seriously enough. The former vice president slammed Steyer for making millions off coal at a time when he was championing environmental legislation in the Senate. If Biden was more confident about his standing, he might have brushed off Steyer – a non-factor in this race – and merely touted his own record or plans for rejoining the Paris climate accord.

-- Even though Harris didn’t attack him on Wednesday night, Buttigieg has failed thus far to make inroads with African Americans, a struggle that continues to cast a cloud over the long-term viability of his candidacy. Despite those polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, two of the whitest states in the country, Quinnipiac University’s new South Carolina survey shows Buttigieg garnering less than one percent support among black voters – raising new questions about whether he can go the distance when the nominating contest moves to the South and, if he’s the nominee, whether he’ll be able to re-activate black voters who backed Barack Obama twice but stayed home when Hillary Clinton was on the ballot in 2016.

Buttigieg watched his words carefully, but he referred to being openly gay as he discussed racism. “While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,” he said.

Last night, though, no one mentioned the police shooting in his city that dogged him during a previous debate. But Buttigieg touted his stewardship of South Bend. “I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me – and before I share what's in my plans, let me talk about what's in my heart and why this is so important,” he said. “As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low-income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.”

Booker went after Biden, not Buttigieg, on the black vote. Perhaps because Biden actually has black support. He criticized Biden’s comments from the weekend about the dangers of legalizing marijuana as an example of how he doesn’t understand the issues affecting people of color. “I thought you might’ve been high when you said it,” Booker quipped. Biden said he wants to decriminalize marijuana. Biden then touted his support from the black community, but he mistakenly claimed that “the only black African American woman who had ever been elected to the United States Senate” supported him. “That’s not true,” Harris declared. Biden corrected himself to say that he meant “the first” black female senator supported him.

-- Buttigieg was pressed harder by the moderators than his rivals on his relative lack of governing experience. The mayor is wrapping up his second term as the chief executive of a city with just over 100,000 residents. Mitchell noted that Buttigieg was elected mayor with fewer than 11,000 votes, and he lost by 25 points when he ran for state treasurer. He also finished third in the race to chair the Democratic National Committee just last year. “Why,” Mitchell wondered, “should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he answered. “In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he's been appealing to.” Buttigieg boasted that a recent Forbes magazine list showed he’s “literally the least wealthy person on this stage.”

-- Buttigieg wants to position himself as the leading outsider candidate in the race, noting that his opponents onstage have served in Washington cumulatively for more than 100 years. The ongoing impeachment drama will give him an opportunity to sharpen this message, but that may resonate more in the context of a general election than a primary. Five of the 10 candidates onstage were senators who would be jurors in any impeachment trial. A sixth senator, Michael Bennet of Colorado, didn’t qualify for the debate but continues to essentially camp out in New Hampshire as he tries to make some magic happen.

The conventional wisdom among the chattering classes – and across most of the campaigns – is that the trial could become a frustrating distraction that keeps the senators away from Iowa and New Hampshire on the eve of voting. Perhaps that might become a problem if the trial really drags on. But it’s also possible that these races have become so nationalized – even in the early states – that all eyes would be on whatever’s happening in the Senate. And the six senators could get a helpful platform to showcase how they’re standing up to Trump, which is undoubtedly helpful in the context of a primary. In that way, it feels like an impeachment trial could become very beneficial for lower-tier candidates like Harris and Booker who are struggling to catch a break.

“I know that from the perspective of Washington what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small,” Buttigieg said. “The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small. And I believe we need to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience.”

THE LATEST ON IMPEACHMENT:

-- Fiona Hill, the former White House adviser on Russia, opened her testimony before the impeachment inquiry this morning with withering criticism of Republican attempts to sow doubt that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Hill’s testimony sets the stage for an extraordinary development in the impeachment hearings, with Trump’s former top adviser on Russia essentially telling the public under oath that his refusal to accept the reality of Moscow’s intervention in 2016 is wrong,” Greg Miller reports.

“This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services,” Hill said in her opening statement. “Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country. … The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions. It is beyond dispute.”

-- In the most damaging testimony yet for Trump, U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland said yesterday that there was a quid pro quo “with regard” to Ukraine. He explicitly linked the president, the vice president and other senior officials to what he described as a widely understood campaign to pressure a foreign government to investigate Joe Biden. Rachael Bade, Aaron C. Davis and Matt Zapotosky report: “More forcefully than he has before, Sondland declared that the Trump administration would not give Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a chance to visit the White House — unless Zelensky agreed to announce investigations that could help the president politically. ‘I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?’ Sondland said. ‘With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.’ …

“Sondland acknowledged that he and others were the ones pushing Ukrainians to announce investigations, but asserted they had merely ‘followed the president’s orders,’ communicated through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Sondland testified that top-level officials — including [Vice President] Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — were made aware at various points of what was happening, and he provided emails to back up his assertions. ‘Everyone,’ Sondland testified, ‘was in the loop.’ …

""In his defense, Trump zeroed in on one favorable, but misleading, part of how Sondland described a September phone call between the two. Sondland at the time had just received a text message from the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, worried that the White House was conditioning nearly $400 million in aid on the country committing to the investigations targeting Democrats. Sondland later replied in a text message … that the president wanted ‘no quid pro quo’s of any kind.’ Sondland testified last month, and again on Wednesday, that the phrase came directly from Trump in a phone call before he sent the text. … ‘I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,’ Sondland recalled Trump saying in the phone call. Trump carried with him handwritten notes of Sondland’s words as he spoke to reporters outside the White House. … Sondland testified Wednesday that he wished he’d typed the text differently back in September, using quotation marks to make clear the no quid pro quo phrase had come from Trump. It was ‘not artfully written,’ he said. …

“Sondland said that he, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Kurt Volker, at the time a special envoy to Ukraine, worked with Giuliani in pressing Ukraine ‘at the express direction of the president of the United States’ — even though they were reluctant to do so. At least initially, though, Sondland said he did not believe he was engaging in anything ‘improper’ — in part because he claimed he did not understand that Trump wanted an investigation of Biden. Other witnesses have disputed that account. … Sondland said Giuliani seemed more focused on getting Ukraine to publicly reveal the investigations, rather than actually carry them out, though he conceded official announcements would hold foreign officials to their word. … Sondland revealed an email showing that he asked Pompeo to help him orchestrate a face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelensky, off to the side of a World War II commemoration ceremony that the two were scheduled to attend in Poland on Sept. 1. … Days later, Trump decided not to travel to Warsaw ... Pence made the trip in place of Trump. Sondland claimed he informed the vice president before the meeting ‘that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations.’” (Pence's chief of staff denies that this happened.)

-- Sondland’s testimony left Trump’s Republican allies scrambling. Seung Min Kim, Josh Dawsey and Kayla Epstein report: “As he traveled on Air Force One to Texas, Trump called members of the House to argue that the testimony was good for him, according to an aide ... Trump also professed to reporters that he had little familiarity with Sondland, a major donor to his inauguration who testified that he had spoken with the president about 20 times. … On Sondland, key Republican allies sought to undermine the ambassador’s credibility, while insisting that the basic facts had not changed as to whether Trump had committed an impeachable offense by pressuring Ukraine to investigate [the Bidens]. ‘I say that he’s changed his story several times and one needs to be suspicious of that. But having said that, take what he says, compare it to the facts,’ Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday of Sondland. ‘I just know this: That [Ukraine] got the money, and Hunter Biden and Joe Biden weren’t investigated. That’s what I do know.’ … ‘Mike Turner’s ability to get Ambassador Sondland to say that he had not heard from anyone in the administration that would suggest that aid was tied to any investigations was really powerful and compelling,’ said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s most ardent defenders in the House. ...

“The White House sent 14 different sections of talking points to congressional Republicans, coming in at more than 3,300 words ... Included was a list of 10 times Sondland said he believed or presumed information to be true but could not prove it. … Other Trump allies sought to argue that, even if there was a quid pro quo as Sondland had testified, there were other factors to consider. ‘I don’t think the quid pro quo is the issue. If you’re talking about an illegal quid pro quo, there are legal and illegal quid pro quos,’ said Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.). ‘And an illegal quid pro would be based on a president’s intent.’ … White House aides said Sondland was the most damaging witness so far because he actually had interactions with Trump and described key issues in nefarious terms.""

-- Sondland appeared to embrace his role in history with nonchalance. Aaron C. Davis, Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey report: “As Sondland warmed up, sometimes smirking, joking and announcing casually that, yes, there had been a quid pro quo, it soon wasn’t clear what gravity he saw in the moment. … There was no somber rhetoric, no cancer on the presidency in his eyes — but rather a businessman for a president who had a transactional issue to solve: Trump wanted certain things from Ukraine, and vice versa. ‘Look,’ Sondland said, ‘we tried to fix the problem.’ … At some points, he even appeared to be having a good time. Asked about a phone call in which he was overheard giving Trump an encouraging report about the pressure campaign, Sondland seemed amused when read back an account of having told Trump that the president of Ukraine ‘loves your ass.’ ‘Sounds like something I would say,’ Sondland quipped. ‘That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words.’ Republicans took turns reading statements issued by [Perry] and Pence challenging Sondland’s testimony in near-real time. The ambassador sat still, smiling slightly, seemingly unfazed. At one point earlier this fall, Trump had praised Sondland as ‘a great American.’ On Wednesday, a lawmaker read Sondland the latest presidential comment: ‘This is not a man I know well.’ Sondland seemed unperturbed, saying with a chuckle, ‘Easy come, easy go.’”

-- By providing the committee with emails showing top administration officials were personally aware of or directly involved in the alleged quid pro quo, Sondland validated many Democratic suspicions. He also highlighted how much evidence has not been turned over, which gives Democrats usable evidence to substantiate a likely article of impeachment based on obstruction. Karoun Demirjian reports: “‘Based on a sample of the documents attached to Ambassador Sondland’s statement . . . we can see why Pompeo and [Trump] have made such a concerted and across-the-board effort to obstruct this investigation,’ Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said at Wednesday’s hearing. ‘They do so at their own peril: I remind the president that Article III of the impeachment articles drafted against President Nixon was his refusal to obey the subpoenas of Congress.’ …

""Sondland’s revelations implicated senior members of the Trump administration, and he made clear there are emails, phone records and documents that could have a bearing on the House impeachment investigation. But it is not clear whether House Democrats will run down all the new leads, as doing so would likely require them to issue new subpoenas and double down on existing ones in the courts. Democrats have repeatedly expressed a reluctance to get bogged down in legal proceedings, and leaders are committed to not losing the momentum of the public impeachment hearings, which are on course to feature a dozen witnesses in less than two weeks. Senior Democrats have indicated that the House is on track to vote on impeachment next month. Yet several members have acknowledged that there could be value in securing the testimony of holdouts like Pompeo and [Bolton], neither of whom have yet been subpoenaed for testimony.”

-- Sondland’s dramatic testimony undercut the president's version of events, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “He arrived for Wednesday’s hearing facing an obvious dilemma, which was to risk a charge of lying to Congress by significantly disputing testimony that had taken place after his prior statements, or openly disputing the president’s version of events and thereby risking the wrath of the president’s allies as well as many with whom he serves in the administration. He chose to take on the president.”

-- Trump told Sondland there was “no quid pro quo” on Sept. 9. That's the same day the whistleblower complaint was filed, after several White House staffers expressed alarm to the National Security Council’s top lawyer, after the CIA general counsel was alerted to concerns by an employee of the agency and after multiple lawmakers, including Republican senators, inquired about why the aid was being held up.

Sondland said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump emphatically said there was “no quid pro quo” only because the president had already learned about the complaint. “He was in a very bad mood,” Sondland said during his closed-door deposition last month. “It was a very quick conversation.”

-- If Sondland was an agent of Trump’s alleged plot, he portrayed himself as a reluctant one, writes the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser: “By 10:15 a.m., when Sondland finished reading out his twenty-three-page opening statement, it was all over but the shouting, of which there would be much over the next seven hours. But that was later. For nearly forty-five minutes, the impeachment hearings were compelling enough to bring the relentless Washington news cycle to a halt, at least temporarily. There was no hate-tweeting from the Oval Office, no spin in the corridors of Capitol Hill. Just people listening, watching, wondering what it would mean.”

-- Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine, amended her testimony last night. She says her staff alerted her after her first deposition that they received an inquiry from the Ukrainian embassy about the status of the military aid frozen by Trump on July 25, just hours after the president's call with Zelensky. ""The new timeline Cooper laid out threatens one of the GOP’s main defenses of Trump — that the Ukranians were not aware of the hold on security aid at the time of the call between the heads of state, and that they found nothing alarming in the presidents’ discussion,"" Felicia Sonmez, John Wagner and Colby Itkowitz report. The White House challenged Cooper’s timeline, arguing that just because the Ukrainians asked does not mean they knew that Trump had frozen the money.

Lawmakers also heard last night from David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs. Hale, the third-highest-ranking official at the State Department, shed more light on the dismissal of Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine: “‘I believe she should have been able to stay at the post and continue to do the outstanding work,’ Hale testified about Yovanovitch. Asked by Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) whether ‘what happened to her was wrong,’ Hale responded, ‘That’s right.’” Hale, who was called to testify by Republicans, also said he believed it would be unusual to withhold military aid to pressure a country to investigate a political opponent: “

-- The timeline has remained somewhat murky. Philip Bump sketched out what we know so far about it.

--The Fix prepared a list of things that Trump, Pence, Pompeo and other senior officials knew, based on Sondland’s testimony, texts and emails.

-- The FBI is seeking an interview with the whistleblower, who works for the CIA. Ellen Nakashima and Devlin Barrett report: “A special agent with the bureau’s Washington Field Office contacted one of the whistleblower’s lawyers last month, and the FBI and the legal team have traded messages since … No date for an interview has been set, and it is not clear whether one will be … The FBI is interested in the ‘substance’ of the whistleblower’s complaint, said one person familiar with the matter. … The bureau does not appear to be pursuing a leak investigation … It is unclear precisely what the FBI is investigating in its request to question the whistleblower, or whether it did so with the approval of Justice Department officials.”

-- Federal prosecutors in Manhattan issued subpoenas in recent weeks to Trump fundraisers linked to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the two indicted Giuliani associates. From the Times: “The subpoenas went to a lobbying firm run by a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump, Brian Ballard, and to two people who have helped raise money for America First Action, a super PAC created to support the president and allied candidates ... Mr. Ballard and the America First fund-raisers worked to varying extents with [Parnas and Fruman] … Prosecutors also arranged a voluntary interview in New York as soon as this week with Andrew Favorov, an executive with the Ukrainian state-owned gas company Naftogaz whom Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman tried to enlist in an effort to win business, potentially through Global Energy Producers.”

-- Parnas, an indicted Giuliani associate, helped arrange meetings and calls in Europe last year for Rep. Devin Nunes, Parnas’s attorney told The Daily Beast: “Nunes aide Derek Harvey participated in the meetings, the lawyer said, which were arranged to help Nunes’ investigative work. … The travel came as Nunes, in his role on the House Intelligence Committee, was working to investigate the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election-meddling. Parnas’ assistance to Nunes’ team has not been previously reported. A spokesperson for Nunes did not respond to requests for comment.”

-- Trump is aggressively courting some of his Republican critics – including Mitt Romney -- ahead of a likely Senate trial. From Politico: “By day's end, the president will have hosted more than 40 Republican senators at the White House since autumn began, mostly for weekly lunches that address a series of issues but also usually include a side of impeachment. ... Romney has said it would be ‘wrong and appalling’ for Trump to request foreign countries to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, prompting Trump to call Romney a ‘pompous ass.’ But the Utah Republican seemed to be keeping an open mind heading into the meeting, even if impeachment comes up. ‘It’s the president’s meeting. Whatever he wants to talk about, he can talk about,’ Romney said. ‘I wasn’t expecting an invitation, but I’m happy to hear what the president wants to talk about.’”

-- Life at the impeachment “kids table” for new committee members sometimes means waiting hours for the spotlight. Paul Kane reports: “All told, six members, four Democrats and two Republicans, are new to the panel, but only [Jordan], installed this month by GOP leaders wary of the performance by their senior committee members, has a prime seat. These are the lawmakers who have to wait, wondering whether their preferred topic will already be covered by someone with an earlier spot. That’s a normal tradition in any committee in Congress, but these stakes could not be higher, with cable news networks covering every single question late into the evening. In addition, special rules for this inquiry gave the chairman and the ranking member a combined 90 minutes of questions at the top of the hearings, leaving members of this ‘kids table’ stewing sometimes for four or five hours before getting a word in edgewise.”

-- New York Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D) will become the next chairwoman of the Oversight and Reform Committee. She succeeds the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). Mike DeBonis reports: “As the most senior member of the panel, Maloney has been serving as acting chairman since [Cummings’s death]. But she faced a challenge from Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (Va.), who argued to his colleagues that he was better equipped to handle the rigors of impeachment and battling Republicans intent on protecting the Trump administration from scrutiny. In the end, Democrats chose to respect seniority, electing Maloney on a 133-86 vote. … As the most senior member on the Oversight panel, Maloney got a boost from key sectors of the Democratic caucus that prize the seniority system — including the 53-member Congressional Black Caucus. … Also playing to Maloney’s advantage were diversity concerns: Maloney is the only woman among the three committee chairs who have taken a lead role in the impeachment inquiry.”

-- Commentary from the opinion page:

-- On the coverage: As Sondland testified, a misleading Ukraine story quickly spread among conservatives on social media. From NBC News: “The incorrect story, first disseminated by the finance blog ZeroHedge, claimed that Mykola Zlochevsky, the head of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, had been indicted over money laundering related to the Biden family. … In fact, there was no announcement of an indictment. Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, announced in October his office would conduct a wide-ranging review of all previous cases involving Burisma, and Wednesday said he was including possible embezzlement in the investigation, according to Reuters.”

-- Lawyers for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman sent a letter to Fox News asking the network to retract a “false and defamatory” segment that suggested the National Security Council’s Ukraine expert committed espionage. From CNN: “The request for a retraction centers around an October 28 segment on Laura Ingraham's prime time show, ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ During that segment, Ingraham seemed to suggest Vindman, a decorated military officer, was perhaps more loyal to Ukraine than the United States. Vindman was born in Ukraine but grew up in the US. ‘Isn't that kind of an interesting angle on this story?’ Ingraham asked her guest John Yoo, a law professor who served in President George W. Bush's administration. ‘I find that astounding,’ Yoo replied. ‘Some people might call that espionage.’ Vindman's attorney, David Pressman, characterized the segment in his letter as ‘false and defamatory’ and ‘deeply flawed and erroneous,’ noting espionage is punishable by death. ... A Fox News spokesperson pointed to Yoo's clarifications when asked for comment on Pressman's letter to the network. ‘As a guest on Fox News, John Yoo was responsible for his own sentiments and he has subsequently done interviews to clarify what he meant,’ the Fox News spokesperson said.""

THE TRUMP AGENDA THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Trump health-care adviser Seema Verma spent $3.3 million of taxpayer money to hire a stable of high-priced image consultants, who tried to get magazines like Glamour to profile her and encouraged Verma to go to social events to boost her personal brand. Amy Goldstein reports on what would almost certainly have been a massive scandal in any past administration: “Earlier this year, a top Republican communications operative delivered a plan to boost the profile of ... Trump’s top appointee overseeing health insurance for the elderly and poor. The 'Executive Visibility Proposal' was a month-by-month blueprint to have her grant interviews to Women’s Day and other magazines, speak at prominent conferences and appear at Washington’s most prestigious social events. ... This work over 19 months that provided ‘strategic communication’ services by a network of politically connected contractors and subcontractors, first reported by Politico, came as Verma spoke about the importance of fostering individual responsibility and self-reliance among the nation’s needy. As chief of [the] Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services, Verma has forged a far more partisan and outspoken brand than almost any of her predecessors. Typically, CMS administrators are visible on Capitol Hill and elsewhere but focus on the wonkish details of public insurance programs. Verma, in contrast, has emerged as one of the administration’s champions of conservative health policies …

""Offstage but irksome to some CMS staffers, the strategic communications consultants— at least two dozen of them, documents show — formed an extragovernmental team that helped guide Verma where she wanted to go politically, oversaw some decisions by communication staff and attempted to elevate her profile in ways that go beyond what federal consultants usually are hired to do — and possibly beyond what contracting law permits, according to the documents, individuals familiar with the team’s role and an expert on government ethics. ... HHS ordered an end to the contract, and work stopped the evening of April 3, after Politico first disclosed the contours of the arrangement. Afterward, Verma told multiple people that she wanted the contract restarted … HHS’s Office of Inspector General has been conducting a review of the contracts and the contractors’ role since June, and an office spokeswoman said it expects to finish early next year. ...

“The main contract was with Porter Novelli, a multinational public relations firm based in Washington. Some of the work was carried out under a subcontract to another firm, Nahigian Strategies, led by two brothers with strong GOP ties … Both of them billed at $380 an hour … At one point, CMS asked HHS to approve a multimillion-dollar contract for a national bus tour for Verma that was organized by Nahigian Strategies, but then decided not to move forward with it … Still, the Nahigian brothers and their employees continued to work as advance staff for Verma’s out-of-town appearances — a role that does not typically exist for federal officials below the level of Cabinet secretaries but was important to Verma.” Verma’s spokesman said that, of the recommended magazines and news outlets that consultants thought could write about her, only AARP and Politico did. Sounds like a not-very-good return on investment.

-- Barry Myers, the White House’s pick to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has withdrawn from consideration due to health concerns. Andrew Freedman and Jason Samenow report: “Myers’ nomination had languished in the Senate since it was first announced in November 2017, due in part to conflict of interest concerns regarding his family’s continued ownership stake in AccuWeather, the private weather forecasting company he led until stepping down on Jan. 1. … Before his nomination, Myers had served as the CEO of AccuWeather since 2007. AccuWeather has had a history of advocating for expanding the role of private forecasting companies at the expense of the taxpayer-funded National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA. Concerns had also been raised regarding AccuWeather’s record of sexual harassment lawsuits and settlements during Myers’ time at the company. … Myers’ nomination had twice been favorably reported out of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, but was never brought up for a floor vote.”

-- Fox News television personality Pete Hegseth, who convinced Trump to pardon disgraced service members charged in war crimes cases, has also been tapped by for-profit colleges to defend a lucrative loophole. From ProPublica: “Under the law, for-profit colleges can’t receive more than 90% of their revenue from federal education funds. The logic, according to the staffer who drafted the provision, was that the education should be good enough that at least some students are willing to pay. But veterans’ benefits, such as GI Bill stipends, don’t count as federal education funds (even though they also come from the federal government). This ‘90/10 loophole’ means that for every veteran enrolled, a school can admit nine more students using federal loans. Veterans advocates and congressional investigators say this loophole leads to predatory and deceptive marketing tactics that sometimes leave veterans with unexpected debt and useless degrees if schools lose their accreditation or go out of business.”

-- Trump hosted Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, the pro-Trump billioniare who sits on the company's board, for a secret dinner at the White House last month. From NBC News: “Facebook confirmed the meeting ... on Wednesday. ... It is unclear why the meeting was not made public or what Trump, Zuckerberg and Thiel discussed.”

-- So swampy: Dozens of Facebook lobbyists are tied to members of Congress, a new investigation shows. From the Guardian: “So far this year, Facebook has employed 68 federal lobbyists, 12 in-house employees and 56 from K Street firms – spending nearly $12.3m on federal lobbying through 30 September. … The Facebook lobbyists have worked for 29 current members of Congress – 18 representatives and 11 senators – including key Democratic party leaders. Four of the lobbyists have worked in the office of [Pelosi]. Two have worked in the office of Hakeem Jeffries, chair of the House Democratic Caucus. Other Facebook lobbyists have worked for the majority leader Steny Hoyer, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Mark Warner, who is vice chair of the chamber’s Democratic caucus, and [Klobuchar]. Some of these lobbyists have recently donated to their former bosses … Thirty-two Facebook lobbyists worked for Democratic members of Congress, Democratic White Houses, or were hired by Democrats to serve as committee staffers, and 30 more worked for Republicans. In contrast to the Democratic connections, no 2019 Facebook lobbyist has worked for current members of the Republican House and Senate leadership. However, several have worked for powerful GOP Senate committee chairmen.”

-- The Trump administration has secretly begun carrying out its plan to deport people seeking asylum from the U.S. to Guatemala without giving them a chance to see a lawyer first. From BuzzFeed News: “Two sources with knowledge of the process and emailed guidance sent to asylum officials ... reveal new details of the 'third country' agreement — including a crucial part of the process where asylum-seekers are not entitled to a lawyer. … [USCIS] officials emailed guidance to asylum officers across the country on Wednesday morning to notify them that implementation of the plan would begin … The first phase of the plan will take place in El Paso. Border officials will, on an expected daily basis, refer a small number of adult asylum-seekers from El Salvador and Honduras who arrived on or after Tuesday to asylum officers for interviews, according to two sources with knowledge of the process. A few dozen asylum officers who had already been trained on the process will handle the interviews. … Before this interview with an asylum officer, immigrants have no access to legal counsel — unlike their initial asylum screening, when they first arrive at the US border.”

-- Not a single refugee was resettled in the U.S. last month. From Quartz: “The nosedive is the result of a State Department freeze on admissions, according to a World Relief press release, resulting in hundreds of canceled flights and yet more uncertainty for the thousands of refugees hoping to resettle in the US. The department has issued an admissions ceiling of 18,000 for the financial year 2020—the lowest in almost 30 years, and well below the number of displaced people already in the pipeline to be resettled in the US.”

-- The Arizona activist who gave Central American migrants humanitarian aid has been acquitted on charges that he illegally harbored them. From the Guardian: The activist, Scott Warren, “was stoic after the verdict was read. His supporters were crying at the news of the decision. Warren, 37, testified that neutrality guides his work near the border and denied he has ever helped migrants hide or instructed them how to avoid authorities. … Warren was arrested in January 2018 by US agents who were staking out a humanitarian aid station in Arizona known as The Barn, where two Central American men had been staying for several days. The prosecutor Nathaniel Walters said the men didn’t need medical attention and questioned the authenticity of Warren’s claim that he was ‘orienting’ them before they left the camp. The camp is run by a group that tries to prevent immigrants from dying in the desert.”

-- Five American journalists sued the U.S. government, alleging that border authorities violated their First Amendment rights by inspecting their cameras and notebooks and questioning them about their coverage of last year’s migrant caravan. From the AP: “Mark Abramson, a photographer working for The New York Times, said two CBP officers patted him down when he returned to the U.S. at the San Diego border crossing on Jan. 5. They emptied his pockets and searched his bag, which contained notebooks with ‘confidential source material,’ the names and contact information of people he encountered while working, personal reflections and receipts to be submitted to his editor for reimbursement, the lawsuit said. After being taken to another room and patted down again, Abramson said another officer asked what was in his ‘book,’ who was leading the caravan, whether they were for or against the U.S. government and whether he knew of any groups helping the caravan.”

-- A judge blocked the scheduled executions of four death row inmates, delaying -- at least for now -- Trump's efforts to resume capital punishment in the federal system. From Politico: “The order issued Wednesday night by U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan halts four executions that U.S. officials planned to carry out starting next month. The only other execution that officials had put on the calendar, also for December, was blocked last month by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. In July, Attorney General William Barr announced plans to resume executions at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. He suggested the practice had been allowed to languish for too long and said it would deliver justice in cases involving what he called the ‘worst criminals.’”

-- Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) continue their quest for answers in the killing of Bijan Ghaisar by two U.S. Park Police officers in 2017 after the Justice Department decided last week not to charge the officers. Tom Jackman reports: “The two senators requested a briefing from FBI Director Christopher A. Wray about the case, and they also sought answers in a series of letters they have sent the FBI beginning last year, which the FBI has previously declined to provide. In addition, three members of Congress have asked the FBI to allow the release of the 911 call made at the beginning of the incident, which may shed light on why the officers repeatedly approached Ghaisar’s Jeep Grand Cherokee with guns drawn after Ghaisar left the scene of a minor fender bender in Alexandria on Nov. 17, 2017.”

-- Trump urged Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint Rep. Doug Collins (R) to fill a Senate seat left vacant by Johnny Isakson. From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “It’s the second time in two weeks that Trump directly appealed Kemp to appoint Collins, who was long considered a top contender to fill [Isakson’s seat] before a multimillionaire financial executive applied. Kelly Loeffler submitted her application hours before the Monday deadline, apparently scrambling Collins’ calculations. Loeffler, a financial executive who co-owns Atlanta’s WNBA franchise, is widely considered by GOP insiders to be Kemp’s favorite for the coveted post. When Collins was pressed ... earlier Wednesday about whether he was contemplating a bid for the office regardless of whether he’s selected, he confirmed his interest.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump said China isn’t “stepping up,"" as the trade talks show new signs of languishing. David J. Lynch reports: “Trump’s comments, made while touring an Apple supplier facility in Texas, came as investors appeared to be growing impatient with his inability to deliver the promised accord. Asked by a reporter if the deal would be completed this year, the president said: ‘I haven’t wanted to do it yet because I don’t think they’re stepping up to the level that I want.’ After nearly a year of bargaining, negotiators remain stuck on several core issues, including the extent of Chinese commitments to buy American farm products and U.S. willingness to reverse its tariff plans. … ‘We continue to talk to China. China wants to make a deal. The question is: Do I want to make a deal? Because I like what’s happening right now. We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars,’ Trump told reporters in a misleading reference to his tariffs on Chinese products, which are overwhelmingly paid by American companies. Privately, Trump is more eager to announce a finished agreement and is being counseled by his trade advisers to lower his expectations, according to a senior administration official.”

-- Hong Kong has now taken center stage in the U.S.-China showdown after Congress passed a bill intended to protect human rights on the island amid months-long protests. Simon Denyer and Tiffany Liang report: “Hong Kong’s stock market slid more than 1.5 percent, with shares across Asia and U.S. equity futures also falling, amid concerns the intensifying dispute over the city’s future could delay or derail an interim U.S.-China trade deal. … The prospect that the bill’s passage could harm U.S.-China relations and dent prospects of a trade deal appeared to undermine investor confidence. China summoned the U.S. Embassy’s acting chief, William Klein, in Beijing to express its condemnation of the bill, and vowed ‘strong countermeasures’ to defend its sovereignty. … The slide in shares eased slightly after China’s chief trade negotiator, Liu He, said he was ‘cautiously optimistic’ about reaching an interim trade deal with the United States.”

-- The Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 30 soldiers this week in the West African nation of Mali. Danielle Paquette reports: “In a statement late Wednesday, the group’s West Africa arm said it wounded another 30 soldiers while mentioning no deaths among its fighters. The Malian army, which routinely tangles with extremists in the country’s restive north, said Tuesday that 17 enemy militants were killed in the fight at Tabankort in the Gao region, which borders Burkina Faso and Niger. U.S. officials say the Sahel region, which lies south of the Sahara Desert, threatens to become a safe haven for terrorists to plot and launch attacks worldwide. Mali, which is twice the size of Texas, is a particularly troubling hot spot. … More than 100 soldiers have died in Mali since October in near-weekly clashes as the resource-strapped country tries to shake off a scourge that took root after the Libyan government collapsed in 2011.”

-- Benny Gantz, the former Israeli army chief, failed to put together a governing coalition, prolonging Israel’s political gridlock and making it likely that voters will have to vote in a third national election in less than a year. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Gantz, who has rocketed to the top tier of Israeli politics, caused a stir in October when he became the first person other than Benjamin Netanyahu to be given a chance to form a government here in a decade. Twenty-eight days later, his mandate to try is expiring with no parliamentary majority in sight. … Gantz said in a statement Wednesday that he had informed Israeli President Reuven Rivlin that it was not possible to form a government. ‘I left no stone unturned. I sifted through every grain of sand,’ Gantz said in a televised address. He accused Netanyahu, the prime minister, of negotiating not in good faith over a possible unity government but ‘with childish videos and slogans.’ For the next three weeks, the law allows any member of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, a chance to do what Gantz and Netanyahu could not: cobble together the 61 votes needed to form a government. If this, too, falls short, as most analysts predict, the country’s deja-vu nightmare will continue with another election, probably in March.”

-- Britain’s Prince Andrew is quitting his public duties “for the foreseeable future” after a chaotic interview during which he defended his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “Essentially, the Duke of York will now go dark — as sponsors of some of the 200 charities he endorses had already begun to abandon him, concluding that he no longer casts a royal glow but controversial shade. In a statement Wednesday, Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, said: ‘It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work.’ He added: ‘I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.’”

-- Six Iranian environmentalists were sentenced to prison for “collaborating” with the U.S. Erin Cunningham reports: “The defendants, part of a group of eight imprisoned environmentalists, were arrested and jailed by the elite Revolutionary Guard Corps early last year for their work tracking the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah. The trial sparked outrage among conservationists worldwide.""

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro shrugged off a government report that deforestation in the Amazon reached an 11-year high on his watch. Marina Lopes reports: “‘Deforestation and fires will never end,’ the pro-development president told reporters in Brasilia. ‘It’s cultural.’ The comments were quickly condemned by environmentalists, who fear that the Amazon is approaching a tipping point at which large swaths of the rainforest will be irrevocably lost. … The Brazilian Amazon lost 3,769 square miles of rainforest between August 2018 and July 2019, Brazil’s National Space Research Institute reported this week, an area almost 1½ times the size of Delaware. That was up 30 percent from the previous year.”

-- An increasingly popular product has sparked a bloody cartel war in Mexico: the avocado. From the Los Angeles Times: “Mexico’s multibillion-dollar avocado industry, headquartered in Michoacan state, has become a prime target for cartels, which have been seizing farms and clearing protected woodlands to plant their own groves of what locals call ‘green gold.’ More than a dozen criminal groups are battling for control of the avocado trade in and around the city of Uruapan, preying on wealthy orchard owners, the laborers who pick the fruit and the drivers who truck it north to the United States.""

-- Myanmar’s government announced that its leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, will head a legal team it will send to the International Court of Justice to contest a charge of genocide filed against the regime. From the Times: “The country’s military has been accused of carrying out mass rapes, killings and the torching of homes during a counterinsurgency campaign launched in western Myanmar in August 2017 after rebel attacks. The violence sent more than 700,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar’s population is overwhelmingly Buddhist. … The head of a U.N. fact-finding mission on Myanmar warned last month that ‘there is a serious risk of genocide recurring,’ and the mission also said in its final report in September that Myanmar should be held responsible in international legal forums for alleged genocide against the Rohingya. Myanmar has strongly denied carrying out organized human rights abuses.""

In his testimony, Sondland further pushed the notion that Trump didn't really care about corruption in Ukraine;

""He had to announce the investigations. He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it."" - Sondland.



This is key. It was never about corruption. It was about tarring a domestic political opponent. — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) November 20, 2019

A Post foreign affairs columnist argued that we still don't have enough information about Rick Perry's role in this scandal:

One of the biggest rocks not yet turned over involves Rick Perry. Sondland says he had crucial early calls with Giuliani. Holmes said he had private meetings with Ukrainians to discuss gas deals. Tried to put friends on board of state gas company. No wonder he won't talk. — Jackson Diehl (@JacksonDiehl) November 20, 2019

A Vox editor noted this troubling detail:

Arguably the scariest part of this whole scandal isn’t that Trump knew he was doing the wrong thing, but that he has so conflated his interests with the national interest, his enemies with the public’s enemies, that he believed it the right thing. — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) November 20, 2019

And a Bloomberg reporter noted this one:

Odd Point:



Trump said Oct. 2 he held up the aid because he wanted other European countries to pony up more money for Ukraine. ""I don't like being the sucker country""



He apparently never communicated this to his *Ambassador to the European Union.* — Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) November 20, 2019

The Post's fact-checker dug out email proof that contradicted a State Department defense of Pompeo:

Sondland mentioned rapper A$AP Rocky in his testimony, and no one batted an eye:

it's somewhat unsettling that ASAP Rocky has come up in the House impeachment inquiry and it didn't initially strike me as remotely odd or strange — Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) November 20, 2019

After testifying, Sondland made it to his flight:

VIDEOS OF THE DAY:

Stephen Colbert joked that Sondland “spilled the tea” about Trump and Ukraine:

Seth Meyers thinks yesterday might have been the most devastating day of the Trump presidency… so far:

Sam Bee has concluded that all the president’s men colluded:"

During debates, Google is where Americans turn to find the answers to their less academic questions. We expect Wednesday night to be no different, when Democratic 2020 presidential candidates face off in Atlanta. Anticipating that curiosity — and since The Washington Post is one of the evening’s co-hosts — we figured we’d make it easier for you. This article will be updated during the debate with the most common questions about the candidates that are bubbling up on Google.

We’ll start by answering the questions Americans had coming into the debate, the five most common queries for each of the 10 candidates who will be onstage. Many of the questions, you’ll note, are of the form for which anonymous Web searches are ideal: goofily mundane — but still interesting. Now, thanks to us, you won’t have these trivialities muddying your Google search history.

QUESTIONS DURING THE DEBATE

Two questions that emerged during the debate focus on tangentially mentioned issues.

What is a Rhodes Scholar? Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) referred to the Rhodes Scholarship during the debate, saying that he was the “other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage.” (The first was South Bend., Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.)

AD

A Rhodes Scholarship is an elite educational fellowship granted to 32 college students annually based at Oxford University. They are chosen, per the scholarship website, “not only for their outstanding scholarly achievements, but for their character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.”

AD

What is Citizens United? Amy Klobuchar mentioned she would advocate a constitutional amendment overturning “Citizens United.” It’s a reference to a Supreme Court decision — Citizens United v. FEC — decided in 2010. In essence, the decision opened the door for corporate spending in politics, a shift that many Democrats point to as a cause of a massive influx of money that has disproportionately bolstered Republican candidates.

What religion is Pete Buttigieg? Buttigieg is Episcopalian. He talks about his religious background with some regularity and has suggested that Democrats need to do a better job reaching out to religious voters.

Not really a question, but Google did share the most common height-related questions shortly before the debate began. People are actually most interested in knowing how tall Buttigieg is. (The figures here are relative to interest in Buttigieg.)

Buttigieg is apparently 5-foot-9, according to a college student who called his campaign.

PRE-DEBATE QUESTIONS

Former vice president Joe Biden

Who is Joe Biden? Joe Biden is a former vice president of the United States, serving under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. Before that, he was a U.S. senator from the state of Delaware. He’s twice run for president before and neither time did very well — though he did essentially parlay his 2008 bid into the vice presidency.

When did Joe Biden enter the race? On April 25 of this year, later than many of his competitors.

Is Joe Biden running for president? Well, yes.

Is Joe Biden a Democrat? He is.

Where is Joe Biden from? Good question! While Biden is generally associated with Delaware, given his decades of service to that state, he and his campaign would also like to remind voters that he was actually born in Scranton, Pa., a salt-of-the-earth, blue-collar city in the northeastern part of the state. He lived there for much of elementary school.

AD

AD

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)

Who is Cory Booker dating? Booker’s love life has long spurred interest in gossip columns. But his current romantic partner, actress Rosario Dawson, is probably the highest-profile person with whom he’s been connected.

Is Cory Booker still running for president? He is. Though his campaign has been one big rocky patch since he announced, it hit a particularly rocky patch in September when Booker made public that he needed an infusion of contributions to keep going. He got the money and got to stick around.

That he is participating in the debate is a good sign that he’s still in the race.

How old is Cory Booker? An even 50.

AD

Is Cory Booker married? Happily for Ms. Dawson, he is not.

Who is Cory Booker? New Jersey’s junior senator and the former mayor of Newark. He gained national attention in that role for both his charisma and his fight against corruption and poverty in the city.

Is Pete Buttigieg gay? Happily for Chasten, he is.

How to pronounce Buttigieg? Allow Jimmy Kimmel to explain.

How old is Pete Buttigieg? He is 37. Should he win, he’d be the youngest president by nearly four years, turning 39 the day before inauguration.

Who is Pete Buttigieg? The mayor of the Indiana city of South Bend, near the University of Notre Dame. That title will change shortly, though, since Buttigieg didn’t seek reelection to his post.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii)

Who is Tulsi Gabbard? A native of American Samoa, Gabbard now serves as a representative from the slightly closer islands that constitute Hawaii.

Is Tulsi Gabbard married? She is, to a cinematographer named Abraham Williams.

AD

How old is Tulsi Gabbard? A little less than a year older than Buttigieg. Or, more directly: 38.

Is Tulsi Gabbard still in the race? Yes. Like Booker, though, she’s not polling very well.

What does Tulsi Gabbard stand for? This is a pretty broad question and one, at least in this case, that is probably better left for the debate. Or you can see our comparison of the candidates’ policy positions.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.)

Who is Kamala Harris? California’s junior senator and the state’s former attorney general. She’s a native of the San Francisco Bay area, which may explain why she’s looking for more affordable housing in Washington.

How old is Kamala Harris? Harris is 55.

Is Kamala Harris still running? She is. In fact, for a few weeks, she was among the front-runners after a terribly effective exchange with Biden in the first debate. That bump soon faded, though, and Harris’s campaign is now struggling. But: She’s in the debate!

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

How old is Bernie Sanders? Sanders is 78. If he were elected, he’d be the oldest president inaugurated in history — and would be older than any president has been at the end of his term.

AD

How much is Bernie Sanders worth? His income topped $1 million after his 2016 run, which critics have seized upon as contradictory to his campaign focus on reducing income inequality. Most of that income was a function of the book he wrote. His net worth is slightly higher, thanks to his and his wife’s ownership of two homes.

Is Bernie Sanders a Democrat? He’s not. He’s a political independent — something that frustrates some Democrats who aren’t fans of his candidacy.

What is Bernie Sanders’s net worth? Why does this sound familiar?

Who is Bernie Sanders? A senator from the state of Vermont, though, as his accent reveals, a native of Brooklyn. In high school, he was a track star.

Businessman Tom Steyer

Who is Tom Steyer? A billionaire businessman who’s been tangentially involved in politics for several years now. In 2014 and 2016, his focus was on electing candidates focused on climate change. Since 2016, his focus has been on President Trump’s ouster.

How did Tom Steyer make his money? Finance. Specifically, hedge funds.

How old is Tom Steyer? Steyer is 62.

Where is Tom Steyer from? Like Sanders, Steyer is from New York City. Fittingly, he is from Manhattan.

How old is Elizabeth Warren? Warren is 70.

How much is Elizabeth Warren worth? Warren and her husband are worth an estimated $12 million, both from real estate and retirement accounts. (Warren may have set aside more for retirement than it seems she’s interested in using.)

Is Elizabeth Warren married? She is. Bruce Mann is a professor at Harvard, as Warren herself once was.

Who is Elizabeth Warren? A senator from Massachusetts and, interestingly, a former Republican. During the financial collapse a decade ago, Warren was a prominent voice in criticizing the failures of the banking industry, leading to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

How did Elizabeth Warren make her money? Warren did private practice legal work while also teaching and has written a number of books.

Businessman Andrew Yang

Who is Andrew Yang? An entrepreneur and attorney who is something of a wild card in the Democratic race.

Is Andrew Yang still running for president? He is. In fact, he’s polling better than a number of established politicians.

How old is Andrew Yang? Yang is 44.

Where is Andrew Yang from? He was born in Upstate New York, depending on how you define “upstate.”

How tall is Andrew Yang? It’s sort of amazing that this is the only instance in which this normally popular question was asked. People seem to have been a lot more curious about how much Democrats are worth than how tall they are.

Anyway, it’s not entirely clear how tall he is. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) says Yang is taller than he is, and Cruz is apparently 5-foot-11."

That might generate some tense moments for a front-runner, but do not be surprised if the leaders flick away a minor candidate, focusing on his or her main competition.

Second, the debates have been helpful to one ideological side in the Democratic Party: The moderates. In September’s debate, Warren was challenged on how to pay for her health-care plan without taxing the middle class. That forced her to unveil her gargantuan Medicare-for-all plan, which in turn may have contributed to her slide. Warren may get attacked from both sides, from moderates chiding her for trying to drum them out of the party for advancing a plan that now looks like hers (a public option as a first step) and from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been on a bit of a comeback since his heart attack and could well accuse Warren of losing her nerve.

Third, we will see if the moderates — enjoying a resurgence of late in part due to the adverse reaction to Warren’s health-care plan and in part because of polling suggesting far-left proposals may put the Midwest at risk for Democrats — continue to pummel Warren or if they pivot to attack Buttigieg, whose climb in early state polls poses a threat to Biden and those seeking to be the Biden-alternative if the former vice president fades. The moderates do not want to fall into the trap of alienating the progressive side of the party so it is very likely they’ll react to Warren but let Sanders and the moderators grill her on her health-care position.

Alternatively, Warren and Sanders have the chance to push back, defend their “big structural change” and once more criticize their fellow Democrats as insufficiently bold. If they back down, trying to appeal to some of those moderate voters, it will be a sure sign that they’ve realized their success depends on broadening their base.

They may want to consider a new Gallup poll showing: “Six in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer to see the party nominate the candidate with the best chance of beating President Donald Trump, even if that person does not share their views on key issues. By contrast, 36% say they would rather have the reverse: a candidate aligned with them on almost all the issues they care about, even if that person is not the most electable.” The argument that Warren has made herself less electable by tying herself to Medicare-for-all may be the central problem with her campaign at this point.

We also will look to see if foreign policy, in light of the impeachment hearings and the Syria debacle, plays a significant role in the debate. (Politico reports: “The withdrawal and incursion allowed [the Islamic State] to ‘reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad,’ the quarterly report from the lead inspector general on the U.S. military campaign against ISIS stated.”) Candidates who want to pull out of the Middle East may be forced to explain how their approach is any better than Trump’s.

Buttigieg has been speaking more about his service recently (partially because of the Veterans Day holiday). Don’t be surprised if he throws a punch against Republicans who have been challenging the loyalty and patriotism of witnesses such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who created a viral moment on Tuesday, even evoking applause from the audience:

Buttigieg feels more comfortable talking about foreign policy and the military than many of his opponents, so the more he can defend U.S. foreign policy goals (e.g., protecting Europe against Russia) the more he will be playing to his strength while showing how he would take it to President Trump in the general election.

Finally, this is the first debate in presidential history in which all the moderators are women (not to mention four of the 10 debaters). We will see if they collectively raise topics that have largely been ignored in earlier debates — K-12 education, child care, pay equity, the opioid epidemic and sexual assault in the military. There is no more important group to Democrats than women, especially suburban women, yet many issues of concern to them have not been fully addressed.

Ten candidates on stage for the debate in Atlanta on Wednesday (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

ATLANTA — The fifth Democratic debate was a study in omission, with candidates revealing their strategies and theories of victory by what they chose not to say. Moderators set the tone, focusing on fresh topics (paid family leave, America's relationship with Saudi Arabia) rather than litigating the past few weeks of arguments.

The candidates largely went along, using the briefer format (two hours with overtime, rather than three) to make their preferred case for how the party can win. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered a Medicare-for-all answer that would have silenced her critics in October; Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) made the kitchen-sink attack on Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that she whiffed four months ago. And South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had been pointedly criticized by Harris and others in the last few weeks, took only a little incoming, toward the end of the night, after the ink was drying on stories about how Buttigieg was in the clear.

Joe Biden. He's become the most consistent debater in the field, and not always in a good way. Biden always emphasizes his long experience, and the easy-to-imagine work he'd do as a new president, undoing the Trump administration's work. But for the third time, Biden's campaign previewed a strategy that the candidate himself abandoned. An attack on Warren's Medicare-for-all ""candor"" never materialized, with Biden instead arguing that his own health insurance plan would ""trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest.""

Biden also said something memorably confusing toward the end of the night, which has become a theme of these debates. Here, it began with a minor slip, saying he had been endorsed by the ""only African American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate."" He meant ""first,"" and said so after a befuddled Harris threw up her hands up. But then he went on to suggest ""one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my long-standing relationship with the black community,"" an intriguing remix of history; Barack Obama's 2008 campaign saw Biden as a running mate who could answer concerns about Obama's experience and appeal to Midwestern white voters, not fix any problems with black voters.

None of these debates has left Biden in a stronger position in early states; none has changed how Democrats see him, as the candidate most appealing to general-election swing voters.

Elizabeth Warren. She spent most of the past month answering the question that bedeviled her in October's debate: Could she be straight with voters about the costs of Medicare-for-all? Wednesday's debate gave her an answer, as her rivals had next to zero interest in re-litigating the Medicare-for-all fight and no rebuttal to her new transition plan. Warren got to deliver exactly the pitch she wanted: She'd quickly enroll millions of Americans in an expanded health insurance system with ""vision and dental and long-term care,"" then move to universal coverage ""when people have had a chance to feel it and taste it and live with it.""

Some minor verbal flubs aside (a ""billion"" when she meant ""million""), Warren executed her usual plan: Pivot to the deeper problems she wanted to fix and reject the idea that she was too left-wing. Only Warren was asked whether she'd ""use taxpayer money"" to unbuild new sections of the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border (she pivoted to attacking the ""zero tolerance"" family separation policy); only Warren was asked whether antiabortion Democrats had a place in the party. Several times, she made a specific argument for black voters (the wealth tax, for example, would help ""stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women,"" who work in child care), which was pitched to her potential audience, not debate commentators.

Warren's early success in these debates came with no fireworks, no breakthrough moments, apart from a quick put-down of former Maryland congressman John Delaney in July. Wednesday's debate was a return to the norm, with the candidate describing an agenda that could be passed with a few popular tax hikes on the rich. It worked before, and it's to be seen whether it works after a month of Medicare-for-all arguments.

Pete Buttigieg. His trajectory has been remarkably similar to Warren's in these debates — a steady rise, then one debate where the counterattacks are a little softer and more tentative than expected. That was what Warren experienced in September and what Buttigieg got Wednesday. There was just one question about his embarrassing ""Douglass Plan"" rollout, which counted endorsers who had not actually endorsed him, and Harris opted not to chase it. (""I believe that the mayor has made apologies for that."") Buttigieg's opponents mostly set him free to pitch his potential as a candidate and not bog down in his record.

""I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me,"" Buttigieg said in what could have been the most challenging round of questions. ""As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.""

The irritation other Democrats have for Buttigieg flashed only a few times, subtly (Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey noting that he had run the ""largest city"" in his state) and less subtly (Sen. Amy Klobuchar contrasting her legislative wins with Buttigieg's aspiration). Going negative is risky, and Buttigieg, last month, was the first Democrat to do it effectively. No one tried to do it better Wednesday.

Bernie Sanders. Like Buttigieg, he's sometimes ignored by opponents because they don't see him as a threat for the nomination. The tight format of a debate accentuates this; after Sanders made a historic defense of Palestinian ""dignity"" and called for ""rethinking who our allies are around the world,"" moderators moved on and asked Warren about the virtues of military service. Several times, he was left out of discussions where his bigger vision — housing policy or immigration — would have separated him from the field.

Sanders, like Warren, also benefited from the strange way Biden and Buttigieg had set up questions about ""division."" It was simple: He was for a big agenda that most Americans already wanted. ""Yeah, we've got to deal with Trump,"" Sanders said, ""but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn't just go to the people on top."" And he was not baited into an argument with Warren, whom he'd criticized over the details of her Medicare-for-all payment and transition plans. That arrangement, in the past, usually kept Sanders's support stable while Warren's increased. But that was before Biden et al began portraying Sanders as an honest candidate and Warren as not.

Kamala Harris. Harris's first answer, combining her ""criminal living in the White House"" with her plea for the ""working people who are working two or three jobs,"" set the tone: She has overlaid her ""3 a.m. agenda"" of economic issues, which was not clicking anywhere, with a personal, impassioned promise to ""prosecute"" the president like a B-movie gangster. ""He has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego,"" Harris said, bringing back the diminution of Trump that made her initially so intriguing to Democrats.

Harris's decision to finally attack Gabbard mattered for the same reason. The Californian's pitch has always been more about electability than any particular policy; her mistake in July was allowing Gabbard to go unanswered. Harris corrected that error by filling one of the most popular roles for any candidate, defending Barack Obama from his critics.

Amy Klobuchar. She benefited last month from needling Warren on whether her plans were achievable, but she was more subtle Wednesday, the reward of finally taking up some head space for primary voters. ""I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said, referring to no particular candidate. The senator from Minnesota is never going to compete for left-wing voters, not in the primary; her goal has been to paint a picture of how she would win a national election, so that nervous Democrats see an alternative to Biden.

Most Democratic primary voters are women, and in this debate, Klobuchar took and effectively used the most time to talk to them about electability. ""If you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,"" she said, a line that's been incredibly effective on the trail — a line that voters, catching dribs and drabs of election information in between impeachment news, mostly hadn't heard.

Cory Booker. The ongoing mystery of these debates is why Booker, a powerful speaker with a compelling biography and long list of endorsements, cannot break out of the low single digits. He channeled his frustration into some memorably funny lines (""I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage"") and an argument for why his personal, love-centric style could carry a national election. ""I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together,"" he said, ""but it's not for a kumbaya moment.""

In a debate with fairly little negativity, Booker did the most to set up a contrast where voters took his side: marijuana legalization. ""Marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people,"" Booker told Biden, making use of a recent clip of Biden speaking about marijuana that got little attention before the debate. ""The war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.""

That resulted in Biden's defensive riff on his endorsements from black Democrats, allowing Booker to do what he'd tried to do all year: Contrast his more immediate, modern policies with Biden's long record with black voters.

Andrew Yang. In the past few weeks, he's tried to humanize his message of universal basic income, asking voters to imagine how their lives could change with $1,000 every month. He got and took every chance to do that, especially a curveball question on fighting the rise of white supremacy. ""We have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks,"" he said, going further than the usual answer of stepped-up law enforcement.

Tulsi Gabbard. The defining moments of her campaign so far were the July attack on Harris and her weeks-long demand for an apology from Hillary Clinton, who had accused her of being ""groomed"" for a Trump-assisting third-party campaign. Both gave her an audience that overlaps hardly at all with her rivals: conservatives and independents who, like Gabbard, think the party is corrupt. Her problem Wednesday was that she got to talk about almost nothing else: A round on voting rights became an argument with Buttigieg over his ""inexperience in national security and foreign policy."" (Gabbard had jumped on a largely misreported Buttigieg point about cooperation between American and Mexican military forces.)

Tom Steyer. The first negative exchange of his campaign so far, a back-and-forth with Biden, revealed less about Steyer than about what his rivals think about him: Why is he doing this? Steyer's fundamental problems are a business-experience-not-politics pitch, which most Democratic voters don't want, and a focus on term limits as his major structural reform. Democrats don't find that compelling, either. ""Even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits,"" Steyer said, a zinger with no constituency.

Wisconsin's gold standard pollster has found tight general election trial heats in the state all year, no matter what's been happening in the Democratic primary. This is the first poll to show most of the Democratic field trailing the president. The numbers for Booker and Klobuchar, based on a sample of just half these voters, have a higher margin of error. Just a few days after Democrats held onto the Louisiana governor's mansion, they are discovering panic again, nervous about the president's resilient poll numbers with Republicans and the independents who backed him before.

2020 New York primary (Siena, 380 Democrats)

Joe Biden: 24% ( 3)

Elizabeth Warren: 14% (-7)

Bernie Sanders: 13% (-3)

Pete Buttigieg: 5% ( 1)

Kamala Harris: 3% (-1)

Apart from Warren's slide, the biggest movement in this poll was for uncertainty. Twenty-nine percent of Democrats had no candidate preference, up from 24 percent last month, with liberal voters becoming particularly unsettled. Sanders, who relaunched his campaign (after his heart attack) in Brooklyn, lost ground within the margin of error; the gains for middle-tier candidates seen in places where they've campaigned extensively didn't show up. New York's primary doesn't come until April, and states later on the calendar, seeing only a little candidate activity, may reflect what the many non-Bidens worry about: A national conversation about impeachment makes it tough for others to break through.

DEBATE SEASON

The sprint to December's debate in California started as soon as the lights went out in Georgia. Candidates know the rules: Getting onstage means attracting 200,000 donations and hitting 4 percent in four DNC-recognized polls or 6 percent in two polls from the early states.

After that? It's not settled yet. On Wednesday, after a DNC forum on voter protection, DNC Chairman Tom Perez told The Post that the rules will change again in January and might not include the same metrics.

“We have our rules in place for November and December, and those rules have both the grass-roots fundraising threshold and a polling threshold,” Perez said. “We haven’t set the rules for after the first of the [new] year, and that's something that we're doing right now. We always set the rules early enough so that we can give notice to the campaigns.”

Mike Bloomberg, who keeps moving toward a presidential bid, has said he will not raise money from small donors. Under current rules, that would prevent him from accessing any debate stage. But Democrats, said Perez, have yet to determine whether future debates will require small donations.

“One thing we will consider is, what should the rules of engagement be after people have started voting?” Perez said. “Because right now, zero votes have been cast. The voters haven't spoken. What should the rules be once the voters have spoken, and we have some actual data from states? That’s the question that we are considering now.”

2020

Sometime between his campaign announcement and his Medium post announcing that the campaign had ended, Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam stopped running for president. He held no events after a mid-July fun run in South Carolina; he hurriedly hired and fired campaign staff who accused him of stiffing them; he raised just $15,000 in his final quarter. (For the second consecutive quarter, he actually misreported the total and later corrected it.)

“Despite not getting the same early media exposure as other candidates were freely given and transferring millions of dollars from existing federal campaign accounts as many of the candidates did,” Messam wrote on Wednesday, “my campaign shocked many by being recognized as a credible candidate, registering in polls in early states, nearly making the first debate and polling just behind the top four candidates in my battle ground state of Florida in a recent Florida Atlantic University Poll.”

Mike Bloomberg. His long, slow journey toward a presidential campaign got longer on Thursday: He filed Mike Bloomberg 2020 Inc. with the Federal Election Commission. But, no, he’s not running yet; while Bloomberg has now filed for president in three states and federally, his political operation said that it was not a final decision.

Joe Biden. On Thursday morning in Atlanta, he met with black mayors who had written an open letter asking Democratic presidential candidates to sit and listen to their concerns.

Pete Buttigieg. He closed out his Georgia visit with a stop at a National Action Network breakfast, where he responded to some criticism of how he invoked anti-gay bigotry he’d experienced in a debate round about racial discrimination.

“What I do think is important is for each of us to reveal who we are and what motivates us, and it's important voters understand what makes me tick, what moves me and my sources of motivation in ensuring that I stand up for others,” he said.

Buttigieg was introduced by NAN President Al Sharpton, who said “cynics in the media” sometimes suggested that “homophobia in the black community is different than homophobia in America.”

Cory Booker. He’s heading back to New Hampshire for two days of events, working to capitalize on his debate performance in a state where he’s won plenty of early support from elected officials.

Elizabeth Warren. She’ll rally in Atlanta on Thursday night for the third major set-piece speech of her campaign, about the legacy of black labor movements. From there she’ll head back to New Hampshire for an organizing launch and a town hall.

Bernie Sanders. He held a post-debate rally at Atlanta’s Morehouse College, promoting a plan to make all historically black college and universities tuition-free and make billions in strategic investments. He’ll then spend the weekend in New Hampshire on a “labor appreciation tour.”

Kamala Harris. She sat for a Thursday morning interview in Atlanta with Higher Heights, a female black empowerment group that endorsed her last week; over the weekend she'll campaign in Iowa, then South Carolina.

Amy Klobuchar. She joined other Democrats at Sharpton's breakfast and will return to New Hampshire for campaign events over the weekend.

Deval Patrick. He wrapped up a whirlwind tour of early-voting states Wednesday and intended to cap it with an appearance at Atlanta's Morehouse College. The problem, per CNN's Annie Grayer: Just two people showed up for Patrick's appearance, and he hurriedly scrapped it.

WHAT I'M WATCHING

Indivisible, the grass-roots group launched to pressure the last Republican Congress to stop the Trump agenda, is holding a series of interviews with Democratic candidates for a potential endorsement. The process began with a questionnaire that only a few candidates answered and will continue on Thursday with in-person candidate interviews: Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer, from Atlanta. A central focus of the interviews will be getting candidates to commit to ""democracy reform"" in their first year as president, passing campaign finance reform, giving statehood to Washington, D.C., and breaking the Senate filibuster to do it.

“The establishment forces within the Democratic Party will focus on something like, how can we pass a reconciliation package a bit and invest in infrastructure,” said Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, shortly before the interviews began. “That will be the push. The only way this gets done is if whoever gets elected says, this is my top priority, and if you don’t do this, you will make my presidency a failure.”

By the end of 2018, there were well more than 3,000 Indivisible chapters around the country, filling a large and complicated role in the Democratic Party by mobilizing new activists, mostly women, who came off the bench after 2016.

Joe Biden. Biden’s plan would create a new government insurer — a so-called “public option” — that would compete with private insurance companies in the open market. This new government insurer would give health insurance to millions of Americans and aim to drive down exorbitant costs by creating competition. This differs from a “Medicare-for-all” system in which all existing insurance systems are folded into one single-payer plan.

Biden’s plan would not be as disruptive or expensive as single-payer, but it would also leave millions of Americans without health insurance and not eliminate medical bills.

Biden’s plan would automatically enroll in the government plan the approximately 5 million Americans who live in poverty in states that did not expand Medicaid. He would also make the federal subsidies under Obamacare substantially more generous, giving middle-class tax credits to reduce their premium charges. His plan contains other changes, such as outlawing surprise medical billing, using antitrust powers to break up health-care corporations and limiting prescription drug prices.

Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg’s plan is similar to Biden’s: Both would create a new public option that competes with private insurers. Both would enhance federal tax credits under Obamacare for middle-class health-care costs. And both would leave private insurance largely untouched.

Buttigieg proposes doing more than Biden in a few small but important ways. Unlike Biden, Buttigieg is also pushing a hard cap on out-of-pocket costs for seniors in the existing Medicare system.

Perhaps the key difference between these moderates is that Buttigieg would automatically enroll people in plans on the public option if they’re eligible. He is silent on what happens to people who refuse to pay after being automatically enrolled, but says he will create a backstop fund to pay providers “for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured.”

Buttigieg’s plan, like Biden’s, is estimated to cost about $1 trillion over 10 years, far less than the $30 trillion sticker shock that comes with the liberals’ single-payer plans.

Elizabeth Warren. Rhetorically, Warren has aligned herself with Sanders’s “Medicare-for-all” proposal to establish a single-payer system. But she has proposed that America first approve a public option and not pass a single-payer system until the third year of her administration.

Warren’s public option would be substantially more aggressive than that of either Biden or Buttigieg. She would automatically enroll everyone younger than 18 into the plan and not charge them any premiums, guaranteeing free insurance to all children. It would also be free for everyone earning 200 percent of the federal poverty line (about $51,000 for a family of four). The existing Medicare program would also expand dental benefits to its existing population.

But Warren’s plan stops short, at least until year three, of pushing for a single-payer plan that would move all Americans — including the 150 million or so who get their insurance through their employer — onto the government plan.

Unlike Sanders, Warren has insisted she can pay for single-payer without raising taxes on the middle class, instead putting the burden on the wealthy and businesses. Some economists have questioned that claim.

Bernie Sanders. Sanders’ plan, the most aggressive in the race, would amount to the biggest transformation of the American health-care system in the country’s history.

Under this Medicare-for-all system, every American would be guaranteed medical, dental, vision and auditory care with virtually no deductibles, premiums or co-payments of any form. There is no apparent limit on how many times people could go to the doctor or the dentist and have the government pick up the tab."

No, the Democrats are not pining for former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick (who had to cancel a campaign event in Atlanta when almost no one showed up), nor for former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. I would like to think that Democrats are wise enough to latch onto someone like wonky moderate Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), but that doesn’t seem likely to happen.

While Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), plainly the winner of the President Trump/Bashar al-Assad primary, and Tom Steyer have zero chance of becoming the nominee, as many as half a dozen candidates are very much in the race. Put aside the polls 75 days out from the Iowa caucuses and look at the candidates with the gravitas, political skills and ground game to finish strongly in that contest. Forget the never-ending media narrative that former vice president Joe Biden is at political death’s door. Realistically, Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), any of the three female U.S. senators on the stage or South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could finish in the top few slots in Iowa. For some, that will be a moral victory (Comeback Kid Kamala Harris comes in third!); for others, it will confirm that they deserve top-tier status (Buttigieg blitzes!). From here on out, candidate quality and organization will determine the Iowa winner.

Next, let’s do away with the “Democrats have moved too far left!” narrative. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is scrambling to get back into the electability zone by modifying her Medicare-for-all plan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Buttigieg are battling for the “Midwest moderate” label, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had his best debate defending wealth creation and international leadership based on American values. The race for the sweet spot — progressive but electable — is on.

Then there is the “Biden is a goner” storyline. To be clear, he makes plenty of small gaffes (“punching” against domestic violence, boasting of his support from the “only” black woman elected to the Senate), but none has or is likely to dislodge his core base of support, especially among African American voters who know him and appreciate his loyalty to former president Barack Obama. Every once in a while, as he did on foreign policy questions, Biden reminds us that the prospect of an experienced insider sounds attractive to an electorate that has watched Trump blow up one alliance, government institution and norm after another. (“I’d go back in making sure we had the alliances we had. ... [Trump] has given North Korea everything they wanted, creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jong Un, who’s a thug — although [Kim] points out that I’m a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick.”) Biden might not win the nomination, but he has as good a chance as four or five of his rivals.

Finally, Klobuchar went a long way toward burying the notion that women are “risky.” It often feels that pundits have forgotten that a slew of women won House, Senate and governor races in 2018. Klobuchar put it well when she declared, “I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you’ve got to win. And I am the one, Mr. Vice President, that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as a lead on a ticket every time. I govern both with my head and my heart.” With a well-received joke, she concluded, “And if you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.” Four of the 10 candidates in the pared-down debate were women, who were asked a flurry of policy questions from four female moderators. Women have a permanent place at the highest levels of media and politics. To quote Mick Mulvaney, “Get over it.”

“For too long candidates, I think, have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,” Harris said. “They show up when it’s close to election time, show up at a black church.”

She urged the party to do more to rebuild the Obama coalition.

“I completely agree,” Buttigieg said. “I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters who don’t know me.”

Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) criticized former vice president Joe Biden in blunt terms, attempting to peel away the black voters who have been the backbone of Biden’s support.

“Black voters are pissed off, and they’re worried,” Booker said. “I have a lot of respect for the vice president … But this week I heard him literally say that ‘I don’t think we should legalize marijuana.”

AD

Looking toward Biden, Booker said, “I thought you might have been high when you said it.”

AD

Biden said that marijuana should be decriminalized but that its long-term effects need to be further studied before it was fully legalized.

“I come out of the black community in terms of my support,” Biden said. “They know me.”

Biden also claimed to have the support of “the only black African American woman had ever been elected to the United States Senate.” It was an apparent reference to an endorsement from former senator Carol Moseley Braun (Ill.), but disregarded Harris — who, onstage, laughed and shrugged.

The debate came with less than three months remaining before the voting begins in Iowa, and as the field is growing both larger and more fluid. It also came after a convulsive day in Washington, with riveting testimony in Washington’s impeachment hearings extending to just before the candidates took the stage. The event began only hours after U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told the committee he believed the president used the power of the Oval Office for his own political gain.

Trump has denied wrongdoing and has disparaged several of the witnesses testifying in the probe. Five of the 10 presidential candidates who appeared on the stage are U.S. senators who may ultimately have to decide whether to convict Trump during a trial that could coincide with voting in the early nominating contests next year.

“The president felt free to break the law again and again and again,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “We have to establish the principle: No one is above the law. We have a constitutional obligation, and we need to meet it.”

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris said.

Biden chided his party for the chants that have been breaking out at some Democratic events where attendees have been shouting “Lock him up!” — a reference to Trump that echoed the line about Hillary Clinton that Trump supporters rallied around during the 2016 campaign.

“I don’t think it’s a good idea that we mock that — that we that we model ourselves after Trump and say, ‘Lock him up,’” Biden said. “Look, we have to bring this country together. Let’s start talking civilly to people and treating — you know, the next president starts tweeting … anyway,” he said, trailing off.

“Look, it’s about civility,” he continued. “And that’s not who we are. That’s not who we’ve been. That’s not who we should be. Follow the law.”

Biden said emphatically that he would not order his Justice Department to prosecute Trump, but he held out the possibility that it could do so if the attorney general he appointed thought it was warranted.

AD

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), in an aggressive debate performance, pointedly stood by her recent comments about a double standard harming the female candidates. She had said that if a woman had the same résumé as Buttigieg — mayor of a midsize city — she would likely not be on the presidential debate stage.

AD

“What I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard,” Klobuchar said. “Otherwise, we could play a game called Name Your Favorite Woman President, and which we can’t do because it has all been men.”

She later dismissively referred to him as a “local official.”

While impeachment is a unifying topic for Democrats, the presidential race has showcased the party’s internal struggle over how much of the campaign should revolve around Trump’s fate, versus maintaining the issue-heavy focus that led the party’s 2018 House candidates to a majority. Within the policy field is a separate Democratic fight, over whether to pursue the sweeping policy changes backed by its liberal wing or embrace a more-moderate vision for bringing the country together after Trump.

“We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said. “If we are, you know what? We’re going to lose the election.”

For the fifth debate in a row health care was a prominent topic, with the party still grappling over whether it should continue to defend the Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama or aim for a more far-reaching program that would again upend the health-care system.

It has become one of the most vigorously fought topics, with Warren and Sanders proposing a Medicare-for-all plan that would abolish private insurance and place all Americans under a government-run system.

Warren, who has released two new parts of her health plan since the last debate, spoke briefly about her new approach to ­government-run health care, which would open the Medicare program to all Americans before trying to force them. “When people have had a chance to feel it, taste it and live with it, we’re going to vote,” she said, and the country will approve, she predicted.

Sanders chimed in that he “wrote the damn bill” and stressed that he would push for a compulsory government-run health-care system in his first week in office. “The current health-care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional,” Sanders said.

But the more-moderate candidates onstage also defended their approaches. Buttigieg said that Americans would not like to be told what to do. “Commanding people” to go into Medicare, he said, “is not the right approach to unify the American people.”

Biden used skepticism of Medicare-for-all on the part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to bolster his own plan.

“Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn’t think it make sense,” he said. “We should build on Obamacare.”

AD

Pelosi’s name was cited several times during the debate, a testament to her emergence as a revered party figure.

AD

“If you think a woman can’t beat Trump,” Klobuchar said. “Nancy Pelosi does it every day.”

Buttigieg has emerged as a clear primary front-runner in some states, with a recent poll putting him ahead of the pack in first-to-vote Iowa. His opponents began sharpening their attacks on him before the debate even started, with some questioning his experience as a small-town mayor and others challenging him directly over his handling of racial issues.

Buttigieg came into the debate fresh from a controversy in which his campaign touted the backing of more than 400 South Carolinians for his “Douglass Plan for Black Americans,” even if they did not endorse Buttigieg himself. That led some signatories to feel their positions had been misrepresented.

It also emerged that Buttigieg’s campaign had used a stock photo of a woman and child in Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan; the campaign said the image has been removed from its website and apologized for its inclusion.

Buttigieg conceded that he has struggled to connect with black voters. He noted that he has not experienced discrimination because of the color of his skin, but said he felt some common cause with minorities because he is gay.

“I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,” said Buttigieg. And he said he was able to watch “my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side, shoulder to shoulder.”

Biden, when asked about being more sensitive to the cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and violence toward women, spoke of how he took advice from college students to “get men involved, engage the rest of the community.”

“We have to just change the culture, period,” Biden said. “And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it.”

Some of the most personal exchanges centered on Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and her biting criticism of the party she is running to represent.

“Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,” Gabbard said. “It’s a party that is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others, foreign policy by the military industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.”

Harris jumped in and ridiculed Gabbard for her harsh criticism of fellow Democrats, along with her ties with Trump administration officials and her willingness to meet with Syria President Bashar al-Assad.

There also were several moments of levity, with candidates displaying their sense of humor and a familiarity with one another.

“I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends,” said Klobuchar, reprising one of her standard jokes.

“I don’t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them,” Buttigieg said in a reference to Trump. “I don’t even golf.”

When billionaire Tom Steyer was pressed on his level of political spending, entrepreneur Andrew Yang jumped to his defense.

“We have a broken campaign finance system,” he said. “You can’t knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, in my opinion”

“Thanks, Andrew,” Steyer said with a grin.

“No problem,” he said in return."

It covered a much broader range of concerns than the earlier encounters, including an extensive set of queries on foreign policy. While the contenders tangled over a few issues — notably, as always, health care — they avoided fireworks, cracked the occasional joke (Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota especially) and spent far more time in vehement agreement than they did in loud disagreement.

The political upshot: While several trailing candidates, including Klobuchar and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) did well, little happened to disturb the foursome that currently leads in both national and early-state polling: former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Biden had a painfully slow response to an opening question and an embarrassing gaffe when he referred to “the only African American woman who’d ever been elected to the United States Senate” with Harris onstage nearby. But he also had some his strongest moments of the encounters so far. He was particularly quick and clear when asked by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow whether he would seek an indictment of President Trump. Biden quickly replied: “I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I’d let them make their independent judgment.”

Sanders was resolutely himself from beginning to end. Counterintuitively, in a party that loathes Trump, he opened the debate by pivoting off a question about the president declaring, “We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump” and offering a very on-brand assertion that the economic well-being of working Americans needed to be the Democrats’ highest priority.

Warren was dominant in the early going with a brisk defense of her wealth tax, which she repeatedly described as asking those earning more than $50 million just “two cents” on the dollar. She spent more time describing the programs her tax would finance, including universal child care and the cancellation of student loan debt, than on the levy itself. “We can invest in an entire generation’s future,” she said.

Warren was not left unchallenged, with Booker sounding the most conservative note in emphasizing the need to “give people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses.” But it was not until Buttigieg criticized Warren’s support for Medicare-for-all — he pushed his public-option alternative, Medicare-for-all-who-want-it — that she faded back into the group.

AD

AD

As expected, Buttigieg, who is surging in the polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire, was tested by several of those running behind. Klobuchar, who had said that a woman with Buttigieg’s qualifications would not be taken seriously as a candidate, said she considered Buttigieg qualified but that “women are held to a higher standard.” She drew appreciative laughter when she declared: “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.”

The typically well-prepared Buttigieg offered his best answer of the night in addressing his lack of appeal among African Americans. “My faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society.” And he argued that the fact that he was gay — “sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country” — created a special obligation to stand up for the rights of others.

Buttigieg probably helped himself with a tough and testy exchange across a range of issues toward the end of an encounter with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who draws particular hostility from a large share of Democratic voters.

But such fireworks were the exception, not the rule. This was the debate that sent a signal that Democrats differ far more with Trump and the Republicans than they do with each other. The question that came to mind after some of the harsh and more narrowly focused brawls earlier in the year was: How could this party possibly unite? The question that dominated on Wednesday was: Do these contenders really disagree all that much?

Of course, they do disagree, as Warren and Sanders especially wanted to make clear by way of contrast with their more moderate adversaries. But it was a salutary break from an all-Trump, all-the-time Washington to hear discourses on how to build houses, how to make college affordable and how to help families care for their kids. It offered hope that politics might, someday, be about more than the antics of a self-involved, corrupt and out-of-control chief executive.

This is false.

— South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg

This is false.

In a civil complaint filed in June 2018, then-Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood of New York charged that the now-defunct Donald J. Trump Foundation had violated a federal law known as the Johnson Amendment, which bars charities from supporting candidates for office.

AD

Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign “extensively directed and coordinated the Foundation’s activities in connection with a nationally televised charity fundraiser for the Foundation in Des Moines, Iowa on January 28, 2016,” Underwood charged.

AD

The fundraiser was billed as an effort to “raise funds for veterans’ organizations,” but the Trump campaign commandeered nearly $2.8 million in donations and “dictated the manner in which the Foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants.”

The president settled the lawsuit, but did not admit liability. A New York state judge on Nov. 7 noted in a court order that “the Funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans.”

AD

As FactCheck.org reported, “donations totaling $2.825 million were given to 34 veterans organizations between January 2016 and June 2016,” such as AMVETS and the Green Beret Foundation.

“You’ve got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.”

— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

AD

The way Sanders frames this is exaggerated. His number came from a single-night survey done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to measure the number of homeless people. For a single night in January 2018, the estimate was that 553,000 people are homeless.

But the report also says that two-thirds — nearly 360,000 — were in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs; the other 195,000 were “unsheltered” — i.e., on the street, as Sanders put it. The number has been trending down over the past decade. It was 650,000 in 2007.

“I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $50 billion dollars in assets. Your first $50 billion is free and clear, but your 50 billionth and first dollar you’ve got to pitch in two cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you’ve got to pitch in a few pennies more.”

AD

— Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)

Warren’s “Ultra-Millionaire Tax” would apply to households with a net worth of $50 million or more, essentially the wealthiest 75,000 households. (She misspoke when she said $50 billion.) They would be charged 2 percent of every dollar of net worth above $50 million, unless they’re billionaires.

Households with $1 billion or more in assets would start paying 3 percent on assets above $1 billion. At least that was in Warren’s first iteration of her tax plans. She said this tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years. But to help fund her plan for universal health care, she recently announced that she would also charge another 3 percent to billionaires, for a total of 6 percent. So that’s six pennies.

“By asking billionaires to pitch in 6 cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion, we can raise an additional $1 trillion in revenue,” Warren said in explaining how she would fill the $20.5 trillion hole created by her Medicare-for-all proposal. While 6 percent a year may not seem like much, it would add up to more than 50 percent over 10 years for billionaires.

“Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically related issues. They come down with cancer, and that’s a reason to go bankrupt?”

— Sanders

Sanders often repeats this talking point, asserting that 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical issues. That’s approximately two-thirds of the 750,000 total bankruptcies per year.

AD

For this debate, however, the senator modified the wording of his claim. Sanders previously said 500,000 people a year go bankrupt from medical debt, but now he says “medically related issues.” This formulation more accurately reflects the study he’s quoting.

The claim is based on a study published by the American Journal of Public Health in March. The researchers surveyed debtors and asked about factors that contributed to their bankruptcies. Forty-four percent said either medical bills or loss of work related to illness “very much” contributed; 22 percent said either medical bills or illness “somewhat” contributed. Combining both groups of respondents, the study estimated 530,000 bankruptcies a year.

AD

But the study doesn’t establish that all 530,000 bankruptcies were caused by medical issues. It’s broader because it measures contributions, not causes, to bankruptcy, and includes respondents who said these contributions factored into their bankruptcy either “somewhat” or “very much.”

AD

A different study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the same question of medical bankruptcies and found that the rate was far lower: 30,000 to 50,000 a year. However, this study was limited to non-elderly people in California who were admitted to the hospital for non-birth-related reasons, so it covers only a subset of all people facing medical debt.

The research team Sanders cited once included Warren, who contributed to earlier versions of the study when she was a Harvard University professor. Interestingly, though, Warren doesn’t make the same claim about 500,000 medical bankruptcies a year.

“I have led the way on voting, and I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this and we did something about gerrymandering and we stopped the voting purges and we did something significant about making sure we don’t have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of the state right now.”

AD

— Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.)

“It was voter suppression right here in Georgia targeting African Americans that prevented governor Stacey Abrams from being in office right now.”

— Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.)

Many Democrats claim Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor’s race because of racially motivated voter suppression. Many Republicans claim that there’s no evidence for that assertion and that their candidate won fair and square. In a previous fact check, we talked to experts and took a close look at the data.

AD

Brian Kemp, Abrams’s Republican opponent who is now governor, was basically in charge of running his own election because he was Georgia’s secretary of state at the time and declined to recuse himself.

AD

Kemp oversaw an aggressive effort to purge voters, with nearly 700,000, or 10 percent, removed from the rolls in the year before the election. “For an estimated 107,000 of those people, their removal from the voter rolls was triggered not because they moved or died or went to prison, but rather because they had decided not to vote in prior elections,” according to a report by American Public Media.

But there’s a counterargument, too. Even if every provisional ballot not counted and every rejected absentee ballot had been awarded to Abrams, it would not have overcome Abrams’s 55,000-vote deficit. The 2018 turnout was far greater than any previous midterm, according to FiveThirtyEight, and more African Americans voted in 2018 than in 2016.

AD

Where you land depends on how you view the wide range of pertinent evidence. Klobuchar and Booker suggested their statements were a factual claim, not in dispute, though it’s really more of an opinion.

“With more African Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children.”

— Booker

There are several problems with this claim. First, as Booker framed it, it’s simply wrong. The 1850 Census counted 3.6 million slaves. That’s compared with African Americans constituting 2.3 million, or 34 percent, of the total 6.8 million correctional population in 2014.

A Booker spokeswoman sent us a link as evidence to a 2014 PolitiFact fact check about a different claim — that more black men are now in prison than were slaves in 1850. “There were about 1.68 million African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African American men who were enslaved in 1850,” the fact check said, rating it “true.”

But that’s not what Booker said.

Moreover, even if the black men comparison is correct in terms of raw numbers, it’s still misleading because the U.S. population has soared since 1850, as our colleagues at Wonkblog noted in 2015. The census that year found that roughly 9 in 10 of the nation’s 3.6 million blacks were enslaved. By contrast, 1 in 11 blacks is under correctional supervision today, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

“There are only two countries in the world that don’t have paid family leave for new moms: the United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list and we need to get off this list as soon as possible.”

— Businessman Andrew Yang

It may seem like a surprising statistic, but Yang is correct, according to a March report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Paid maternity leave is also guaranteed in every country except Papua New Guinea and the United States, the report said. An International Labor Organization report reached the same conclusion. At least one other report also listed Lesotho, Liberia and Swaziland as countries that also do not provide paid family leave.

“When black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America …”

— Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.)

This is correct, and Harris carefully uses the phrasing “in connection with childbirth,” as not all of the deaths occurred during childbirth. A 2018 report from nine maternal mortality review committees reported that about 700 women in the United States die each year as a result of pregnancy or pregnancy-related complications.

“Non-Hispanic black women experience maternal deaths at a rate three to four times that of non-Hispanic white women, a racial disparity that is mirrored across many maternal and infant outcomes,” the report said. “Nearly 50 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths were caused by hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions, cardiomyopathy, or infection. … Preeclampsia and eclampsia, and embolism were leading underlying causes of death among non-Hispanic black women.” The report said that more than 60 percent of the pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.

REP. TULSI GABBARD: I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels. ….

BUTTIGIEG: I know that it’s par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today’s politics.

GABBARD: Are you saying that you didn’t say that?

BUTTIGIEG: I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We’ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships for example.

— Exchange during the debate

After the two candidates tangled over Buttigieg’s comments, Gabbard said the fact-checkers would sort it out. We looked into it, and Buttigieg has decent grounds to say his remarks were taken out of context.

Here’s how Reason magazine reported his comments:

Asked if he would consider military assistance in Mexico, if the country were to request any, Buttigieg told ABC7 reporter Adrienne Alpert: “If it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure our neighbor to the South is secure."" But Buttigieg also hedged significantly, saying he’d only send troops into conflict if American lives were on the line, if there were no other choice, and if treaty obligations necessitated involvement. More importantly, he’s not suggesting anything like President Donald Trump’s tweet that he’d be happy to send U.S. forces down to Mexico to “wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.”

Reason summarized: “So the totality of Buttigieg’s comments make it pretty clear that he doesn’t actually want to send troops down to Mexico to help fight drug cartels, but he might be willing to consider some sort of security agreement to provide military assistance.”

The Sacramento Bee reported that the campaign pulled the comment back even further: “His campaign later clarified that Buttigieg would only be open to military use as a ‘last resort’ in response to Mexican cartel violence or an outside threat that endangers the country’s security.”

Nevertheless, as our colleague Nick Miroff noted, even this would be a significant step. “Buttigieg is correct that U.S.-Mexico security cooperation goes back years, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (and other U.S. agencies) have been working with Mexican military to target cartel bosses since [George W. Bush.] But a US troop deployment would be a major escalation,” he tweeted. “The question would only be relevant if Mexico wanted a US troops deployment. And Mexico doesn’t.”

Suddenly, they are asserting their influence in a presidential primary long dominated by liberal ideas and candidates one-upping each other with ever more sweeping propos… [+8374 chars]",The rise of several more centrist candidates coincides with an overt push against several policies that some Democrats believe could cost them the general election.,2019-11-21,The Washington Post,Moderates fight back in a presidential race defined so far by liberal ideas,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/moderates-fight-back-in-a-presidential-race-defined-so-far-by-liberal-ideas/2019/11/21/e49f9500-0bdf-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html,"With voting set to begin in less than three months, moderate Democrats have struck back. Suddenly, they are asserting their influence in a presidential primary long dominated by liberal ideas and candidates one-upping each other with ever more sweeping proposals to enact fundamental changes and dramatically expand government services.

The debate here Wednesday night served as the clearest indication yet of this shift, which reflects rising concerns among party leaders and voters that Democrats risk losing to President Trump in 2020 if they embrace polarizing ideas. It also underlines former vice president Joe Biden’s inability thus far to cement his standing as the moderate standard-bearer in the race, prompting nervous Democrats to give others a closer look.

“The narrative was, ‘Look, the Democrats have been taken over by the liberals and it’s the party of AOC,’ ” said former Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), referring to liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). “I think there’s been a reaction to that, which is, ‘That’s not the Democratic Party I signed up for.’ ”

The presidential campaign’s ideological battle is far from settled, however, with staunchly liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) showing a resurgence since his Oct. 1 heart attack. His improvement has put pressure on the other leader on the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), to stand firmly behind liberal priorities as she seeks at the same time to broaden her appeal to more traditional Democrats.

But efforts by prominent Democrats to nudge the candidates toward the middle have been mounting. Recent electoral victories by centrists in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia — which built on themes that helped Democrats prevail in last year’s midterm contests — have prompted calls in the party to apply their winning formulas to the 2020 landscape.

Former president Barack Obama recently broke from his practice of saying little about the race in public when he issued blunt warnings to the candidates about the dangers of veering too far left.He is expected to reprise that theme at a party fundraiser Thursday in Silicon Valley, according to an aide.

Some moderate Democrats who initially declined to enter the race have had a change of heart. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick jumped in last week. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor and one of the world’s wealthiest people, filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a candidate. His presence has prompted outrage from Sanders and many of his supporters.

The tone of Wednesday’s debate stood in contrast to earlier showdowns that had more anti-establishment, leftward bents. Where there was once criticism from Obama’s left about the former president, Wednesday brought nothing but praise for him, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris’s calls to “rebuild the Obama coalition.” The name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who routinely has counseled a middle course, was invoked positively. The heated exchanges over highly charged issues such as gun buybacks and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings that headlined earlier debates were nowhere to be found.

Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old South Bend, Ind., mayor, has risen to the top of some recent polls in all-important Iowa as he has repositioned in the moderate lane and as an alternative to Biden. He has paired his pitch for generational change with calls for bipartisan healing in the post-Trump era.

“I’m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country,” he said Wednesday. “And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever.”

It was clear that several of Buttigieg’s rivals came prepared to elbow into the space he has crafted of late. Booker (D-N.J.), who is running on a similar platform, referred to himself as the “other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage.” (Booker also sought to present himself as a strong contrast to Warren when he critiqued her proposed wealth tax.) Klobuchar, a fellow moderate, said that while Buttigieg often says “the right words,” she has the right experience.

AD

AD

Klobuchar also challenged some of the ideas Warren and Sanders are promoting, mostnotably free tuition at public colleges and universities and a Medicare-for-all system in which the government is the sole insurer. “I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,” she said.

Warren’s maneuverings on Medicare-for-all have provided one of the clearest glimpses of the field’s broader shift toward a more moderate posture. After declaring “I’m with Bernie” in a June debate, Warren faced questions and criticisms about whether she would finance the plan on the backs of middle-class taxpayers and what it would mean for the future of private insurance.

Earlier this month, she broke from Sanders, releasing a financing plan that she said would not require a middle-class tax hike. She also added an intermediate step that would allow Americans to choose to stick with their private insurance for the first three years of her administration.

AD

AD

On Wednesday, she said her most immediate priority would be bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and protecting the Affordable Care Act that Obama passed in 2010 — decidedly moderate positions.

Advocates of expanding Obama­care instead of scrapping it in favor of Medicare-for-all, including Biden, Klobuchar and Buttigieg, have become more aggressive in defense of their plans. They have argued for them on policy and political grounds.

“I don’t think we should be trashing Obamacare,” Klobuchar said early Thursday. “That’s not what the people in Kentucky just said or the people in Virginia. They want to build on it.”

She added: “The American people are watching us right now. And this debate, if we just focus on Medicare-for-all, day after day after day, it’s not real.”

AD

On the opposite end of the spectrum is Sanders, who has vowed to push for a Medicare-for-all bill in his first week as president. The current system is “not only cruel, it is dysfunctional,” Sanders said Wednesday.

AD

Although Obama has not stated a preference in the insurance debate, he has mentioned health care, along with border security and immigration, as areas where far-reaching changes have proved to be tough sells for many Americans and which, if not handled properly, could complicate the party’s path to victory.

His views are both consistent with his presidency and reflective of broader Democratic fears about the danger of the party’s nominee being cast in the general election as far more liberal than the nation overall.

AD

“I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a bold enough proposal,” Obama said at a Democracy Alliance summit last week. “People rightly are cautious because they don’t have a lot of margin for error.”

AD

Some Democrats rejected the notion that the center of gravity in the primary is shifting toward the middle. “I think what the race is doing is deepening,” Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia and a potential vice presidential pick, told reporters in Atlanta hours before Wednesday’s debate. “We are getting more thoughtful information.”

A rise in centrist energy could have an unintended effect, some Democrats said, by crowding the lane that Biden, Buttigieg and others are competing in and splitting that vote. Such a scenario could clear a path for Sanders or Warren to consolidate support on the left and give them more establishment foes to rail against, those Democrats said.

AD

“Bloomberg is a really effective foil for Bernie and what Bernie’s stood for for years and years,” said Sanders’s pollster, Ben Tulchin.

AD

For Biden, the challenge is preventing his vote from splintering off to other candidates running on similar platforms. One major advantage he possesses is his ability to appeal to African American voters, which others, particularly Buttigieg, have struggled mightily to do so far. Several of the candidates made pitches before black voters in Atlanta on Thursday as they sought to shore up their support, a prerequisite to launching a full assault on Biden.

While Biden’s partisans denied he would cede any moderate turf, others suggested there were nonetheless upsides to the conversations dominating now."

I’m Rachel Maddow here in Atlanta, Georgia, tonight with my fellow moderators. Andrea Mitchell is NBC news foreign affairs correspondent and the host of “Andrea Mitchell Reports” on MSNBC. Ashley Parker is White House reporter for the Washington Post. And Kristen Welker is NBC News White House correspondent.

MITCHELL: We'll be covering a wide range of topics tonight, including national security, race, and climate. Each candidate will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer our questions and 45 seconds if we need to follow up. And we ask the audience to respect the candidates and please don't interrupt.

MADDOW: There's 10 candidates here tonight. No time to waste. Let's get right to it.

We're in the middle of the fourth presidential impeachment proceedings in our nation's history. Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically.

Senator Warren, you have said already that you've seen enough to convict the president and remove him from office. You and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also U.S. senators may soon have to take that vote. Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?

AD

WARREN: Of course I will. And the obvious answer is to say, first, read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And that's what's happened with Ukraine.

AD

We have to establish the principle: no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.

But I want to add one more part based on today's testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what's happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington.

AD

You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they're going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I've taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don't ask to be an ambassador, because I'm not going to have that happen.

I asked everyone who's running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.

AD

MADDOW: Senator Warren, thank you.

Senator Klobuchar, you've said that you support the impeachment inquiry but you want to wait for a Senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president. After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?

AD

KLOBUCHAR: I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct and I've called for an impeachment proceeding. I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count and make a decision.

But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake. This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country's interest, and this is wrong.

AD

This is a pattern with this man. And it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day. That is what this guy does.

AD

And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that's going to put our country first. I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum. And on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect. And he said this: We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a president of the United States.

MADDOW: Senator, thank you.

Senator Sanders, I'd like to go to you. Americans are watching these impeachment hearings. At the same time, they're also focused on their more immediate, daily economic and family concerns. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?

AD

AD

SANDERS: Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election.

Right now, you've got 87 million people who have no health insurance or are underinsured. We're facing the great existential crisis of our time in terms of climate change. You've got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street and you've got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing.

What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump's corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.

AD

AD

MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, let me put the same question to you. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by the impeachment inquiry be to a Democratic nominee's campaign? How central would it be to yours?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics. And it is not a part of the campaign. But the president's conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen in the abuse of power that we're learning more about in the investigations -- but just to be clear, the president's already confessed to it on television. But that's just part of what we've seen.

Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we're also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump presidency comes to an end one way or the other.

AD

I'm running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country. And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever and, while doing it, address big issues that didn't take a vacation for the impeachment process or for the Trump presidency as a whole: a climate approaching the point of no return, the fact we've still got to act on health care, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold on to what they've got.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor.

BUTTIGIEG: Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president and will be at the heart of our campaign.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Andrea?

MITCHELL: Vice President Biden, you've suggested in your campaign that if you defeat President Trump, Republicans will start working with Democrats again. But right now, Republicans in Congress, including some of whom you've worked with for decades, are demanding investigations not only of you but also of your son. How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?

BIDEN: Well, look, the next president of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump, that's number one. And, number two, going to have to be able make be -- be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority. That's what I'll do.

You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place? And, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate?

And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned, number one, that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear. He held up aid to make sure that -- while at the same time innocent people in the Donbas are getting killed by Russian soldiers.

Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn't want me to be president. So I -- I've learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that -- that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question: Who is most likely to do what needs to be done, produce a Democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?

MITCHELL: Senator Harris, your thoughts about that?

HARRIS: Well, first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House. And there is no question that in 2020 the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot.

And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president, from what we heard today, the vice president, the secretary of state, and the chief of staff.

And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue, and back to the question that you asked earlier, which is, what does this mean for the American people?

Because what it means, when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America: the powerful people who with their arrogance think they can get away with this and then everybody else.

Because here's the thing. For those working people who are working two or three jobs, if they don't pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don't pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody. And part of the reason I'm running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people, and not just for some.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Warren, you have cast yourself as a fighter. If you were elected, though, you would be walking into an existing fight, a country that is already very divided over the Trump presidency, among other things. Do you see that divide as permanent? Or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals?

WARREN: So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks.

You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $50 billion in assets, your first $50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, you've got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you've got to pinch in a few pennies more.

Here's the thing. Doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It's about saying, you built something great in this country? Good for you. But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You did it using -- you're getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.

So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one tenth of one percent big, pitch in two cents so everybody else gets a chance to make it.

And here's the thing. That's something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about, because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and say we're going to make real change.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator. Thank you.

Senator Booker, do you agree with that strategy?

BOOKER: Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats. And I don't agree with the wealth tax, the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue.

But here's the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth, as well.

When I stood in church recently and asked folks in a black church how many people here want to be entrepreneurs, half the church raised their hands. If we as a country don't start -- if we as a party don't start talking not just about how to tax wealth, but how to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream -- because, yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour.

But the people in communities I frequent, they're not -- aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities in opportunity. And that's what our party has to be about, as well.

MITCHELL: Senator Warren, you wanted to respond?

WARREN: Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one-tenth of one percent in this country, and we can provide universal child care for every baby in this country ages zero to five. That is transformative.

We can provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women, who do this work. And we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and pre-schoolteacher in America.

We can put $800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who've got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation's future.

MITCHELL: All right. Let me let Senator Booker respond.

WARREN: Sure.

BOOKER: You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. We're all united in wanting to see universal preschool. And I'll fight for that. We're all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for two parents that went to HBCUs.

But the tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry, it's cumbersome. It's been tried by other nations. It's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation.

But, again, we as Democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it. Look at VC dollars in this country. Seventy-five percent of them go to three metropolitan areas. There is worth in the inner city. There is value in our rural areas.

If I am president of the United States, we're going to have a fair, just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but, dear God, we're going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans. We're going to see a change in what we see right now. Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

BOOKER: We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth.

MITCHELL: Senator Warren, briefly, just your last thoughts on this.

WARREN: So I just -- the idea behind what is fair, today, the 99 percent in America are on track to pay about 7.2 percent of their total wealth in taxes.

BOOKER: I'm not disagreeing with that.

WARREN: The top one-tenth of one percent that I want to say pay two cents more, they'll pay 3.2 percent in America. I'm tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it's time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets a real...

(CROSSTALK)

MITCHELL: ... Senator Booker, Senator Warren...

BOOKER: Everybody's tired of corporations getting away with paying zero taxes.

MITCHELL: Thank you.

BOOKER: I'm not disagreeing with that.

MITCHELL: Thank you very much, Senator Warren. Thank you.

Mayor Buttigieg, you have said, quote, ""I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point."" The Republican Party never stopped fighting President Obama in his eight years in office. So what would you do that President Obama didn't do to change that?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we're in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn't exist in the same way even a few years ago.

Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing, if we can galvanize, not polarize that majority. For example, on health care, the reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal health care is that that is something that as a governing strategy we can unify the American people around, creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not.

And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years, as Senator Warren has proposed, or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

Kristen Welker?

WELKER: Let's talk about Medicare for all. Senator Warren, you are running on Medicare for all. Democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care: protecting Obamacare. Democrats are divided on this issue. What do you say to voters who are worried that your position on Medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general election?

WARREN: So I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can't afford it, people who didn't take the tests the doctor recommended because they just can't afford it.

So here is my plan. Let's bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can as fast as we can. On day one as president, I will do -- bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens. That's going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people. I'm going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration.

And in the first 100 days, I want to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000. I want to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and long-term care.

And then in the third year, when people have had a chance to feel it and taste it and live with it, we're going to vote and we're going to want Medicare for all.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Sanders, let me bring you into this conversation and ask you the question...

SANDERS: Thank you. I wrote the damn bill.

(LAUGHTER)

WELKER: I want to ask you the question this way, Senator Sanders. You described your campaign, including your plans for Medicare for all, as a political revolution.

SANDERS: Yes.

WELKER: President Obama explicitly said the country is, quote, ""less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,"" end quote. Is President Obama wrong?

SANDERS: No, he's right. We don't have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current health care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional.

Now, you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we've got 87 million uninsured, underinsured. In some cases, we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada or other countries. Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically related issues. They come down with cancer, and that's a reason to go bankrupt?

Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry. But you know what? If you think back to FDR and if you think back to JFK and Harry Truman and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about health care for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time.

And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all. Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses. That's where we've got to go.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden?

BIDEN: You know, we can do this without charging people -- raising $30 trillion, $40 trillion. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all.

SANDERS: Not true.

BIDEN: It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn't think it makes sense.

We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose, I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. A hundred and sixty million people like their private insurance. And if they don't like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal in my plan. Drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board.

But here's the deal, they get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them what the insurance companies -- they want no -- no competition. And my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.

WELKER: Vice President Biden, thank you.

Ashley?

PARKER: Congresswoman Gabbard, you have criticized Hillary Clinton as the, quote, ""personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party."" What is the rot you see in the Democratic Party?

GABBARD: That our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by, and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military industrial complex, and other greedy corporate interests.

I'm running for president to be the Democratic nominee that rebuilds our Democratic Party, takes it out of their hands, and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country. A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who are calling for an end to this ongoing Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm's way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security and have cost us thousands of American lives.

These are wars that have cost us as American taxpayers trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs. As president, I will end this foreign policy, end these regime change wars, work to end this new cold war and arms race, and instead invest our hard-earned taxpayer dollars actually into serving the needs of the American people right here at home.

PARKER: Thank you, Congresswoman.

Senator Harris, any response?

HARRIS: Oh, sure.

(LAUGHTER)

I think that it's unfortunate that we have someone on this stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama...

GABBARD: That's ridiculous, Senator Harris. That's ridiculous.

HARRIS: ... who has spent full time -- who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party, when Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower, fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the Democratic Party.

What we need on the stage in November is someone who has the ability to win. And by that, we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together. I believe I am that candidate.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

Congresswoman Gabbard, I'll give you a chance to respond.

GABBARD: What Senator Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I'm seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will as president continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive.

This is personal to me because I served in Iraq. I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in the medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war. I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as commander-in-chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always -- no, I'm not going to put party interests first. I will put the interests of the American people above all else.

PARKER: Thank you, Congresswoman. I want to -- I want to briefly give Senator Harris a final second to respond.

HARRIS: I believe that what our nation needs right now is a nominee who can speak to all people. I've spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom speaking five words: Kamala Harris for the people. And it was about all the people, regardless of their race, regardless of their gender, regardless of where they lived geographically, regardless of the party with which they're registered to vote or the language their grandmother speaks.

We need someone on this debate stage in November who has the ability to unify the country and to win the election. And I believe, again, I am that candidate.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

HARRIS: Thank you.

PARKER: Mr. Steyer, you have denounced the special interests that pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process to influence it. But, in fact, you have spent over $300 million of your own money in support of your political goals. How do you respond to critics who see you as the embodiment of a special interest?

STEYER: What I've done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to take on unchecked corporate power. We have a broken government in Washington, D.C. It's been purchased by corporations. Over the last decade, with the help of the American people, we have taken on and beaten the oil companies, we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies, we have taken on and beaten utilities, we've taken on and beaten the drug companies.

I’ve also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the United States. Last year, NextGen America did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history, also, in partnership with seven national unions, knocked on 15 million doors in 2016 and 10 million in 2018.

What I've done is to try to push power down to the America people, to take power away from the corporations who've bought our government. And I'm talking now about structural reform in Washington, D.C.

Term limits. If you want bold change in the United States, you're going to have to have new and different people in charge. I'm the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits. Vice President Biden won't. Senator Sanders won't. Even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change. I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy. It's time to push the power back to the people and away from D.C.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Steyer, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, a brief response.

(CROSSTALK)

KLOBUCHAR: Well, I just -- I'm someone that doesn't come from money, and I appreciate the work of Mr. Steyer. But right now, we have a system that's not fair, and it's not just fair for money. And so I would do is start a constitutional amendment and pass it to overturn Citizens United. That's what we should do, so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics.

I have led the way on voting. And I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be to allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this, and we did something about gerrymandering, and we stopped the voting purges, and we did something significant about making sure we don't have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

KLOBUCHAR: And that's what should happen. So while I appreciate his work, I am someone that doesn't come from money. I see my husband out there. My first Senate race, I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record. I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.

(LAUGHTER)

And I'd like to point out, it is not an expanding base.

(CROSSTALK)

KLOBUCHAR: So I don't just think this with my head. I feel it in my heart.

PARKER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.

BUTTIGIEG: Since I was named, I'd like to have time...

(CROSSTALK)

PARKER: Mr. Yang, I want to bring you in. Mr. Yang -- Mr. Yang, you've made a virtue of your outsider status. You've never served in military or in government. What has prepared you to respond to a terrorist attack or a major disaster?

YANG: Well, first, I just want to stick up for Tom. We have a broken campaign finance system, but Tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change. You can't knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, my opinion.

(APPLAUSE)

STEYER: Thanks, Andrew.

YANG: No problem.

(LAUGHTER)

As commander-in-chief, I think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century. And what are those threats? Climate change, artificial intelligence, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors.

And if you look up, we're in the process of potentially losing the AI arms race to China right now, because they have more access to more data than we do, and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of AI in a way that we are not.

We are 24 years behind on technology. And I can say that with authority, because we got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995. Think about that timing. I guess they thought they'd invented everything.

The next commander-in-chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow. And that's what I will bring to the table as commander-in-chief.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

Andrea?

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Mayor Buttigieg, let's talk about your record as a candidate. You were elected mayor in a Democratic city receiving just under 11,000 votes. And in your only statewide race, you lost by 25 points. Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?

BUTTIGIEG: Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump. I get that it's not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now.

In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he's been appealing to. I don't talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don't even golf.

(LAUGHTER)

As a matter of fact, I never thought I'd be on a Forbes magazine list, but they did one of all the candidates by wealth, and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage.

I also wore the uniform of this country and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room. And I know how to bring people together to get things done. I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small. The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small.

And I believe we need to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience, the experience on the ground, solving problems, working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government, recognizing what is required of executive leadership, and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best-run communities in the heartland before the other way around starts to happen.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mayor.

Senator Klobuchar, you've said this of Mayor Buttigieg, quote, ""Of the women on the stage, do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard."" Senator, what did you mean by that?

KLOBUCHAR: First of all, I've made very clear I think that Pete is qualified to be up on this stage, and I am honored to be standing next to him. But what I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard. Otherwise, we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can't do, because it has all been men.

(APPLAUSE)

And including all vice presidents being men. And I think any working woman out there, any woman that's at home knows exactly what I mean. We have to work harder, and that's a fact.

But I want to dispel one thing, because for so long why has this been happening? I don't think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president. I don't think you have to be the skinniest person. I don't think you have the loudest voice on this stage. I don't think that means that you will be the one that should be president. I think what matters is if you're smart, if you're competent, and if you get things done.

I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you've got to win. And I am the one, Mr. Vice President, that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as a lead on a ticket every time. I govern both with my head and my heart. And if you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Mr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President, just a quick response?

BIDEN: I think a woman is qualified to be president, and there's no reason why -- if you think the woman is the most qualified person now, you should vote for them. The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is, number one, I have brought people together my entire career. In the United States Senate, I've passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to dealing with Milosevic, the whole range of things that I've been engaged in my whole career.

I've done it. I've brought people together. I'm always told by everybody around here things have changed, you can't do that anymore. If we can't -- I thought the question was initially asked of the senator, how do you unify this country? We have to unify this country. I have done it. I have done it repeatedly.

And lastly, to be commander-in-chief, there's no time for on-the-job training. I've spent more time in the Situation Room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here. I know every major world leader. They know me, and they know when I speak, if I'm the president of the United States, who we're for, who we're against, and what we'll do, and we'll keep our word.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

Ashley?

PARKER: Senator Booker, one of the defining characters of the Trump presidency is that the American people hear from him directly all the time about everything, on Twitter and just about everywhere else. Setting aside your views of his tone, is that unfiltered communication something you as president would continue? Is this one of the norms broken by President Trump that needed to change?

BOOKER: So, look, this president has broken norms, as you've said. He used his platforms to demean, degrade, and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling. But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation.

So, absolutely, in that office I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together. But it's not for a Kumbaya moment. We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together. So, absolutely.

When I was mayor of the largest city in my state -- and this is where I agree with Mayor Pete -- mayoral experience is very important. And I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage.

(APPLAUSE)

And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal. In my city, we have racial divides, we have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling. The success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldn't be done.

When I am president of the United States, my campaign from the very beginning has not changed. My charge is to see a nation right now which has so much common pain, to channel that back into a sense of common purpose. And I will do whatever it takes, bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

Rachel?

MADDOW: Chants of ""Lock Her Up"" are still heard at President Trump's rallies today. Now some opponents of the president are turning the same slogan against him. They've chanted ""Lock Him Up"" at a recent World Series game in Washington and at a Veterans Day event in New York and, Senator Sanders, at at least two of your campaign events recently. Senator, should Democrats discourage this? Or are you OK with it?

SANDERS: Well, I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law. And what the American people are saying: Nobody is above the law. And I think what the American people are also saying is, in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law.

But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together not just in opposition to Trump. The initial question I think that you wrote -- that somebody raised here was that we are a divided nation. You know what? I kind of reject that.

I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. When you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real, they know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry, they know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy sufficiency and sustainable energy.

Even on issues like guns, the American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence. So I believe, yeah, we've got to deal with Trump, but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn't just go to the people on top but to all of us.

MADDOW: Vice President Biden, let me ask you to pick up on the issue that Senator Sanders just raised about no one being above the law. When President Ford pardoned President Nixon, he said it was to heal the country. Would you support a potential criminal investigation into President Trump after he leaves office, even if you thought it might further inflame the country's divisions?

BIDEN: Look, I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I'd let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated. That's not the role of the president of the United States. It's the attorney general of the United States, not the president's attorney, private attorney.

And so I would -- whatever was determined by the attorney general I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be, in fact, criminally prosecuted, then so be it. But I would not direct it.

And I don't think it's a good idea that we mock -- that we model ourselves after Trump and say lock him up. Look, we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people and treating -- you know, the next president starts tweeting should -- anyway.

(LAUGHTER)

Look, it's just -- look, it's about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country. And that's not who we are, that's not who we've been, that's not who we should be. Follow the law, let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me ask you briefly to respond to that, the difference of opinion there with Vice President Biden.

SANDERS: Well, I think Joe is right. I think that it is the function of the attorney general. But what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he's above the law. We have a president who has engaged in corruption. We have a president who has obstructed justice and, in my view, somebody who's violated the emoluments clause.

I think Joe is right, that is the function of an independent Department of Justice. But my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.

BIDEN: Can I respond very quickly?

MADDOW: Briefly, Senator.

BIDEN: Distinction, should he be impeached and should he be thrown out of office? That's one question. He's very close to -- he's indicted himself. Number two, after he's thrown out of office or after he's defeated, should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? That's a judgment to be made by an attorney general.

MADDOW: Mr. Vice President, thank you.

Ashley?

PARKER: We now focus on an issue facing many Americans, childcare and paid family leave. Here in Georgia, the average price of infant daycare can be as much as $8,500 per child per year. That's more than instate tuition at a four-year public college in Georgia. Mr. Yang, what would you do as president to ease that financial burden?

YANG: There are only two countries in the world that don't have paid family leave for new moms, the United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list. And we need to get off this list as soon as possible.

(LAUGHTER)

I would pass paid family leave as one of the first things we do. I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs, and it's breaking families' backs. We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning, because by the time they're showing up to pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases, they're already years behind.

Studies have shown that two-thirds of our kids' educational outcomes are determined by what's happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words read to them as children, type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them.

So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1,000 a month for every American adult, which would put in many cases $2,000 a month into families' pockets, so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child. We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce. Many parents see that tradeoff and say if they leave the home and work, they're going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway. In many cases, it would be better if the parent stays home with the child.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

(APPLAUSE)

Sticking with this topic, no parent in the United States is federally guaranteed a single day of paid leave when they have a new baby. A number of you on stage tonight have plans to address this. Senator Harris, you're one of the candidates proposing legislation to guarantee up to six months of paid family leave. And Senator Klobuchar, you're one of the candidates proposing up to three months. I want to hear from both of you on this, starting with you, Senator Klobuchar. Why three months?

KLOBUCHAR: I've looked at this economically, and I want to make sure that we help people. Because as just pointed out, we are way behind the curve, our country is, when it comes to providing paid family leave and childcare. We must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big.

But what I have done with all of my plans is I have shown how I'm going to pay for them meticulously. I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the White House right now one who has told over 10,000 lies.

So when you look at my website, at amyklobuchar.com, you will see my plans and you're also going to see how I'm going to pay for it. And I think that is so important, because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino, and really putting this country in a worst financial situation every single day.

So, yes, my plan is three months. I think that's good. I'd love to do more. As I've said before, I'd love to staple free diplomas under people's chairs. I just am not going to go for things -- and this is not -- I'm talking about Senator Harris' plan here, but I'm talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here. I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.

I think that we have an obligation -- we have an obligation as a party to be, yes, fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but make sure we have people's backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for. And that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I don't support, to kicking 149 million off their health insurance -- current health insurance in four years.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you.

KLOBUCHAR: I just think we have to be smart about how we do this.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator. And, Senator Harris, why six months? And also, how would you pay for that?

HARRIS: Sure. And, everybody, please visit my website, kamalaharris.org, for the details on everything I talk about. Six months, so part of how I believe we’re going to win this election is, it is going to be because we are focused on the future, we are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow.

So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s, often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents, which requires a lot of work, from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare to all of the activities that are required, much less the health care needs that are required.

And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on. So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women's lives today.

The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, but fast forward to the year of our lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American women 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.

PARKER: Thank you.

HARRIS: So my policy is about -- there's a whole collection of the work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and, therefore, the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

Kristen?

WELKER: Mr. Steyer, millions of working Americans are finding that housing has become unaffordable, especially in metropolitan areas. It is particularly acute in your home state of California, in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Why are you the best person to fix this problem?

STEYER: When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing. Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life. It determines where your kids go to school. It determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work.

What we've seen in California is, as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units. And that affects everybody in California. It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents which affect every single working person in the state of California.

I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units.

But the other thing that's going to be true about building these units is, we're going to have to build them in a way that's sustainable, that, in fact, how we build units, where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability.

So we are going to have to direct dollars, we're going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who have worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we're going to have force it, and then we're going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50 percent of their income on rent.

WELKER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Warren, I see your hand raised.

WARREN: Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side, and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing.

Also, private developers, they've gone up to McMansions. They're not building the little two bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers.

So I've got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who are coming back from being incarcerated. It's about tenants' rights.

But there's one more piece. Housing is how we build wealth in America. The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people you're cut out of the deal. That was known as red-lining.

When I built a housing plan, it's not only a housing plan about building new units. It's a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government-sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it, and we need to say we're going to reverse it.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. Senator Booker?

(APPLAUSE)

BOOKER: I'm so grateful, again, as a mayor who was a mayor during a recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis, who started my career as a tenants' rights lawyer, these are all good points, but we're not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification and low-income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation.

And so all these things we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we've got to start empowering people. We use our tax code to move wealth up, the mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If you're a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you're paying and the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners.

And what that does is it actually slashes poverty, 10 million people out. And by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord, it is also low-income families struggling to stay in their homes.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator.

Rachel?

MADDOW: We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back with these candidates from the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate in Atlanta, Georgia. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MADDOW: Welcome back to the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate. Let's get right back into it.

American farmers are struggling under the effects of President Trump's trade war with China. The Trump administration's payments to farmers to offset those losses already have a price tag that is more than double what was spent on the Obama administration's auto bailout.

Mayor Buttigieg, would you continue those farm subsidies?

BUTTIGIEG: We shouldn't have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn't have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago, I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.

By the way, this isn't even making farmers whole. If you're in soybeans, for example, you're getting killed. And it's not just what this president has done with the trade war. In a lot of parts of the country, the worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers, which are killing those who are involved in ethanol.

Look, I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team, but more and more I'm talking to people in rural America who see that they're not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.

I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers, but we have to stand up for them, not just with direct subsidies and support, but with making sure we do something about the consolidation, the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to.

And American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change. I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country. And it's an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution, including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging they're part of the problem.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to answer the question. Would you continue those subsidies or not?

BUTTIGIEG: Yes, but we won't need them because we're going to fix the trade war.

MADDOW: Thank you, sir.

The U.N. recently reported that what was once called climate change is now a climate crisis, with drastic results already being felt. Climate is also an issue important to our audience. We received thousands of questions from our viewers, and many of them were about climate.

Calista from Minneapolis writes this. Leading the world in resolving the climate crisis will be a multi-decade project, spanning far beyond even a two-term presidency. If you are elected president, how would you ensure that there is secure leadership and bipartisan support to continue this project?

Congresswoman Gabbard?

GABBARD: This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue. This is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face. These are the kinds of conversations that we're having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents coming together, saying, hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we're able to raise our kids in a community that's safe.

It is the hyper-partisanship in Washington, unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I would bring about as president, transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry, instead investing in a green renewable energy economy that leads us into the 21st century with good-paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure, and transitioning our agriculture -- that is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face -- towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and well-being of our people, leading as a -- as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.

MADDOW: Thank you. Thank you, Congresswoman. I want to bring in Mr. Steyer on this. You've made climate change a central point of your political career. To this issue of making change -- changes that last, making changes that are permanent, could you address that, sir?

STEYER: Rachel, I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number-one priority for me. Vice President Biden won't say it. Senator Warren won't say it. It's a state of emergency, and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency.

I know that we have to do this. I've spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies, stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this.

I would make this the number-one priority of my foreign policy, as well. We can do this and create literally millions of good-paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low-income black and brown communities. And when we ask, how are we going to pull this country together, how about this: We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world, and we do it together. Do you think that would pull America together? I do.

MADDOW: Quickly, Vice President Biden, you were name-checked there. I'd like to give you a chance to respond.

BIDEN: Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It's the number-one issue. And I might add, I don't really need a kind of a lecture from -- from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that PolitiFact said was a game-changer, while I managed the $90 billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we've ever done it, my friend was introducing more coal mines and produced more coal around the world, according to the press, than all of Great Britain produces.

Now, he's -- I welcome him back into the fold here, and he's been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let's get this straight. I think it is the existential threat of all time.

(CROSSTALK)

STEYER: Can I respond to that, Rachel?

MADDOW: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You may respond, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: Look, I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and it was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels. Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels. And we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago.

If we're waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills -- and I know everybody on this stage cares about this. But Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever. This is a problem which continues to get worse. That's why I'm saying it's a state of emergency. That's why I'm saying it's priority one. If it isn't priority one, it's not going to get done.

And this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront. We have to make it the most important thing. And we can use it to rebuild and reimagine what the United States is. We can be the moral leaders of the world again, while we clean up our air and water and create millions of good-paying jobs.

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, I'm going to ask you to jump in here.

WARREN: I was also named in that.

SANDERS: Tom, you stated...

MADDOW: You were.

SANDERS: You talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency. I've introduced legislation to just do that.

Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question, because your question has said, what are we going to do in decades? We don't have decades. What the scientists are telling us, if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we're talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances.

The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come there are going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world.

What we have got to do tonight, and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable, because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet, and maybe we should think about prosecuting them, as well.

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

Andrea?

MITCHELL: President Trump has dramatically changed America's approach to our adversaries by holding summits with Kim Jong Un, getting out of the Iran nuclear deal, and at times embracing Vladimir Putin and other strongmen. So let's talk about what kind of commander-in-chief you would be.

Senator Harris, North Korea is now threatening to cancel any future summits if President Trump does not make concessions on nuclear weapons. If you were commander-in-chief, would you make concessions to Kim Jong-un in order to keep those talks going?

HARRIS: With all due deference to the fact that this is presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked. He was -- he has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander-in-chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland.

(APPLAUSE)

And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation -- and therefore, an extension of our ability to be secure -- is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.

What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.

MITCHELL: But would you make concessions to North Korea to keep talks...

HARRIS: Not at this point. There are no concessions to be made. They -- he has traded a photo-op for nothing. He has abandoned the -- by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year-and-a-half, so those operations, which should be -- and those exercises, which should be active, because they are in our best national security, the relationship that we have with Japan, he has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea's nuclear program.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

Mr. Vice President, President Trump inherited the North Korea problem from past presidents, over decades. What would a President Biden do that President Obama didn't do in eight years?

BIDEN: Well, first of all, I'd go back in making sure we had the alliances we had before since he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea. He has given North Korea everything they wanted, creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jong-un, who's a thug -- although he points out that I'm a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick, very recently was his comment.

SANDERS: But other than that, you like him.

BIDEN: Other than that, I like him.

(LAUGHTER)

And in Japan and Australia, and being a Pacific power, and putting pressure on China in order -- for them to make sure that it is a non -- it is a nuclear-free peninsula. And the way we do that is, we make clear to China, which I have done personally with -- with the president of China, and that is we're going to move up our defenses, we're going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea, and if they view that as a threat, it's an easy thing to respond to. They, in fact, can, in fact, put pressure on North Korea.

But the fact is that we're in a position where he has done this across the world. He's embraced thugs. Look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is -- his whole effort is to break up NATO, to increase his power. Look what he's done to -- and so this guy has no idea what he's doing. He has no notion how to go about it. And we need a commander-in-chief who when he stands everybody knows what he or she is talking about.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

Two more U.S. soldiers were killed today in Afghanistan tragically in America's longest war. Senator Sanders, you've long said you wanted to bring the troops back home from Afghanistan. Would you cut a deal with the Taliban to end the war, even if it means the collapse of the Afghan government that America has long supported?

SANDERS: Well, let me just say this. One of the big differences between the vice president and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it. And not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War, as well.

And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are, that we don't have to spend ten -- more than -- more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined.

But to answer your question, yeah, I think it is time after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars, which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region, it is time to bring our troops home.

But unlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at 3 o'clock in the morning. I will do it working with the international community. And if it's necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, of course we will do that. But at the end of the day, we have to rethink the entire war on terror, which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives, not only for our own men and women in the armed forces, but for people in that region, as well.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

Ashley?

PARKER: Thank you. Mr. Yang, if you win the 2020 election, what would you say in your first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin?

(LAUGHTER)

YANG: Well, first, I'd say I'm sorry I beat your guy.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

WARREN: It's a sorry, not sorry.

YANG: Or not sorry.

(LAUGHTER)

And, second, I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression. The American people would back me on this. We know that they've found an underbelly and they've been clawing at it, and it's made it so that we can't even trust our own democracy.

The third thing I would say is that we're going to live up to our international commitments. We're going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances, including NATO. And it was James Mattis that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy, the less you have to spend on ammunition.

That has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus not just against Russia, but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on China, in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities, and what's going on in Hong Kong.

I want to propose a new world data organization, like a WTO for data, because right now, unfortunately, we're living in a world where data is the new oil and we don't have our arms around it. These are the ways that we'll actually get Russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

(APPLAUSE)

Rachel?

MADDOW: On the issue of China, Senator Booker, China is now using force against demonstrators in Hong Kong where millions have taken to the streets advocating for democratic reforms. Many of the demonstrators are asking the United States for help. If you were president, would the U.S. help their movement, and how?

BOOKER: Well, first of all, this is president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and, in fact, attacking them, as well. We used a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. And so at the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer, and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies we would need to show strength against China.

There's a larger battle going on, on the planet Earth right now between totalitarian, dictatorial countries and free democracies. And we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government, with its leader now getting rid of even his -- getting rid of term limits.

And so I believe we need a much stronger policy, one that's not led, as President Trump seems to want to do, in a transactional way, but one that's led by American values. So, yes, we will call China out for its human rights violations.

But not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights. Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. It's a human right violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization for the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with and begin to check China, check Putin, and the other folks that are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator. Andrea?

MITCHELL: Mr. Vice President, the CIA has concluded that the leader of Saudi Arabia directed the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department also says the Saudi government is responsible for executing nonviolent offenders and for torture. President Trump has not punished senior Saudi leaders. Would you?

BIDEN: Yes, and I said it at the time. Khashoggi was, in fact, murdered and dismembered, and I believe on the order of the crown prince. And I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them, we were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. There's very little social redeeming value of the -- in the present government in Saudi Arabia.

And I would also, as pointed out, I would end -- end subsidies that we have, end the sale of material to the Saudis where they're going in and murdering children, and they're murdering innocent people. And so they have to be held accountable.

And with regard to China, we should -- look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China, what they're doing with the million Uighurs that are there, essentially in concentration camps in the west. We should be vocally, vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong. We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights.

MITCHELL: Senator Klobuchar, just to follow up, would you go against the Saudis, even though that would potentially help Iran, their adversaries?

KLOBUCHAR: We need a new foreign policy in this country, and that means renewing our relationships with our allies. It means rejoining international agreements. And it means reasserting our American values.

And so when the president did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the country that -- across the world that that was OK, and that's wrong.

And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said, first of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene, but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia and we must start negotiating, even though they were cheating, for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the New START Treaty.

And when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long term, like I do, just like the Chinese do, because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet, and they are in it for the long game.

MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: I think I may have been the first person up here to make it clear that Saudi Arabia not only murdered Khashoggi, but this is a brutal dictatorship which does everything it can to crush democracy, treats women as third-class citizens. And when we rethink our American foreign policy, what we have got to know is that Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally.

We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say we are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts.

And by the way, the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer good enough for us simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel. But we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve.

(APPLAUSE)

What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is 70 percent or 80 percent, is unsustainable. So we need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with the United Nations, and not continue to support brutal dictatorships.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator. Rachel?

MADDOW: Senator Warren, only about 1 percent of Americans serve in the United States military right now. Should that number be higher?

WARREN: Yes, I think it should be. You know, all three of my brothers served in the military. One was career military. The other two also served. I think it's an important part of who we are as Americans. And I think the notion of shared service is important.

It's how we help bring our nation together. It's how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently. It's also about how families share that sacrifice.

I remember what it was like when I was a little girl. My brother, my oldest brother, who served five-and-a-half years off and on in combat in Vietnam, what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed? How is he doing? And if there was a letter, she was brighter than the day. And if there wasn't, she would say, well, maybe tomorrow.

This is about building for our entire nation. And I believe we should do that. I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country. So, for example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in 10,000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change. We can do this as a nation.

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator. In President Trump's first two years in office, the Pentagon budget ballooned. Mayor Buttigieg, would you cut military spending? Or would you keep it on the same upward trajectory?

BUTTIGIEG: We need to re-prioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular. It's not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway growth in military spending. It's also where.

Right now, we are spending a fraction of the attention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now. If we fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building just turned into bigger targets.

We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president. After all, he's relying on 17th century security technologies, like a moat full of alligators or a big wall.

(LAUGHTER)

There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian, diplomatic, and military security work needs to take place for the future.

BOOKER: Can I respond?

MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.

WARREN: Could I respond on this?

WELKER: Coming up, we will have much more from the candidates. We're going to take a quick break, just a moment. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WELKER: Welcome back, everyone, to the fifth Democratic debate. Let's move now to the issue of race in America. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently told Congress, quote, ""The majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by white supremacist violence.""

Congresswoman Gabbard, to you. As president, would you direct the federal government to do something about this problem that it is not currently doing?

GABBARD: Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness, and attacks that unfortunately have taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It’s important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country, beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty.

This is something that I'll do as president and commander-in-chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system, working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs, end the money bail system, enact the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past.

The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, orientation, and our politics. That kind of leadership starts at the top. As president, I will usher in a 21st century White House that actually represents the interests of all Americans, first and foremost.

WELKER: Congresswoman Gabbard, thank you for that.

Mr. Yang, what would you do about the issue of white supremacist violence?

YANG: Well, first, we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the Department of Justice can properly measure it.

(APPLAUSE)

I talked to an anti-hate activist named Christian Picciolini who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10-year period. He said he was a lonely 14-year-old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade. Now he's out and he's helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society.

But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt, broken 14-year-old boy, he would have gone with them. He said if it had been a coach, I would have gone with him, if it had been a mentor or a teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.

So what we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks. And when you look at gun violence in this country, 96 percent-plus of the shooters we're talking about are young boys and young men. We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy, strong young men who do not hate, but instead feel like they have paths forward in today's economy.

WELKER: Mr. Yang, thank you for that.

Vice President Biden, the ""Me, Too"" movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take early in your administration to address this problem?

BIDEN: Yes. And by the way, it's one of the reasons -- the first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I wrote. The fact -- I didn't write the reauthorization. I wrote the original act.

The fact is that what happens now is that we, in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated. That's why as vice president -- and when I asked the president, I could start the movement on the college campuses to say it's on us. It's everyone's responsibility.

We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with -- I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30,000 people were on the call, young people between 15 and 25, and found out I said, what do you need -- what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and on your schools? You know what they said? Get men involved, engage the rest of the community.

And that's when we started this movement on the college campuses to fundamentally change the culture. No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, other than in self-defense, and that's -- rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it. It will be a big -- no, I really mean it. It's a gigantic issue. And we have to make it clear from the top, from the president on down, that we will not tolerate it. We will not tolerate this culture.

WELKER: Mr. Vice President, thank you.

Senator Harris, this week, you criticized Mayor Pete Buttigieg's outreach to African-American voters. You said, quote, ""The Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are, as the diversity of the American people,"" end quote. What exactly prompted you to say that, Senator Harris?

HARRIS: Well, I was asked a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published. But, listen, I think that it really speaks to a larger issue, and I'll speak to the larger issue. I believe that the mayor has made apologies for that.

The larger issue is that for too long I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies and have -- you know, they show up when it's, you know, close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote, but just haven't been there before.

I mean, you know, the -- there are plenty of people who applauded black women for the success of the 2018 election, applauded black women for the election of a senator from Alabama. But, you know, at some point, folks get tired of just saying, oh, you know, thank me for showing up and -- and say, well, show up for me.

Because when black women...

(APPLAUSE)

When black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America, when the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death, when black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women, who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be, where you been? And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?

(APPLAUSE)

And I'm running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks. And we've got to re-create the Obama coalition to win. And that means about women, that's people of color, that's our LGBTQ community, that's working people, that's our labor unions. But that is how we are going to win this election, and I intend to win.

WELKER: Senator Harris, thank you.

Mayor Buttigieg, your response to that.

BUTTIGIEG: My response is, I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me.

And before I share what's in my plans, let me talk about what's in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built-up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.

I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society.

And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.

WELKER: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE)

Senator Harris, quick response?

HARRIS: Look, there's a lot at stake in this election, and I've said it many times, I think justice is on the ballot in 2020. And it's about economic justice. It's about justice for children. It's about justice for our teachers. I could go on down the list.

And so the issue really is not what is the fight. The issue has to be, how are we going to win? And to win, we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because that's the last time we won.

And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities, and has the ability to bring people together. And everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and, therefore, ability to bring folks together around our commonalities, of which I believe there are many.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Warren, quickly?

WARREN: So I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we're willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Senator Harris rightly raised the question of economic justice.

Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now in America, African-Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they're in college, and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out, 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94 percent of them have paid off their student loan debt, 5 percent of African-Americans have paid it off.

I believe that means everyone on this stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness. It will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let's do something tangible and real to make change in this country.

WELKER: Senator Warren, thank you. Ashley?

PARKER: Senator Warren, back to you. You've said that the border wall that President Trump has proposed is, quote, ""a monument to hate and division."" Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation's southern border?

WARREN: If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border.

Trump is the one who has created this crisis, and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid. That means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity.

You know, when I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border. I went down there immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. There's like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys.

I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers, and she told me she'd given a drink to a police officer and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border.

We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect. A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Booker, a quick response.

BOOKER: Look, I want to be quick on this because I'd like to get back to something I wasn't included in, is...

WARREN: So would we all.

BOOKER: Absolutely, if this is not effective, we see people cutting holes in this wall, his wall, the way he brags about it, it's just wrong. We need to have policies that respect dignity, keep us safe and strong.

I wanted to return back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters; I've been one since I was 18.

(LAUGHTER)

Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off, and they're worried. They're pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote. And they're worried because the Democratic Party, we don't want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that doesn't -- isn't trusted, doesn't have authentic connection.

And so that’s what’s on the ballot. And issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the vice president. He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week, I hear him literally say that I don’t think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might have been high when you said it.

(LAUGHTER)

And let me tell you, because -- because marijuana -- marijuana -- marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it's -- the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.

(APPLAUSE)

And so let me just -- let me just say this. With more African-Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children, because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people -- our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes.

(APPLAUSE)

And so these are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community. And if we don't have somebody authentically -- we lost the last election. Let me just give you this data example.

PARKER: Quickly. Quickly, please.

BOOKER: We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive diminution -- a lot of reasons, but there was a massive diminution in the African-American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator Booker. Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.

BIDEN: I'll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think everyone -- anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged, be completely zeroed out.

But I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana. That's all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.

Secondly, I'm -- you know, I'm part of that Obama coalition. I come out of a black community, in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus, the only African-American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people...

HARRIS: No, that's not true.

BOOKER: That's not true.

HARRIS: The other one is here.

(LAUGHTER)

BIDEN: No, I said the first. I said the first African-American woman. The first African-American woman.

(LAUGHTER)

So my point is -- my point is that one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship, longstanding relationship with the black community. I was part of that coalition.

PARKER: Thank you. Kristen?

WELKER: And we do have to take another quick break, but we are going to hear much more from the candidates when we come right back here in Atlanta, Georgia. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MADDOW: Welcome back to the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate. Many states, including right here where we are tonight in Georgia, have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion. Right now, Roe v. Wade protects a woman's right to abortion nationwide. But if Roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states, would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back?

Senator Klobuchar?

KLOBUCHAR: Well, of course. We should codify Roe v. Wade into law. That is what we should do.

(APPLAUSE)

And this president indicated early on what he was going to do, and he's done it. When he was running for office, he literally said women should go to jail. Then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail. So no surprise that we're seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, in Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills.

And what we have to remember is that the people are with us. And I predict this will be a big election -- issue in the general election. And I just can't wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him. You know what? The people are with us. Over 70 percent of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90 percent of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the health care they need.

(APPLAUSE)

He is off the track on this, and he will hear from the women of America, and this is how we're going to win this election.

MADDOW: Just this weekend, Louisiana re-elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. He has signed one of the country's toughest laws restricting abortion. Is there room in the Democratic Party for someone like him, someone who can win in a deep red state but who does not support abortion rights?

Senator Warren?

WARREN: Look, I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party.

Understand this. When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It's just going to fall hard on poor women. It's going to fall hard on girls, women who don't even know that they're pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance.

And I know it can be a hard decision for people. But here's the thing. When it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother, she should be able to call on her partner, she should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi. But the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Senator Warren, I'm going to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question. Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana is an anti-abortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in Louisiana. Is there room for him in the Democratic Party with those politics?

WARREN: I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for. I'm not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. I'm not here to try to build fences. But I am here to say, this is what I will fight for as president of the United States. The women of America can count on that.

MADDOW: Senator Warren, thank you. Senator Sanders, I'll give you 30 seconds.

SANDERS: Let me just -- Amy mentioned that women feel strongly on it. Well, let me just tell you that if there's ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women, this is the moment.

(APPLAUSE)

And I get very tired, very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say get the government off our backs, we want small government. Well, if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians.

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you.

BOOKER: This is a voting issue.

MADDOW: Senator Booker?

BOOKER: This is a voting issue. This is a voter suppression issue. Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African-American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams right now.

(APPLAUSE)

And that is, when you have undemocratic means, when you suppress people's votes to get elected, those are the very people you're going to come after when you're in office. And this bill, opposed by over 70 percent -- the heartbeat bill here -- opposed by over 70 percent of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression. This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day, that whoever is the nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low-income and minority voters, and particularly in the black community, like we saw here in Georgia.

MADDOW: Senator Booker, thank you.

And to that point, individual states, as you all know, set their own rules for voting and for elections. Depending on where you live, you may be required to show ID or not. You might have a lot of days for early voting or fewer days or none. You might have a polling place in walking distance or you might have to drive or take a bus to the edge of town.

With that in mind, our next question comes from Jenna in Maryland, who asks, what will you do at the executive level to ensure that every American has equal access to the ballot box?

Mayor Buttigieg?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century, because this affects every other issue that we care about. Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro-democracy, anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell's hands in the United States Senate.

We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, Election Day a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote and, in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of elections before the voting even begins.

Right now, we have politicians picking out their voters, rather than the other way around. That compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.

KLOBUCHAR: I just -- I want to add this...

BUTTIGIEG: And while these process issues are not always fashionable, we must act to reform our democracy itself, including when it comes to choosing our presidency...

(CROSSTALK)

MADDOW: Senator Klobuchar...

BUTTIGIEG: ... like we do in every other election, giving it to the person who got the most votes.

KLOBUCHAR: I want to point out...

(CROSSTALK)

KLOBUCHAR: I agree with what the mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience and of leading 11 of the bills that are in that House-passed bill you just referred to.

And I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I've got to the Senate. And I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task, a bipartisan bill to say, yeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how they're paid for, and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don't have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill. And I am so close to getting it done. And the way I get it done is if I'm president.

But just like I have won statewide and mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.

MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, I'll let you respond to that.

BUTTIGIEG: So, first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?

I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces, and our marriages. And I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Congresswoman Gabbard, on the original question of voting rights, please.

GABBARD: Thank you. I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. I've introduced legislation called the Securing Americas Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voter's voice is heard.

But I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comments about experience. Pete, you'll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander-in-chief. I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.

As commander-in-chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience, serving for seven years in Congress, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands...

MADDOW: Congresswoman, thank you.

GABBARD: ... dealing with high-level national security briefings, understanding what's necessary, the preparation that I've gotten to walk in on day one to serve as commander-in-chief.

MADDOW: Congresswoman, thank you. Mr. Mayor, I'll allow you to respond.

BUTTIGIEG: So I've got to respond to that. I know that it's par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today's politics.

GABBARD: Are you saying that you didn't say that?

BUTTIGIEG: I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We've been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?

(LAUGHTER)

GABBARD: That's not what I said. That's not what I said.

BUTTIGIEG: I'm talking about building up -- I'm talking about building up alliances. And if your question is about experience, let's also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad. I have in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not since it wasn't accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Congresswoman Gabbard, let me allow you to respond.

GABBARD: Thank you. You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes. The fact-checkers can check this out.

BUTTIGIEG: No.

GABBARD: But your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander-in-chief does need to have good judgment. And what you've just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.

BUTTIGIEG: Like Donald Trump who met with Kim.

GABBARD: Like Reagan, who met -- like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev. These issues of national security are incredibly important. I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm's way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security. I'll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Congresswoman Gabbard...

BUTTIGIEG: I've got to respond to this. This is a direct...

(CROSSTALK)

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, I'm going to have you respond.

SANDERS: To your original point, the American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt. And it is not just voter suppression, which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying black people and people of color the right to vote, but we also have a system through Citizens United which allows billionaires to buy elections.

So what we need to do, simple and straightforward, in every state in this country through the federal government, if you are 18, you have a right to vote, end of discussion.

(APPLAUSE)

We have to overturn Citizens United. We need to move toward public funding of elections.

MADDOW: On this last point, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: I agree exactly with what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how we're going to win in 2020. I don't mean to change the subject, but I think it's sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020 but have a sweeping victory across the country. And what that's going to mean is turnout.

In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don't vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth, no one deals with my issues, the system is broken, why would we vote?

But what we've found at NextGen America is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. And if you look at 2018 and flipping the House, what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three-quarters. In the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people, the turnout went up by more than 100 percent, more than double.

MADDOW: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: So for us to win, for everybody on this stage, for whoever's the candidate, to have a Senate that's Democratic, for us to have the sweeping victory that we absolutely...

MADDOW: Mr. Steyer, thank you.

STEYER: ... are going to have next year, it's a turnout question. We're going to have to tell the truth and we're going to have organize across this country.

MADDOW: Thank you very much.

SANDERS: Exactly right. That's exactly right.

MADDOW: It is time -- at this point, it is well past time, if I'm honest, to start closing statements. And we are going to start tonight with Senator Booker. The floor is yours.

BOOKER: Thank you, Rachel. It's an honor to be here tonight.

I have not yet qualified for the December stage and need your help to do that. If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to corybooker.com. Please help.

I had a closing statement prepared, but I saw in the audience during the break a man named John Lewis. And perhaps it's interesting and important for me to mention why I'm so grateful to him.

I've been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way, by bringing people together to create transformative change, not just beat Donald Trump. That's the floor. We need to go to the ceiling. We need to go to the mountaintop.

I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago there was a lawyer on a couch who changed his life, changed his mind to get up and start representing families, one of them mine, who were discriminated against. The house I grew up in is because of that lawyer's activity.

When I asked him why, why he did what he did, he told me that on March 7, 1965, he was watching a movie called ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" on TV and they interrupted that movie to show a bridge in Alabama called the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And there he saw John Lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by Alabama state troopers.

We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again, that we have truly a moral moment in America, like it was back in 1965.

If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble. I will challenge us. I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before, because we...

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.

BOOKER: ... need to mobilize a new American movement. Keep me on this stage. Keep me on this race. It is time we fight and fight together. Please go to corybooker.com.

MADDOW: Senator Booker, thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Mr. Steyer, your closing statement.

STEYER: Last time I was on this stage, I started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the White House. And I stand by that statement.

But I'm different from everybody else on this stage. I know that the government in Washington, D.C., is broken. I know that it's been purchased by corporations. And I've spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations.

I'm the only one on this stage who's willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself, term limits, that if we're going to make bold changes, we're going to need new and different people in charge. I'm the only person on this stage who spent decades building an international business. Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr. Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy, talk about growth, understand that we can make Mr. Trump what he is, a fraud and a failure, on the economy, which is his strong point.

I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority, that it's our biggest challenge, but it's our biggest opportunity to recreate this country.

If you want to beat Mr. Trump, if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government, if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants, I'm the person who can do it.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: I have spent a decade trusting the American people...

(LAUGHTER)

MITCHELL: Thank -- thank -- thank you, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: I'm asking you to trust me.

MITCHELL: Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Congresswoman Gabbard, go ahead.

GABBARD: My personal commitment to you, to all of my fellow Americans, is to treat you with respect and compassion, something that we in Hawaii called aloha. Every single person deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of race, religion, or gender, or even your politics. Inclusion, unity, respect, aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration.

Now, Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959, where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the aloha spirit. He said we look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice, where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country. He later went on to say, as I looked out at the various faces and various colors mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.

Working side by side, let's defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump, come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace, inclusion, and true equality, working side by side. Let's make Dr. King's dream our reality.

PARKER: Thank you, Congresswoman.

WELKER: Mr. Yang, your turn.

YANG: I'm here with my wife, Evelyn, tonight. We have two young boys, Christopher and Damian. How many of you all are parents like us here in the room?

So if you're a parent, you've had this thought. Maybe you've been afraid to express it. And it is this: Our kids are not all right. They're not all right because we're leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents.

We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history, the fourth industrial revolution, and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side. We talk as if Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems. He is not. He is a symptom. And we need to cure the disease.

Now, my first move was not to run for president of the United States, because I am not insane.

(LAUGHTER)

My first move was to go to D.C., talk to our leaders and say technology is ripping us apart, immigrants are being scapegoated, our kids are being left behind, and the American dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes. And the people in Washington, D.C., had nothing for this. They don't want to touch it. They don't want to talk about an issue they don't think they have a solution for.

I'm not running for president because I fantasized about being president. I'm running for president because, like many of you here in this room tonight, I'm a parent and a patriot and I have seen the future that we're leaving for our kids, and it is not something I'm willing to accept.

We need to create a new way forward for our people. If you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy, go to yang2020.com and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them, and believe it: Your country loves you, your country values you, and you will be all right.

WELKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

MADDOW: Senator Klobuchar?

KLOBUCHAR: The nation was riveted this week by the testimony in Washington. One of the people we heard from yesterday was Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. And what he said was -- as he spoke to his immigrant father and he said, in this country, you can tell the truth and it's going to be fine. It reminded me of Army counsel years and years ago in the McCarthy hearing, someone from Iowa, actually, Mr. Welch, who said, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir?""

I want us to remember that this election is, yes, an economic check on this president, and I have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of health care, yes.

But this is also a patriotism check, a value check, a decency check. And when you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didn't vote in 2016, African-Americans are turning out like we didn't see before. But we also -- and they must be with us, and we must get our fired-up Democratic base with us.

But we also, let's get those independents and moderate Republicans who cannot stomach this guy anymore. This is how we build a coalition, so we don't just beat Donald Trump. We bring the U.S. Senate to some sense. We send Mitch McConnell packing. This is how we win.

So if you want to join us -- and remember that this won't be for me a personal victory, it will be a national victory, of someone that wins in red districts and suburban, purple districts, and bright blue districts every single time. If you want to join us and if you believe that our work doesn't end on Election Day, but begins on Inauguration Day, join us, amyklobuchar.com.

MADDOW: Senator Klobuchar, thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Senator Harris?

HARRIS: So, we're in a fight. This is a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. And it's a fight we need to win.

And to fight this fight, I believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe to toe with Donald Trump -- and I have taken on Jeff Sessions, I've taken on Bill Barr, I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh. I know I have the ability to do that.

We also need someone who can unify the party and the country and who has the experience of having done that. I've done that work. I believe we need someone who has the ability to speak to all the people regardless of their race, their gender, their party affiliation, where they live geographically or the language their grandmother speaks.

My entire career has been spent having one client and one client only: the people. I have never represented a corporation. I've never represented a special interest. And in this election, justice and the various injustices people are facing regardless of where they live or their race or gender are very much on the ballot, from economic justice to reproductive justice to health care justice to educational justice.

And I truly believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will then unlock the potential of the American people and the promise of America, and that's the America I believe in. That's the America I see. And that is why I'm running for president.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator Harris.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Mayor Buttigieg, go ahead.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, I want to remark that we're in the city of Atlanta, a city where a great local leader, Maynard Jackson, helped create the black middle class that Atlanta is known by, by ensuring that taxpayer dollars were spent in a way that reflected the need to expand opportunity to those who were excluded.

And just as local leaders have shown great leadership, we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this, expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country.

I'm not only running to defeat Donald Trump. I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office, to launch the era that must come after Trump. That era must be characterized not by exclusion, but by belonging. And so must our campaign.

I am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues we've been talking about tonight all along, moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition, and a lot of future former Republicans, who I know are watching this, disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country. I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create.

I hope you go to peteforamerica.com, join this effort, and help us create a better era for the American people beginning in November 2020.

PARKER: Thank you.

WELKER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: Thank you. Let me say a word about myself, unusual as it may seem.

(LAUGHTER)

I am the son of an immigrant, young man of 17 who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. I have some sense of the immigrant experience. I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.

At the age of 21, as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago, I was arrested, spent the night in jail, and I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination -- racial discrimination, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and religious bigotry. I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness brought by Trump, and bring us together.

During this campaign, I am proud to say that I have received more campaign contributions than any candidate at this point in an election in American history, over 4 million contributions, averaging $18 apiece.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Senator Warren, the floor is yours.

WARREN: So, thank you. You know, I've listened to this debate tonight and I hear a lot of really good ideas. But I take a look at the issues we've talked about. We've talked about climate change. We've talked about defense spending. We've talked about private health insurance. We should have talked about gun violence.

What do these issues have in common? Well, first, they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. And what is the second thing they have in common? We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it, and the majority of Americans are with us on it, and yet we don't make change. Why not?

Because of corruption. Because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription. It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms instead of into our public schools. We have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else.

I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. It involves ending lobbying as we know it, blocking the revolving door between industry and Washington, making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online.

(APPLAUSE)

We have to have the courage not to make just individual changes, not to fight for little pieces. We want to make real progress on climate. Then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country.

I am so grateful to be here and I am grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a chance to become a college professor, a chance to become a United States senator...

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.

WARREN: ... and a chance to become candidate for president of the United States. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Vice President Biden, your closing statement.

BIDEN: I assume we're only talking about the corruption of the federal government. We weren't talking about Barack Obama and his spotless administration who made so much progress.

But one thing we haven't talked about here today, we haven't talked -- we talked about everything, but we haven't talked about the one thing I think is most consequential.

You know, the American people have an enormous opportunity. There's an incredible -- incredible -- I've never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career, and I got elected when I was a 29-year-old kid to the United States Senate.

Folks, we are in a position where we have -- we're the wealthiest nation in the world, our workers are more productive than workers around the world, three times as productive as workers in Asia. We have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined. We're in a position where we've led not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.

I'm so tired of everybody walking around like woe is me, what are we going to do? Let's remember, this is the United States of America. There has never, ever, ever been a time when we have set our mind to do something we've been unable to do it. Never. Never, never.

So it's time to remember, get up, let's take back this country and lead the world again. It's within our power to do it. Get up and take it back.

(APPLAUSE)

The Supreme Court is reviewing the Trump administration’s effort to end the program.

AD

Trump made immigration — and the demonization of immigrants who came to the country illegally — a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and of his presidency, so Vela is surprised that Democrats have not made countering his message one of their top priorities, something deeply discussed at every debate, like health care.

AD

“What is going to happen with young individuals who didn’t qualify for DACA? What’s going to happen to the people who have been waiting in line for 20 years?” said Vela, 24, a college student who is studying political science. “Our immigration system is broken. It’s outdated. It’s not working. What are they going to do?”

As they watched Democrats churn through another event in the lengthy process of picking a presidential nominee, Vela and other young Latino voters with whom she watched the debate said they often feel forgotten. The first two nominating states, Iowa and New Hampshire, have overwhelmingly white populations; the fourth, South Carolina, has a large number of African American voters. The third voting state, Nevada, will highlight Latinos but has gotten far less attention from the candidates than the other three.

Most campaigns have not spent the time and money to fully engage Latino voters, who participate in elections at much lower rates than whites or African Americans. In Georgia, about 2 percent of voters in 2018 were Latino, even though Latinos make up about 10 percent of the population.

AD

AD

“There have been so many years of false promises where we have been let down by both parties,” Vela said. “When it comes to election time, we are used as a platform and then there’s nothing.”

The watch party she attended was organized by Latino Democratic Party leaders and held at Mariscos Mazatlan, a seafood grill in a suburban shopping plaza about 30 miles northeast of the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, where the debate was held. The restaurant, known for its ceviche and tropical drinks, is in the Pleasant Hill Plaza, home to a sprawling East Asian grocery store and restaurants serving Filipino cuisine, Peruvian burgers, Vietnamese pho, Colombian chicken, bubble tea, Korean barbecue, crepes and hibachi fare.

The gathering attracted about a dozen Latino 20-somethings, plus a young woman who came to the United States as a refu­gee from Bosnia, the son of Vietnamese immigrants, a handful of activists who work on immigrant rights issues, and a 55-year-old African American criminal defense lawyer who is running for district attorney in Gwinnett County.

It was the first time Jasmin Alvarez had watched a debate, and she was surprised the candidates spent so much time “throwing each other under the bus.” The 24-year-old has never voted but plans to do so next year. She has yet to pick a favorite candidate — or decide which candidates she doesn’t like — so the debate offered a sweeping introduction to the field.

Alvarez was thrilled to hear candidates asked to talk about lowering the cost of child care, the lack of paid parental leave and the gender pay gap, which is largest for Latinas. Those questions prompted snaps of approval from many Latinas and were opportunities for Alvarez to share her experiences with the young Latino activist sitting next to her.

“It’s true,” she said of the gender pay gap, adding that she works at an e-commerce company that started her at $10 per hour and then later hired some young men at $12 per hour. “They gave me a ‘raise,’ and I was like, ‘This isn’t a raise.’ ”

More than an hour into the debate, the camera panned over the 10 candidates standing on the stage, and one Latina at the restaurant suddenly blurted out: “Wait! Where’s Julián Castro?”

The others told her his polling numbers were too low to qualify. Castro, who served as housing secretary in the Obama administration, was by far the favorite candidate of the group — and everyone insisted it was not because he is the only Latino candidate.

“It’s because he’s the one who has talked about issues that are important to people of color,” said Gabriel Velazquez, 34, who owns the Taqueria El Mercadito in Gainesville, Ga. “If you ignore race, you’re not going to be a candidate for all of us. . . . You look at the top three candidates — a white woman and white men. I don’t say that to diss them, but I can’t ignore that it’s three white candidates.”

AD

AD

Velazquez hesitates to call himself a Democrat, “because both parties have ignored us,” but Trump’s presidency pushed him to get politically involved. He wants to hear Democratic candidates focus on police reform, combating systemic racism and providing reparations to the descendants of slaves, in addition to implementing universal health care through a program like Medicare-for-all. He is concerned that some candidates are easing off their support for Medicare-for-all, after polling showing voters are skeptical about its effects.

His “distant second” choice for president is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), because, he said, she has deeply researched plans backing up her ideas. But other than Castro and Warren, Velazquez said he can’t imagine voting for any of the others — especially if the nominee is a moderate such as former vice president Joe Biden or South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

“People will say: ‘But that means four more years of Trump,’ ” he said, making clear that he does not want that. “That matters to me, but I can’t sit here and give my vote to a candidate who ignores things like racism.”

Several debate-watchers said they were glad to hear the candidates talk about affordable housing, a growing problem in the Atlanta area, and voter suppression, which former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has sought to make a national issue. Throughout the night, several candidates said Democrats need to do more to connect with African Americans, who make up about a third of Georgia’s population, and address racial disparities in health care, pay and criminal justice.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) gave a passionate monologue about why “black voters are pissed off,” saying that politicians seem to pay attention to them only when they are running for office. Booker noted that Biden opposes the legalization of marijuana, which Booker said “is already legal for privileged people” because “the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.”

“Yup! Yup! Yup!” shouted Wesley Person, 55. He is running for district attorney in Gwinnett County against a 27-year incumbent on a platform of making the criminal justice system more equitable. “Cory Booker is right on.”

Other debate-watchers applauded along as Booker spoke, in what amounted to the most animated portion of the night.

AD

Person said his favorite candidate is Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) because of her time as a prosecutor, which he says was not perfect but “started a trend of progressive prosecution.” The lawyer said he has been disappointed with Biden for the same reasons that Booker gave on the debate stage.

AD

“God bless his heart, I think Vice President Biden lives in the past,” Person said, adding that the diverse 20-somethings around him are the future of the party and that leaders need to remember that.

A few minutes before 11 p.m., the restaurant closed for the night — an hour later than usual — and the group moved outside, chatting among themselves as the debate continued. Several people noted the heavy focus on Trump throughout the night.

“The conversation has to move past Trump,” Velazquez said. “We get it — Trump is a liar, Trump is a racist, Trump is a misogynist. But just being against Trump isn’t enough to win.”

THE BIG IDEA: They were there to bat cleanup, but both the GOP’s witnesses on Tuesday afternoon instead provided fresh fodder for the impeachment case against President Trump.

Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, formally requested the testimony of Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, the National Security Council’s former senior director covering Russia and Ukraine.

Neither of the Republicans had any desire to blame the president who appointed them for any misconduct. Both insisted that they didn’t see him do anything illegal. Each seemed content to throw Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, and Gordon Sondland, the megadonor who became ambassador to the European Union and is testifying today, under the bus. But they also validated key testimony from other witnesses, deepened a damning fact pattern for Trump and said that the underlying conduct the president stands accused of would generally be inappropriate.

Volker said he “would have objected” if he knew at the time that Trump brought up Joe Biden repeatedly and specifically during the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. “I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question,” the former envoy proclaimed.

Volker said he drew a line between pushing for an investigation of the company Burisma versus an investigation of Hunter Biden, who once sat on the company’s board. “In retrospect I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,” he testified. “I don’t think raising the 2016 election or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories are … things that we should be pursuing.”

Trump’s former envoy also questioned the credibility of the sources that the former New York mayor seemed to rely on. “The allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and non-credible,” Volker said. “I have known Vice President Biden for 24 years. He is an honorable man, and I hold him in the highest regard.”

Volker said Trump never told him directly that the aid was being withheld unless the Ukrainians announced investigations. He said the president had expressed a “general negative view” of Ukraine that dated back to when he came onboard in 2017. Volker said this perception was somewhat understandable considering the Eastern European nation’s historic struggles with corruption.

But he also painted a picture of himself as out of the loop and unaware of the machinations happening behind the scenes. He said he connected Giuliani with a top aide to the new Ukrainian president because he hoped it would smooth the way for a White House meeting and improved bilateral ties. Eager to defend his own reputation, Volker was adamant that he never personally witnessed or participated in illegal conduct. “I was never involved with anything that I considered to be bribery at all,” he said. “Or extortion.”

-- Both Morrison and Volker said they believe it’s inappropriate for an American president to ask a foreign leader to investigate an American citizen. “I don’t believe it is appropriate for the president to do that,” Volker said in response to a question from Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.). “If we have law enforcement concerns with a U.S. citizen generally, there are appropriate channels for that.” Morrison said he agreed. Then Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) asked about a hypothetical scenario in which a mayor, governor or member of Congress withheld public funds from a law enforcement agency until it investigated his or her political rival. Morrison and Volker agreed that, too, would be improper.

-- Morrison said he reported details of the July 25 call to the National Security Council’s top lawyer. He said he worried about the political fallout if the call became public, not its legality, and insisted he wasn’t personally bothered by anything Trump said. “As I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington’s political climate,” he said. “My fears have been realized.” Morrison also acknowledged that Biden and Burisma were not on the talking points prepared for Trump in advance of the conversation and did not reflect official U.S. policy.

-- Morrison said he had a “sinking feeling” that the money Trump put a freeze on would expire if it wasn’t transferred to Ukraine by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. He noted that this would force the administration to explain to congressional appropriators why there had been a hold in the first place.

-- Morrison also testified that Sondland informed him that he had told a top aide to Volodymyr Zelensky “that the Ukrainians would have to have the prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted.” Under questioning by the Democratic counsel for the Intelligence Committee, Morrison said he was concerned that these were being identified as requirements.

-- Morrison said his predecessor Fiona Hill, who is testifying on Thursday, had warned him about the “Gordon problem,” referring to Sondland, when he took over. “I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing,” he explained. “I didn’t always act on things Gordon suggested [and] that he believed were important.”

-- Volker said he now remembers details of the July 10 meetings at the White House that he had forgotten, or omitted, during his closed-door deposition in October. Last month, he said there was no discussion of Giuliani or investigations and called the conversations uneventful. Other officials who were there have subsequently testified that John Bolton, then the national security adviser, abruptly ended a meeting in his office when Sondland broached the issue of investigations. On Tuesday, Volker said he now remembers that Sondland did, in fact, make “a general comment” about investigations, though he said it happened as the meeting was wrapping up anyway. “I think all of us thought it was inappropriate,” Volker said. “The conversation did not continue, and the meeting concluded.” Volker called it “something of an eye-roll moment.”

Volker said he still does not have any recollection of Sondland bringing up investigations a second time during a follow-up conversation with the visiting Ukrainians in the Ward Room of the White House. “I may have been engaged in a side conversation, or had already left the complex, because I do not recall further discussion regarding investigations or Burisma,” he said in his opening statement.

-- Volker and Morrison appeared together on an afternoon panel after the testimony of Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence’s special adviser on Europe. Williams said she thought the July 25 call was “unusual” because “it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.” She said no one in the national security firmament supported withholding the aid until Trump froze it. Vindman, the National Security Council’s European affairs director, said he considered the president’s request that Ukraine investigate Biden to be “inappropriate.” The Army officer argued that “it is improper” for Trump “to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.”

-- Interestingly, Morrison and Vindman agreed that moving the rough transcript of the July 25 call to a code-word-level server was not a big deal. But they disagreed on why it happened. Morrison said it was a mistake that resulted from an administrative error, but Vindman saw it as a deliberate attempt to hide a sensitive call. Vindman also said the omission of the word Burisma from the rough transcript of the call wasn’t nefarious but the result of the transcription software.

-- The White House issued a statement from Pence’s national security adviser Keith Kellogg that said Williams never “reported any personal or professional concerns” to him, her supervisor, regarding the call. “As an exceedingly proud member of President Trump’s Administration and as a 34-year highly experienced combat veteran who retired with the rank of Lieutenant General in the Army, I heard nothing wrong or improper on the call,” Kellogg said in the statement. “I had and have no concerns.”

MORE TEAM COVERAGE:

-- Sondland is testifying more bluntly this morning than he did during his previous deposition that Trump and Giuliani sought to condition a White House invite for Ukraine’s new president to demands that his country publicly launch investigations that could damage Trump’s political opponents. Aaron Davis reports: “I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo?’” Sondland said in his opening statement. “With regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.”

In his sworn opening statement, Trump’s ambassador also told the House Intelligence Committee that while he never knew for sure if the White House had frozen nearly $400 million in security assistance as part of the pressure campaign against Ukraine, he operated as if that was the case. “In the absence of any credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized,” Sondland said. “My belief was that if Ukraine did something to demonstrate a serious intention” to launch the investigations Trump wanted, “then the hold on military aid would be lifted.”

-- ""Sondland’s future — and possibly his freedom — could also rest on whether lawmakers believe he is telling the whole truth about his role and that of the president,"" Aaron and Rachael Bade report. ""Lawmakers in previous inquiries have referred witnesses to the Justice Department if they believe they have lied under oath.”

-- Here are five question The Fix's Amber Phillips wants Sondland to answer:

Was he acting of his own volition, or at Trump’s direction?

What did he say to Trump – and what did Trump tell him – on a July 26 phone call from Kyiv?

Sondland told the Ukrainians their military aid would come when their president made an “anti-corruption statement.” Was that code for investigations into the Bidens and 2016 election interference?

Why didn’t Sondland remember the offer he gave to the Ukrainians in his original testimony?

Why did he agree to testify?

-- Federal prosecutors scrutinizing Giuliani and two of his associates on Thursday will question a top executive at Ukraine’s state-owned gas company about his encounters with those associates as the pair pursued energy deals in Ukraine. Tom Hamburger and Roz Helderman report: “The executive of the Ukrainian company, Andrew Favorov, an American citizen, agreed to meet with prosecutors for the Southern District of New York who had asked to speak with him about his experiences with the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The pair worked with Giuliani to gather information about the Ukraine-related activities of [Joe and Hunter Biden]. Favorov’s attorney, Lanny Breuer, said his client ‘will voluntarily sit down with the government attorneys.’ Breuer declined to comment further.”

-- A federal judge said she intends to rule no later than the end of Monday whether former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify under subpoena before Congress. The House Judiciary Committee asked for an accelerated decision because it aims to call MGahn when likely writing articles of impeachment against Trump. Spencer Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of Washington entered an order Tuesday about her deadline intent ‘absent unforeseen circumstances’ shortly after a filing from House General Counsel Douglas N. Letter arguing last week’s opening of the hearings before the House Intelligence Committee was grounds for urgency. … William A. Burck, McGahn’s attorney, has said that McGahn will abide by the president’s instructions absent a court reversal.”

-- Republicans are running through a multitude of shifting – and, at times, contradictory – defenses and deflections as they continue to stick together against Trump's impeachment. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “While those attacks — at least 22, according to a Washington Post tally — have done little to undermine the core allegations under investigation in the House, they have been remarkably successful in one respect: keeping congressional Republicans united against impeachment as the GOP casts the probe as partisan.”

-- Democrats on the Intelligence Committee and their attorney spoke the most yesterday. Philip Bump crunched the numbers: “We took C-SPAN’s closed captioning of the hearing and segmented each exchange by who was asking questions and who was responding. In total, [Schiff] spoke for more than half an hour, including lengthy introductory and closing statements. The total time that the witnesses … spent answering Democrats’ queries was about a minute longer than Schiff’s comments and questions. The witnesses spent about 10 more minutes answering Democratic questions than Republican ones, in large part because more Democratic members asked questions.”

-- “Vindman defended himself from claims that Morrison, his boss, had expressed concerns about his judgment, reading from his latest performance evaluation in which another former top NSC official described him as ‘brilliant’ and ‘unflappable,'"" Toluse Olorunnipa reports. ""On Tuesday, Trump also sought to downplay Vindman’s role and influence. ‘I never heard of him. I don’t know any of these people,’ Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. ‘I don’t know Vindman at all. What I do know is that even he said the transcript was correct.’”

-- Vindman’s uniform spoke loud at the hearing. His humanity spoke louder, writes fashion critic Robin Givhan: “When Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman appeared before the [Intelligence Committee], his striking presence in his serviceable eyeglasses and his military uniform exuded authority, ferocity and patriotism. As one of the Democratic committee members noted admiringly, Vindman was wearing a Purple Heart on his uniform. He also had a Combat Infantry Badge pinned on the left side of his chest, indicating he’d been involved in active ground combat. For civilian viewers, it was helpful to understand the meanings of some of the insignia on his jacket. But even without the details, anyone looking at the vast collage of medals spread across his chest could understand the story they told: that Vindman is one of the many dedicated individuals who choose to stand guard so that others might sleep easily.”

-- Vindman's Army uniform became a proxy symbol, either bolstering the claims of Democrats or cited as evidence by Republicans that Vindman is using his service as a shield from criticism. Alex Horton reports: “While active-duty service members routinely wear their full uniforms to testify on Capitol Hill, security experts say the scrutiny of Vindman’s uniform has become another data point in the politicization of the space between civil society and the military. The Army’s bible for appearance standards, AR 670-1, says all personnel ‘will wear an Army uniform when on duty, unless granted an exception by the commander to wear civilian clothes.’ ‘Most reactions to it imply a choice where there is not one. Commentators are projecting their own feelings without understanding military regulations, a pretty frequent occurrence in civil-military relations,’ said Loren DeJonge Schulman, a former Obama defense official who advised national security adviser Susan E. Rice.”

-- There have been six episodes in which top Trump administration and Ukrainian officials discussed a potential quid pro quo, according to congressional testimony, public statements and documents. We’ve gathered the evidence here.

-- Commentary from The Post's opinion page:

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “Dad, my sitting here today, in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,” Vindman said in his opening statement. “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Baltimore’s former mayor Catherine Pugh has been indicted by a federal grand jury on wire fraud and tax evasion over lucrative book deals for her self-published Healthy Holly children’s series. Ann Marimow and Peter Hermann report: “Pugh resigned in May after revelations about the deals she allegedly cut with companies connected to the city and state government, setting off another political crisis and setback for the city. Pugh, 69, was the second Baltimore mayor to leave office in the past decade while facing corruption allegations.

“The indictment accuses her of a years-long scheme dating to 2007. … Federal agents sought financial documents and other information related to almost $800,000 she allegedly was paid for the books, an enormous amount in the world of children’s literature. Pugh is expected to surrender to U.S. Marshals before a court appearance Thursday, prosecutors said. Two former Baltimore employees, Gary Brown Jr, 38, and Roslyn Wedington, 50, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and to filing false tax returns, prosecutors said in a statement.”

-- Uber plans to record audio of customers during rides in the U.S. Faiz Siddiqui scoops: “The new feature, which is first to be piloted in some Latin American cities next month, allows users to opt in to activate an audio recording on any trip or all trips, according to internal communications viewed by The Washington Post and confirmed by Uber. In markets where it’s available, users would likely be given a blanket warning that trips are subject to recording — and that the feature will be active in their market. Riders and drivers will not be able to listen back. ‘When the trip ends, the user will be asked if everything is okay and be able to report a safety incident and submit the audio recording to Uber with a few taps,’ according to an email written by an Uber executive ... ‘The encrypted audio file is sent to Uber’s customer support agents who will use it to better understand an incident and take the appropriate action.’ … The new feature raises privacy concerns over the potential to run afoul of wiretapping and eavesdropping statutes aimed at ensuring people are not recorded without their consent.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- U.S. military aid is helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression, but the drama surrounding the impeachment inquiry is making Kyiv nervous. Sergey Morgunov, Will Englund and Michael Birnbaum report: “Powerful night-vision devices remove the cover of darkness. Counterartillery radar detects and pinpoints the batteries during firing. Surveillance drones, troubled at first by Russian hacking when introduced in 2016, have since proved their worth, Col. Yevhen Bondar said. It all came from the United States, over the course of five years and part of about $4 billion in military and security assistance designed to counter the Moscow-backed separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. … The block on a nearly $400 million aid package, approved by Congress, was lifted Sept. 11, in time to beat the end of the federal fiscal year. For its part, Ukraine is spending nearly 5.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense and security this year, or about $10 billion. The Trump-ordered delay was felt in Ukraine — but not so much in terms of spot shortages of military materiel, because equipment such as this always moves in fits and starts. The real fallout has been one of perception among Ukrainian officials and others — the worry that the White House cannot always be counted on to be in Kyiv’s corner.”

-- But, but, but: $35 million in Pentagon aid still hasn’t reached Ukraine, despite White House assurances, reports the L.A. Times.

-- And Zelensky refused to confirm or deny whether he was prepared to publicly announce an investigation into Burisma after his July 25 call with Trump. CNN posted a video that shows him rolling his eyes when asked on Tuesday, before he brushed off the question. “I think everybody in Ukraine is so tired about Burisma,” he said. “We have our country. We have our independence. We have our problems and questions. That’s it.”

-- Two U.S. service members were killed overnight when their helicopter crashed in Afghanistan while supporting combat operations. Sayed Salahuddin and Susannah George report: “The military said the fatalities brought to 19 the number of U.S. combat deaths in Afghanistan this year, adding that the incident is under investigation. The Taliban said the helicopter was shot down as Afghan and U.S. forces were preparing to launch an attack in the area, according to a statement from Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman. The 19 service members killed so far this year by hostile forces, surpasses the total of 13 who died in 2018.”

-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is searching for a safe exit from his position ahead of a Senate run, three GOP sources tell Time: “Pompeo’s plan had been to remain at the State Department until early spring next year, ... but recent developments, including the House impeachment inquiry, are hurting him politically and straining his relationship with Trump. So Pompeo is rethinking his calendar, say the top Republicans, one who served in the Trump Administration, another who remains in government, and a third who served in several high-ranking posts and is active in GOP politics. The timing of Pompeo’s resignation now will be decided by his ability to navigate the smoothest possible exit from the administration, the three Republicans say.”

-- “Republicans tasked with keeping the party’s Senate majority in the U.S. Senate still see Pompeo as their best option in the open-seat race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts,"" the Kansas City Star reports: ""At a ‘Save the Senate’ event on Nov. 8 at Trump International Hotel in Washington, the National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Kevin McLaughlin told a room full of lawmakers, lobbyists, and GOP donors to call Pompeo and urge him to run ... The gathering took place just weeks after the NRSC, the party’s main campaign arm for Senate races, met with Republican Rep. Roger Marshall, the western Kansas congressman pursuing the seat. Marshall leads all current candidates in fundraising by about $1 million. ‘I think they certainly understand that we’re the frontrunner and I feel like we’re getting a lot of good support from them right now,’ Marshall said Tuesday when asked about the October meeting.”

-- Iran’s security forces may have killed more than 100 protesters as part of a brutal crackdown on demonstrations. Erin Cunningham reports: “The government has acknowledged only five deaths, including four members of the security forces, and has blamed the protests on foreign enemies and saboteurs. If confirmed, the higher death toll would signal a much wider scale of unrest — a crisis taking place under a near-total information blackout. London-based Amnesty said at least 106 demonstrators have been killed in 21 cities since protests began Friday, citing what it said was verified video footage and credible witness testimony. Security forces have used firearms, water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters, according to the report, which also cited the use of live ammunition.”

-- A small group of protesters is still inside Hong Kong's Polytechnic University after a series of mass arrests. Tiffany Liang, Anna Kam, Casey Quackenbush and Gerry Shih report: “Hong Kong’s police force said Tuesday that it had apprehended 1,100 people over the past day alone, as months of violent clashes appeared to reach something of a climax. It said many of the detainees would be charged with rioting and possession of offensive weapons. It was the largest number of arrests and injuries on a single day since the protests began five months ago. … In Hong Kong, concerns rose over the relative handful of protesters who have so far refused to leave the besieged campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, with authorities urging them to come out peacefully but refusing to rule out action to flush them out. ... In Washington, the U.S. Senate, in a unanimous vote, passed legislation Tuesday aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong ... The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act now goes to the House of Representatives, which earlier approved its own version of the measure.""

-- A former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong said he was repeatedly tortured by Chinese secret police over a two-week period over the protests. Simon Denyer, Tiffany Liang and Casey Quanckenbush report: “Simon Cheng, in an account of his treatment published on Facebook, described being handcuffed and shackled, blindfolded and hooded, deprived of sleep, made to sit absolutely still or hung in a uncomfortable spread-eagled position for hours on end, and constantly threatened during incessant interrogations. British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said his government was shocked and appalled by the ‘brutal and disgraceful treatment’ to which Cheng was subjected after being detained during a business trip to Shenzhen in mainland China in August, and said it had summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to protest. But China said its ambassador would never accept Britain’s ‘false allegations.’”

-- Trump’s troop withdrawal from Syria has allowed the Islamic State to gain strength, according to a chilling study by the Pentagon. From Politico: “The withdrawal and incursion allowed ISIS to ‘reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad,’ the quarterly report from the lead inspector general on the U.S. military campaign against ISIS stated. The report cited information from the Defense Intelligence Agency. … ‘In the longer term, ISIS will probably seek to regain control of some Syrian population centers and expand its global footprint, the DIA said,’ the inspector general added.”

-- Some Israelis are celebrating the Trump administration's decision to no longer consider their settlements in the West Bank as illegal under international law. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “At a hastily arranged meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, settler leaders gathered Tuesday at Alon Shvut, a settlement south of Jerusalem, to relish a rare international endorsement of their presence there. ‘I admit I am very moved,’ Netanyahu said at the gathering. He called the Trump administration’s latest policy shift toward Israel ‘an achievement that will stand for generations.’ For many living in Israel’s settlements, the news from Washington was a welcome relief from the drumbeat of condemnation from the international community, including a recent European requirement that products from the settlements carry special labeling. … But observers said their eagerness to do more — add settlements, expand settlements, annex parts of the West Bank — was likely to be met with disappointment, at least in the short term. Like so much else in the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the bombshell announcement was a noisy outburst not likely to make much difference on the contested ground any time soon.”

-- Counterprogramming: On Capitol Hill, a bipartisan mix of officials are showing support for Enes Kanter, the NBA star and Turkish dissident, after Trump welcomed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House last week. Jacob Bogage reports: “Kanter’s jersey from his time with the Oklahoma City Thunder hangs in the office of Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma. He talks about the NBA with Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat known throughout the Senate as a basketball devotee. He has discussed Interpol red notices with Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and joked about Boston sports fans with Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.). Then last week, Kanter, a center for the Boston Celtics, stood shoulder to shoulder with Wyden and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in the Capitol as they introduced human rights legislation aimed at Turkey. ... Kanter has used that attention and the spotlight of his NBA career to crusade for a more democratic Turkey, befriending and recruiting to the cause American lawmakers from each city he has played in during his nine-year NBA career. Few other prominent Turks have taken a stand against Erdogan in Washington.”

-- Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his challenger, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, had their first debate last night ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “The debate on ITV showcased a dozen ordinary voters allowed to ask their questions. ... Johnson promised he had a Brexit deal ready to pop into the oven, heat and serve. Corbyn said it was ‘nonsense’ to say Johnson could complete Brexit by January. He said a trade deal with the European Union would take seven years to negotiate. … Johnson said he would get Brexit done — and challenged Corbyn again on his position on Britain’s leaving the European Union. Corbyn said he would quickly negotiate a new, softer Brexit deal with the E.U. and then take it to the public in a second referendum. … Corbyn is trailing overall in a sample of recent opinion surveys and, given that he did not break through during the debate, will hope to generate more excitement Thursday with the launch of his party’s election manifesto.”

-- Years after freezing new projects, China is back to building coal power plants. Gerry Shih reports: “In the past two years, China has expanded its coal fleet by 43 gigawatts — roughly the entire coal-fired capacity of Germany, according to Global Energy Monitor, a group that tracks construction in the Chinese power industry using public announcements and satellite images. Excluding China, global coal power capacity would otherwise be dropping as countries in Europe and elsewhere decommission old facilities and switch to other energy sources, the group said in a report released Wednesday.""

-- Venice’s plan to protect itself from flooding became a disaster in itself. Chico Harlan and Stefano Pitrelli report: “It is among the most ambitious works of civil engineering in modern Italian history, an underwater fortress of steel designed to rise from the depths during high tides to protect the lagoon city of Venice. But decades after being conceived, the project remains incomplete and unusable, little more than a refuge for the clams and barnacles that have made the machinery their home. Venice, meantime, remains vulnerable, as demonstrated by the tides that inundated the city last week, flooding piazzas, churches and hotels, depositing layers of salt that eat away marble. The city’s 6 billion euro flood barrier has been under construction since 2003 and was originally supposed to take eight years. Now, the best guess is that it will be ready by 2021 or 2022. Some experts say that, given the pace of sea-level rise, it may be obsolete just decades after it starts operating. Others wonder, given its sorry history, whether the system will ever be ready. Parts of the underwater project are already corroding.”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, days after being pardoned for war crimes by Trump, has been ordered to appear before Navy leaders today, where he is expected to be notified that he'll be ousted from the Navy SEALs. From the Times: “Navy officials had planned to begin the process of taking away Chief Gallagher’s Trident pin, the symbol of his membership in the SEALs, earlier this month. But as he waited outside his commander’s office, Navy leaders sought clearance from the White House that never came, and no action was taken. Admiral [Collin] Green now has the authorization he needs from the Navy to act against Chief Gallagher, and the formal letter notifying the chief of the action has been drafted by the admiral … The Navy also plans to take the Tridents of three SEAL officers who oversaw Chief Gallagher — Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil — and their letters have been drafted as well … Removing a Trident does not entail a reduction in rank, but it effectively ends a SEAL’s career. … The move sets up a potential confrontation between Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly championed Chief Gallagher, and Admiral Green, who has said he intends to overhaul discipline and ethics in the SEAL teams and sees Chief Gallagher’s behavior as an obstacle.”

-- White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham is facing backlash after she claimed without evidence that aides to former president Barack Obama left behind disparaging messages on the day Trump was inaugurated. Toluse Olorunnipa and Josh Dawsey report: “Grisham said that White House aides left ‘Obama books' throughout the White House and taped a big ‘You will fail’ sign on the door of the press office before Trump aides moved in — claims that sparked a chorus of condemnation from former Obama administration officials. Grisham then modified her assertions later in the day, changing key parts of her story and saying she viewed the alleged conduct as little more than a harmless prank. … Grisham did not provide evidence to back up her allegations. No other administration official has made any similar allegations publicly in the 34 months since Trump entered the White House. Five former senior administration officials present on Day One in 2017 said they do not remember witnessing or hearing of any notes like the ones that Grisham described. ‘Not in my office,’ said one of the former officials.”

-- The American Medical Association called for an immediate ban on all electronic cigarettes and vaping devices. From the AP: “The AMA cited a surge in underage teen use of e-cigarettes, which typically heat a solution that contains nicotine. ‘It’s simple, we must keep nicotine products out of the hands of young people,’ Dr. Patrice Harris, AMA’s president, said in a statement. The doctors’ group said a separate health issue also prompted its action — the recent U.S. outbreak of lung illnesses linked to vaping. Most of those sickened said they vaped THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana, not nicotine. Officials believe a thickening agent used in black market THC vaping products may be a culprit.”

-- Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump's commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the administration, explained what he thinks the Trump administration should do on vaping: “E-cigs aren’t safe, but when used properly they are not nearly has harmful as lighting tobacco on fire and smoking it. Yet providing adult smokers with a safer alternative to cigarettes cannot come at the expense of addicting a generation of young people to nicotine with these same products. New data from the Food and Drug Administration shows almost a third of teens now vape. And according to a study published in February in the Journal of the American Medical Association, young people who start out using nicotine through e-cigs are more likely to become long-term smokers. The solution is to get e-cigs out of the hands of kids but preserve the devices’ potential to help adult smokers fully quit cigarettes.""

-- The House passed a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown on Friday, setting up a December showdown over Trump’s border wall that could fall in the midst of impeachment votes. Erica Werner reports: “The legislation, which passed 231 to 192, extends government funding through Dec. 20. It must pass the Senate and be signed by Trump before midnight Thursday. If not, government funding would expire, causing many agencies to begin to shutter operations and furlough staff. The Senate is expected to act on the legislation ahead of the deadline. A senior administration official said Tuesday that Trump is expected to sign the bill. …

""Ahead of the vote, lawmakers of both parties bemoaned their failure to agree on the 12 annual spending bills for 2020, and the resulting need to enact short-term measures once again. … And in an ominous sign of increased partisanship around the spending process, only 12 House Republicans voted in favor of the short-term spending bill Tuesday -- many fewer than the 76 Republicans who supported the last stop-gap bill.""

-- Former House speaker John Boehner returned to a Capitol transformed from heated partisanship into a cauldron of constitutional standoff. Paul Kane reports: “Officially there to unveil a portrait that will hang in a venerated room just off the House floor, Boehner brought with him one last bid to get his former colleagues to embrace a style that charmed friends and enemies alike. He remains an eternal optimist who views the world as a ‘glass half full’ — usually with red wine in one hand, a Camel cigarette in the other, handkerchief stuffed into his coat pocket to wipe away his ever-flowing tears. ‘It doesn’t cost anything to be nice. I’d like to think we were able to disagree without being disagreeable,’ Boehner told several hundred well-wishers inside Statuary Hall. ‘And I’d like to think that we tried to do the right things for the right reasons.’ Boehner rejected the chance to weigh in on impeachment, as he did again Tuesday in an interview with Fox Business Network, where he and one of his lobbying partners, Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), the former member of House Democratic leadership, touted a pension plan supported by their firm. ‘I’ll just observe,’ Boehner said of Trump.”

-- Customs and Border Protection issued a new edict regarding which U.S. officials are worthy of a framed portrait on the agency’s walls: Just the president. Maria Sacchetti reports: “The shrinking photo gallery is the result of an agency mandate to feature only Senate-confirmed leaders and elected officials on its walls. Because Trump has said he prefers to keep many top officials in ‘acting’ positions to make it easier to fire them, and because the president has repeatedly refused to nominate the agency’s leaders for confirmation, Trump’s photo will stand alone. … CBP issued the edict because Trump last week replaced acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan with acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf. Because McAleenan was CBP’s most recently confirmed commissioner, he appeared on the agency’s walls in that capacity, agency spokeswoman Stephanie Malin said. The agency displays only portraits of officials in ‘confirmed leadership positions.’”

-- Two jail workers were charged with falsifying records of checks on Jeffrey Epstein the night he died. Devlin Barrett reports: “A grand jury charged Tova Noel and Michael Thomas with conspiring to defraud the United States and making false records while working at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. They are accused of repeatedly signing false paperwork that they conducted regular checks Aug. 10 on Epstein and other inmates. Epstein was found hanging in his cell early that morning, and the city’s medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. For ‘substantial portions of their shifts, Noel and Thomas sat at their desk, browsed the Internet, and moved around the common area’ of the section of the jail where Epstein was held, known as the Special Housing Unit, or SHU, the grand jury charged. The indictment charges that Noel and Thomas repeatedly signed false ‘count slips’ even though they failed to conduct the required counts at midnight, 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. They also failed to check more frequently on Epstein, as had been ordered by higher-ups at the jail, according to the indictment. The document repeatedly notes that its charges are based on ‘video from the MCC’s internal video surveillance system.’”

-- The Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman who carried out the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas pleaded guilty. From NBC News: “Douglas Haig, 57, of Mesa, Arizona, admitted he made ammunition without a license. Haig came under investigation when armor-piercing bullets found inside Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them. Haig has admitted selling 720 rounds of tracer ammunition to the shooter in the weeks before the massacre that killed 58 people. Haig's guilty plea involves the illegal manufacture of armor-piercing rounds.”

-- Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) wants compassion for the Trump supporter convicted of making death threats against her. Lateshia Beachum reports: “Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., 55, of Addison, N.Y., entered the guilty plea before Chief U.S. District Judge Frank P. Geraci for threatening to assault and murder the freshman congresswoman and for being a felon in possession of firearms ... The plea stems from a March call that Carlineo made to Omar’s Washington, D.C., office. … Although he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, Omar wrote an open letter to Geraci requesting that he refrain from sentencing Carlineo to a long prison term and a large fine. Carlineo needs compassion and restorative justice that will allow him to understand the consequences of his actions and to make amends, she wrote. ... Carlineo told an FBI special agent that ‘if our forefathers were still alive, they’d put a bullet in her head' ... He told investigators that he was a President Trump-loving patriot who ‘hates radical Muslims’ in the government ... Carlineo told FBI agents that he had a shotgun and a .22 caliber firearm at his home that he claimed belonged to his girlfriend but later admitted to belonged to him...""

-- A white teen girl with a detailed plan for a racist attack on black churchgoers in her notebook was arrested in Georgia, police said. Derek Hawkins reports: “The 16-year-old girl was charged with attempt to commit murder after students at her high school told administrators she had a notebook filled with ‘detailed plans’ to kill members of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Gainesville, Ga., according to police. The alleged plot was ‘definitely racially motivated,’ said Sgt. Kevin Holbrook of the Gainesville Police Department. The notebook, he said, contained ‘manifesto-type’ language that discussed how she wanted to assault black parishioners with butcher knives and other sharp-edged weapons.""

-- An Air Force master sergeant, Cory Reeves, was demoted after being accused of spreading white nationalist propaganda, but he is allowed to continue serving. Katie Shepherd reports: “The episode highlights a growing concern about active-duty military and veterans joining the ranks of white supremacist organizations. The leaked Discord chat logs, published by the nonprofit media collective Unicorn Riot in March, led journalists and activists to expose members of the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps as members of Identity Evropa, which has been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.""

-- A white supremacist manifesto received by Syracuse University students prompted a fresh wave of concern on the campus where nearly a dozen racist incidents in the past two weeks have sparked calls for outside investigations. Kim Bellware reports: “Since Nov. 7, when racist scrawls were discovered in dormitory bathrooms and hallways, the campus of nearly 23,000 students has been shaken by at least 10 more hate-fueled episodes ... The incidents have drawn national attention and spurred sit-ins, protests and intervention from the state’s top elected officials. Freshman Dumebi Ebemor said Tuesday that university officials had not canceled classes after the distribution of the manifesto, which Syracuse police later said appears to be identical to the white supremacist manifesto shared by the gunman in the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. The racist screed was sent to students in the university’s Bird Library via the Apple file-sharing feature AirDrop.""

It’s being held in Atlanta at the Tyler Perry Studios, and you can watch online on washingtonpost.com or on our apps, as well as on MSNBC.

Ten candidates qualified to be onstage, meaning this debate has two fewer candidates than last month.

-- Dave Weigel sketches out what he's watching for tonight:

What does Pete Buttigieg do under pressure? “Every other campaign has some level of contempt for the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Some have expressed it subtly, like [Elizabeth] Warren decrying ‘consultant-driven’ campaigns; some have been more direct, like former HUD secretary Julián Castro warning that Buttigieg can't excite nonwhite voters. … In the past, Buttigieg has gotten around tough questions with the help of rival candidates who didn't want to attack him.”

“The Massachusetts senator's slip in the polls could benefit her in one small way: It's put more pressure on Buttigieg. … Warren's campaign has readied itself for attacks on her past and has been occasionally surprised when they haven't come.” Does Bernie Sanders still treat Warren like a partner? “For the first time, Sanders and Warren do have slightly different plans: Warren would use her first budget to begin enrolling people in an expanded version of Medicare but not end duplicative private insurance until three years later. The question is whether Sanders, who is generally viewed by voters as more trustworthy than Warren, explores that question or defends the overall goal of his legislation, shared by Warren, against all comers.”

-- Biden is planning a major Iowa push after tonight's debate as concerns grow about his weaknesses in the first voting state. Matt Viser and Holly Bailey report: “Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”

-- Biden has durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class workers who see him as one of their own. From the Times: “In dozens of interviews, from parades and union rallies to black churches and political picnics, working-class Democrats who support Mr. Biden explained their views in practical terms: they know and trust the Scranton native from his long tenure as a Delaware senator and as Barack Obama’s vice president, they find his incremental policy proposals realistic and they think he can win. … Surveys in this race indicate a return to the longstanding tradition in Democratic primaries of voters splitting along class lines, and illuminate a key slice of Mr. Biden’s base. … For some voters, Mr. Biden appeals because there are strategic assumptions at work: many black working-class Democrats believe that white America will only support a well-known white male, such as Mr. Biden, while a number of working-class white Democrats also believe he is the most acceptable nominee. Some voters cited the misogyny and racism that female candidates and candidates of color have experienced in previous races.”

-- There are two Rhodes Scholars running for president, but Buttigieg gets way more credit for this than Cory Booker. From HuffPost: “HuffPost searched mentions in U.S. publications for 2019, finding that news outlets cited Buttigieg’s Rhodes scholarship 596 times. Booker had just 79 mentions.” Booker also attended Stanford and Yale Law.

-- Documents reveal that a massive “dark-money” group pumped $140 million into Democratic and left-leaning causes in 2018. From Politico: “The Sixteen Thirty Fund, a little-known nonprofit headquartered in Washington, spent $141 million on more than 100 left-leaning causes during the midterm election year, according to a new tax filing from the group. The money contributed to efforts ranging from fighting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and other Trump judicial nominees to boosting ballot measures raising the minimum wage and changing laws on voting and redistricting in numerous states. The spending was fueled by massive anonymous donations, including one gift totaling $51.7 million. That single donation was more than the group had ever raised before in an entire year before [Trump] was elected.”

-- Liberal groups, anxious over Trump’s growing lead in the money race, are committing to spend in general-election swing states during the primaries. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout. ‘We can’t wait until we have a candidate to do this work,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive of Acronym, a politically active nonprofit supporting Democrats.""

SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:

Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party on July 4 to become an independent after concluding that Trump committed impeachable offenses, said Volker and Morrison didn't help the GOP's case:

Today was really bad for Pres. Trump, especially the afternoon testimonies of Volker and Morrison—probably the worst yet for the president. Republicans keep pressing witnesses on their legal understandings, but they are there as fact witnesses, and the facts are consistently bad. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) November 20, 2019

Another former GOP congressman, who represented Florida and has emerged as a Trump critic, mocked an ex-colleague:

The official White House Twitter account attacked a current White House official in the middle of that official's testimony before Congress:

Tim Morrison, Alexander Vindman's former boss, testified in his deposition that he had concerns about Vindman's judgment. pic.twitter.com/xwHOt4bsHS — The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 19, 2019

The White House's director of social media also attacked Vindman from his government account, prompting this observation from a Post colleague:

This is the equivalent of the executive editor of The Washington Post tweeting that one of his reporters can't be trusted. I can't imagine a more toxic work environment. https://t.co/ka35qAd3vS — Greg Jaffe (@GregJaffe) November 19, 2019

The president's son also attacked the Army officer:

What a joke... Can anyone watch this and believe that Vindman has any credibility?

A Politico reporter compared Volker's private deposition with his public testimony:

Big change from Volker's first testimony to his opening statement today.

One of our national security correspondents explained how Volker's story still doesn't really add up:

Volker assertion that he saw ""sharp distinction"" between Burisma and Biden is an assertion of fairly astonishing ignorance -- he never googled Burisma? Never wondered why it Trump/Giuliani so interested in one company? Missed Giuliani public statements? & on & on — Greg Miller (@gregpmiller) November 19, 2019

And a CNN correspondent observed another damning fact pattern that's now taken as a given:

still striking that while there is debate over explicit linkage of security assistance to statement of investigations into political rival, there is zero debate that same statement - targeting political rival & 2016 - was openly discussed in exchange for a White House meeting — Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) November 19, 2019

The two witnesses in the morning went back to work at the White House after their testimony:

The Investigations

'THE GORDON PROBLEM': Loose cannon, wild card, unpredictable, cliffhanger.

Those were some of the words used by Republicans and Democrats to describe the key witness in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump: Gordon Sondland, who will testify on Capitol Hill this morning.

The Oregon hotelier whose political contributions led him to become Trump's ambassador to the European Union faces a big choice: whether to deny further direct contacts with Trump or to confirm details of a now infamous phone call overheard at a Kyiv restaurant directly tying the president to the effort to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into his political opponents.

The stakes are high, and higher still than other past star witnesses in high-profile congressional probes: John Dean had a plea agreement when he testified against Richard Nixon; and Oliver North and Richard Poindexter had immunity when talking about the Iran-Contra affair, report my colleagues Aaron C. Davis and Rachael Bade.

Sondland has no such agreement and what he will say this morning is anyone's guess.

“We aren't sure what his posture will be,” a Democratic lawmaker told Power Up.

“There is going to be enormous pressure on Sondland to minimize the president’s role — even as we have people under oath saying Sondland has already misrepresented his position and the extent of the contacts he had with the president,” Timothy Naftali, a history professor at New York University and co-author of the book “Impeachment,” per Aaron and Rachael.

Second chance?: Lawmakers had not-so-subtle messages for Sondland, who has already provided seven hours of closed- door testimony in which he downplayed his relationship with Trump and omitted key details other witnesses have provided.

From Democrats: “If I was Ambassador Sondland, I would take a deep breath and start over,” Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) told Aaron and Rachael. “Take into consideration everything we have learned from other witnesses. Tell us exactly what took place and his interactions with the president … It’s never too late to do the right thing.”

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) encouraged Sondland to “be truthful” in an interview with Aaron and Rachael: “It would be liberating for you to just be truthful. It’s amazing how many people rise to the occasion to do that. The fact that [Sondland] amended his testimony should be encouraging.”

From Republicans: “I expect Ambassador Sondland to tell us the same thing he said in his deposition,” House Intelligence Committee member K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.) told Aaron and Rachael. “Asked what would happen if he does not, he said: 'Well, there are legal ramifications for that, for changing your [testimony]. He’s got to have good reasons.'”

“The impeachment effort comes down to one guy, Ambassador Sondland,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who like many Republicans has argued that only a first-person account of Trump leveraging U.S. power for personal gain could give Democrats grounds to impeach. “All the other testimony has a Sondland core to it and a Sondland connection.”

said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who like many Republicans has argued that only a first-person account of Trump leveraging U.S. power for personal gain could give Democrats grounds to impeach. “All the other testimony has a Sondland core to it and a Sondland connection.” “At this particular point, we have no reason to believe that he’s going to go back against a deposition that he gave and then revised,” Meadows told reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday, per Roll Call's Lindsey McPherson. “They have to either get him to turn on the president or attack his credibility.""

And Trump allies sought to downplay Sonland's connection to the president. Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign official who now hosts a podcast with Steve Bannon, trashed the ambassador.

“Amb. Sondland is a dilettante trying to seem more important to the president than he is, be a big shot,"" Miller said on the podcast.

The facts: Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide, corroborated that Sondland and Trump were in close contact in yesterday's testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

“Among the discussions I had with Dr. [Fiona] Hill about Ambassador Sondland — I think she might have coined it the ‘Gordon problem’ — and I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing. I didn't necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested that he believed was important,” Morrison told lawmakers. “He wanted to get a meeting -- I understood that the president wanted to do and had agreed to a meeting so I was tracking that we need to schedule a meeting.”

I didn't necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested that he believed was important,” Morrison told lawmakers. “He wanted to get a meeting -- I understood that the president wanted to do and had agreed to a meeting so I was tracking that we need to schedule a meeting.” Kurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, amended his deposition to say that an investigation into Burisma was actually discussed during a July 10 meeeting at the White House with Sondland and Ukrainian officials.

Sondland did make “a generic comment about investigations,” which “all of us thought was inappropriate,” Volker told lawmakers.

The discrepancies in Sondland's closed door deposition certainly present some credibility issues — he already made a significant revision to his testimony earlier this month:

After initially testifying he had no recollection of any quid pro quo, Sondland amended his testimony to say he did actually recall telling a Ukrainian official that security assistance and an Oval Office meeting were conditioned on the investigations.

Another discrepancy: ""Witnesses have said Sondland pressured Ukrainian officials over the investigations, including at a White House meeting July 10. Sondland last month said he recalled no such exchange,"" per Rachael and Aaron.

Sondland's biggest decision will be to decide whether to confirm the account of a problematic phone call with the president that he failed to mention in previous testimony. David Holmes, a counselor in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine who will testify publicly tomorrow after giving a private account to lawmakers, overheard a July 26 phone call between Sondland and Trump at a restaurant in Kyiv.

“I then heard President Trump ask, ‘So, he’s gonna do the investigation?’ ” Holmes testified, per the transcript. “Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘he’s gonna do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will do ‘anything you ask him to.’ ”

On The Hill

Some other highlights from yesterday: Trump’s July 25 call was not so perfect, according to yesterday's witnesses.

“Three current and former Trump administration officials described Tuesday how they harbored a variety of concerns surrounding a July phone call in which President Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — boosting Democrats’ inquiry into whether Trump should be impeached and substantially undercutting the president’s assertion that the conversation was ‘perfect,’” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Mike DeBonis and Matt Zapotosky.

There was one official who did not view the call as problematic, though: Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Vice President Pence’s national security adviser, said in a rare public statement released Tuesday he had been on the call and heard “nothing wrong or improper.”

Volker defends Biden: While Volker claimed that he was not aware of a quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukrainians, he did offer an impassioned defense of Joe Biden and called the anti-Biden campaign inappropriate:

“I have known Vice President Biden for 24 years. He is an honorable man and I hold him in the highest regard,” Volker told lawmakers.

About the “conspiracy theory” peddled by Rudy Giuliani that the former veep was compromised in his duties because of his son’s involvement in Burisma: “The accusation that Vice President Biden was acting inappropriately didn’t seem at all credible to me...The allegations against Biden are self-serving and not credible.”

A tense exchange: Lt. Col Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an NSC expert on Ukrainel, spoke with a contact in the intelligence community about Trump’s July 25 phone call but refused to disclose the name of the official, per the advice of his attorney:

“When Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, began asking for more details about the person, Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) interjected and warned about any attempts to out the anonymous whistleblower who first filed a complaint related to the call,” per our colleague Aaron Blake.

What corruption?: Trump didn’t raise the issue of Ukrainian corruption on his April call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite being provided talking points on the issue for the call from the NSC staff, Vindman testified.

“Those were the recommended talking points that were cleared through the NSC staff for the president,” Vindman said.

How Vindman concluded his tear-jerker of an opening statement:

“Dad, my sitting here today, in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,” he said. “Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth.”

From the Courts

THREE COURT CASES YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING:

Trump could be deposed in Summer Zervos case: “Trump lost his latest bid Monday to delay a former 'Apprentice' contestant’s defamation suit as he faces a Jan. 31 deadline to undergo pretrial questioning in the case, which involves claims of unwanted kissing and groping,” the Associated Press's Jennifer Peltz reports.

More details: “A New York appellate judge rejected Trump’s request, meaning that [Zervos’s] case can continue, at least for now,” the AP reports. “Trump’s lawyers signaled they intend to pursue more legal avenues to try to hold off [Zervos’s] case … Zervos, a California restaurateur, appeared on 'The Apprentice' when Trump hosted the show in 2006. She alleges the then-businessman subjected her to unwelcome advances when she sought career advice in 2007.”

McGahn subpoena case will be ruled on by Monday: “The House Judiciary Committee is planning to hold hearings on impeaching [Trump] that expand past the Ukraine investigation and wants former White House counsel Don McGahn to be forced to testify, according to a new court filing,” CNN's Katelyn Polantz reports.

On the quick timeline: The Judiciary panel “asked a federal judge to make a ruling quickly on whether McGahn must testify in the House impeachment inquiry, citing a 'finite window of time' when he's needed,” CNN reports. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, an Obama appointee, said she will issue a ruling by Monday.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, an Obama appointee, said she will issue a ruling by Monday. Remember: House Democrats have viewed the McGahn suit as the best avenue to resolve the questions over whether congressional subpoenas carry more weight than the White House refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. A favorable ruling could convince Charles Kupperman, a former top national security aide, and possibly former national security adviser John Bolton to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry.

ICYMI: The Supreme Court delays fight over Trump's taxes: “The Supreme Court on Monday gave itself a little more time to decide whether a House committee gets to see [Trump’s] financial records,” our colleague Bob Barnes reports.

The House itself had OKed holding off on obtaining the returns: “Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. put on hold 'until further order' a lower court’s ruling that said the accounting firm Mazars USA must turn over eight years of personal and business financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee,” our colleague writes. “The House itself had acquiesced to such a move earlier … Without the court’s intervention, the firm would have been required to turn over the records Wednesday.”

The Washington Post and MSNBC to host special debate coverage live from Atlanta.

The Campaign

IT'S DEBATE NIGHT: The fifth Democratic presidential debate is tonight and will be co-hosted by MSNBC and The Post.

How to watch: Coverage starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and the debate will run from 9 to 11 p.m. The Demoratic face-off will air on MSNBC and will be streamed on msnbc.com and The Post’s digital platforms, including washingtonpost.com.

The state of the race: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at [tonight's] debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. And that makes the debate a serious threat for him,” Politico's Elena Schneider reports.

Who are Buttigieg's rivals?: "" … It's hard to define who those rivals are,” our colleague Dave Weigel wrote in The Trailer last night. “Every other campaign has some level of contempt for the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Some have expressed it subtly, like Warren decrying 'consultant-driven' campaigns; some have been more direct, like former HUD secretary Julián Castro warning that Buttigieg can't excite nonwhite voters.”

Georgia on their minds: "" … While Democrats see themselves as poised to take over the state, they are a long way from building the kind of coordinated effort that Georgia Republicans — and Democrats in places like Virginia and elsewhere — have long enjoyed. Turning the historically red state blue, it turns out, is harder to pull off than to predict,” our colleague Jenna Johnson writes of efforts to make the Peach State competitive in 2020.

Stacey Abrams weighs in: “Any clear-eyed review of the numbers makes clear that Georgia is on the precipice of political change. Where Virginia sat a few cycles ago, Georgia sits today,” Abrams writes in an op-ed for The Post. 'Why is that? Here in Georgia, our rapidly diversifying population includes the youngest and most heavily African American population of any battleground state. Political participation among voters is increasing here. Among newcomers to the state, who are many, Democrats outperform Republicans by a 30-point margin. Multiple state polls have shown [Trump’s] approval underwater in Georgia.”

Biden facing troubles in Iowa: As Dave writes, the former vice president needs a solid debate performance. But he also has some serious ground to make up in the home stretch to the first-in-the-nation caucuses, a state that has doomed him before, our colleagues Matt Viser and Holly Bailey report.

Key stats: Biden promised to visit all of Iowa's 99 counties, a commitment known as the “full Grassley,"" named after the state's senior senator. “Nearly seven months later, he has visited only about a quarter of those counties,” our colleagues write. “He has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals.”

President Grover Cleveland during his first term in 1888. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1893, shortly after his second inaugural.

In the Media

WAYBACK WEDNESDAY: ""This was the plan: The president would take a friend’s yacht from New York to his summer home in Cape Cod. While at sea, a team of doctors would perform a major surgery through the roof of the president’s mouth. And there was an important directive: No matter what, the doctors could not touch the president’s trademark mustache,"" our colleague Gillian Brockell reports.

Trump's previously unscheduled trip to Walter Reed raised eyebrows: But the fears the president had some sort of procedure or operation aren't as far-fetched as you might think. White Houses have previously obscured and in some cases outright lied about a commander-in-chief's health and the story of President Grover Cleveland's secret 1893 operation to remove a cancerous growth in his mouth might be the biggest cover-up of them all.

The details: ""At the time, the U.S. economy was declining and heading toward a depression. Cleveland feared — quite rightly, Algeo wrote — that if news of his diagnosis became public, the economic situation would get even worse,"" our colleague quotes of Matthew Alego's book on the entire episode.

A different kind of yacht club: ""The surgery was performed aboard the yacht Oneida on July 1, 1893. A team of six surgeons took only 90 minutes to extract the tumor, five teeth and large section of Cleveland’s left jawbone — all through the roof of his mouth,"" our colleague writes.

An undated photo of the yacht Oneida, which later became the USS Adelante, taken some time before World War I.

A gigantic scoop changed everything: “Then, on Aug. 29, the Philadelphia Press published what Algeo calls 'one of the greatest scoops in the history of American journalism.' The president, the newspaper reported, had had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor aboard his friend’s yacht. The reporter, E.J. Edwards, knew everything, right down to the names of each doctor on board,"" our colleague writes.

The response? Lie.: The initial reporting spread the same panic the White House wanted to prevent. So, “Cleveland’s associates kicked into high gear,"" our colleague write. “The lead doctor, Cabinet officials and a presidential aide all released statements saying the story was untrue. A newspaper editor who was close friends with Cleveland said the problem had been nothing more than a toothache.""

After he emerged unscathed from a presidential candidates’ debate in Atlanta, where many expected him to become a piñata, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg is heading toward the holidays in an enviable position in Iowa and New Hampshire polls. He appears to have plenty of money, a solid organization, and a degree of popularity that is likely to improve as he becomes better known (according to Morning Consult, 39 percent of Democratic primary voters don’t know enough about him to form an opinion). And it’s entirely possible that six of his rivals will be spending crucial days leading up to the early-state contests stuck in Washington in an impeachment trial with constraints on their ability to speak freely.

It is probably time, then, to think seriously about this unlikely candidate as a potential challenger to Donald Trump. To ask the slippery but inevitable question that anxious Democratic voters appear to keep in the back (if not the front) of their minds, is Mayor Pete electable?

For those who place faith in early head-to-head polls (which have a shaky reputation for reliability), there’s limited relevant data, since Buttigieg wasn’t often tested against Trump until recently. He has a 2.8 percent advantage over the president in the RealClearPolitics polling averages (not that impressive compared to Biden’s 9.6 percent edge, or Sanders’s 7.9 percent, or Warren’s 6.8 percent). But his relatively low name ID may artificially depress his numbers. Political scientist Robert Griffin estimates that Buttigieg’s six-point matchup advantage over Trump in one poll would jump to ten percent if he became as well-known as the Big Three.

Concerns about the mayor’s electability, though, are less about numbers than about questions concerning the coalition of voters he might or might not put together. Ironically, the candidate whose rhetoric and ideology are strikingly reminiscent of the 44th president’s has generated more skepticism than any of his rivals in terms of reviving the Obama coalition that once seemed to promise Democrats perpetual victory.

Despite his youth — which he emphasizes regularly on the campaign trail — Buttigieg isn’t notably lighting up young people. A new Civiqs poll of Iowa that shows him with a solid overall lead also shows him trailing septuagenarians Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren among under-35 voters, while he leads the field among seniors.

Buttigieg’s overwhelmingly white base of support has gotten a lot of attention. In a recent Latino Decisions poll of California Latinos, he came in at one percent, a point behind Andrew Yang. And his inability to attract African-American support is becoming even more conspicuous as his strength in mostly white places like Iowa and New Hampshire grows. Whether you think his problem in this demographic stems from the problems he’s had in South Bend with police-minority relations, or from his sexual orientation, or from his general “wine track” political style, it’s real, and it presents a real obstacle in his path to the nomination — particularly when the majority-black electorate in South Carolina weighs in on February 29. A new Quinnipiac poll of the Palmetto State released earlier this week gives Buttigieg a flat zero percent among black voters. And here’s how Reid Epstein summarizes the mayor’s visible black supporters:

Mr. Buttigieg has so few black elected officials and former elected officials backing him that they could all fit into a single S.U.V. The issue emerged during a meeting he held this summer with Congressional Black Caucus members who pressed him about why he did not have black officials from South Bend vouching for him on the campaign trail.

Of the black elected officials and former elected officials who have endorsed him, only Sean Shaw, a former one-term Florida state representative who lost his statewide race last year, has been to South Carolina on his behalf.

The vibe could soon get worse:

Our Revolution, a political organization backing Mr. Sanders, is planning a Dec. 7 rally in South Bend that will highlight Mr. Buttigieg’s handling of the June police shooting and feature a black South Bend Common Council member aggrieved that two of her properties were razed by Mr. Buttigieg’s municipal government.

Putting aside the impact of Buttigieg’s narrow band of support on what you might call his “nominatability,” though, does it mean he would lose a general election to the likes of Donald Trump? That’s hard to say.

Without question, Democrats are counting on minority-voter enthusiasm in 2020, and having a nominee who leaves black and brown voters cold could be a serious problem, particularly in the Rust Belt states where mediocre black-voter turnout was a factor in Hillary Clinton’s shocking 2016 loss. But then again, after three years of the racist stylings of the president, African-Americans may not need much motivation to turn out to smite him next year. As Frank Newport of Gallup noted this week, Trump’s job approval rating among black voters has been stuck at 10 to 11 percent since his inauguration, a number likely to produce a general-election showing in the single digits. If Trump decides, as is likely, to rev up his base with some unusually crude appeals to white identity politics, Buttigieg’s black enthusiasm problem could vanish. It’s also likely that Mayor Pete’s ambitious “Douglass Plan” for black empowerment, which has so far failed to move primary voters in his direction, would look much better to African-American voters in the context of a general-election contest with Trump.

It’s even more likely that the progressive activists who are currently expressing hostility to Buttigieg would come around. Much as they dislike Medicare for All Who Want It, it’s infinitely preferable to such Republican policy wish-list items as privatizing Medicare, repealing Obamacare, and radically cutting Medicaid.

In the end, though, a vote’s a vote, and the real question is whether Buttigieg could reach enough voters other potential nominees would miss to offset some turnout gaps. In that vein, his regional appeal is certainly germane to his competitiveness in those same Rust Belt states that Clinton lost. And the very wine-track style that creates problems with some voters may attract others — particularly those Republican-leaning suburbanites who helped Democrats retake the House last year.

One unavoidable question about Buttigieg is whether being the first openly gay major-party presidential nominee would be a net positive or negative. It’s almost impossible to calculate. The percentage of Americans saying they would be fine with a gay president is steadily rising, but a recent Morning Consult survey showed 37 percent weren’t ready for it. Recognizing that a solid majority of such voters probably wouldn’t vote for any liberal, it’s simply not clear whether the “backlash” to Buttigieg’s sexual orientation would exceed the “frontlash” from voters, including LGBTQ voters, pleased to break this particular barrier. And regardless of objective reality, yet another “nominatability” problem for Mayor Pete is that risk-averse Democrats might not want to test the proposition in this particular cycle, when a second Trump term is the punishment for guessing wrong.

If Buttigieg does, against the odds, become the Democratic presidential nominee in Milwaukee next July, he would be in a position to campaign as the ultimate un-Trump: progressive where Trump is reactionary; multilingual where Trump is barely literate in English; a meritocrat running against a great symbol of inherited privilege; a vet opposing a draft dodger; an observant Christian exposing the shallow belief system of a philistine and heathen. And in fact, that’s a context in which Buttigieg’s Obama-style rhetoric of unity and uplift might strike some sparks, instead of just reminding those who affectionately harken back to Trump’s predecessor of what the country has lost."

For days leading up to Wednesday’s Democratic debate, Pete Buttigieg and his team tried to figure out what was about to hit them. With the mayor on the rise in early state polling, it was time for him to be treated like a front-runner onstage, they figured, and that probably meant he’d face real heat from his opponents for the first time this campaign. Prepping in Las Vegas and then Atlanta, they thought the inevitable criticisms would focus on three potentially vulnerable areas for him: his lack of support with black voters (which he’s been struggling to answer for), his lack of experience (“The guy was born, in political terms, six months ago,” one prominent Buttigieg supporter told me before the debate), and the mysterious nature of his postcollege corporate work for McKinsey (he released two years’ worth of tax records hours before the debate to try to preempt some of the questions).

But then, for two hours on Wednesday night, the field held off.

Kamala Harris looked like she was previewing a swipe at Buttigieg when she dismissively repurposed Buttigieg’s assertion that Trump’s eventual departure from the White House would be “a tender moment in the life of this country.” (Harris said, “There is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice on the ballot.”) But she then passed on an easy chance to criticize his African-American outreach stumbles, noting that he’d apologized for an embarrassing mistake involving a stock photo from Kenya. Soon after it looked like Cory Booker’s turn, but he also let Buttigieg mostly off the hook by leaving his name out of an indirect jab: “I have a lifetime of experience with black voters, I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters,” an apparent allusion to yet another story of Buttigieg’s clumsy efforts. Even Amy Klobuchar, who’s been one of the most critical voices of Buttigieg’s inexperience, demurred when asked early on to expand on those criticisms.

It took until the closing stretch of the evening in Georgia for Klobuchar to finally go there — “I have won statewide, and mayor, I have appreciation for all your good work as a local official,” she said, “I also have actually done this work, I think experience should matter” — before Tulsi Gabbard unexpectedly swooped in with a critique of a recent Buttigieg quote about military cooperation with Mexico.

It was hardly the Buttigieg pile-on the candidate’s team, and the media, was expecting.

That’s because his opponents are still trying to figure out what kind of front-runner he is.

A few hours before the debate, a senior Joe Biden campaign official insisted that Buttigieg’s voters in Iowa were far from locked in for the mayor, and that they were still eminently winnable for the former vice-president because even sympathetic Iowans were not yet convinced Buttigieg could ultimately beat Trump. The mayor’s current strong standing, in other words, is not necessarily sustainable in the eyes of some of his competitors, who are waiting to see if it crumbles on its own before they force the issue and accidentally give Buttigieg an extra moment or two in the spotlight — like Gabbard ended up doing in the night’s final moments. “@PeteButtigieg has been the best debater in the previous debates. So what do you do to not give him a moment for writers to write about? You don’t attack him. You don’t treat him as a surging candidate,” tweeted Michael Ceraso, Buttigieg’s former New Hampshire state director, before that exchange. “Smart play by all the candidates.”

And while many of the other candidates entered the debate hoping Buttigieg would be knocked down a peg, few of them saw any individual incentive to be the one to actually do it — and risk turning off crucial voters and donors who are currently on Buttigieg’s side and view him very favorably. Asked earlier in the day if Biden would take on the issue of Buttigieg’s youth, which would appear to be an obvious line of attack for the longest-tenured pol in the field, another of his senior staffers said it was unlikely: All contrasts onstage would probably be implicit. “There is an inherent comparison there,” the aide said.

Campaigns, though, do not revolve solely around debates, and Buttigieg and his opponents alike now still expect him to come in for a round of real-time vetting.

In South Bend, his team is still working on figuring out what potential lines of attack his rivals might take within the three general vulnerabilities they’ve identified, now that the scrutiny-free stage of his campaign is over. “The campaign did not want a target on its back,” said one wired-in Buttigieg ally, a political veteran with experience with multiple presidential campaigns. But, he said, this moment in the sun was always coming: “It was always genuinely my belief he was way undervalued by the market because people were driven by national polls, and there was this narrative that Joe Biden is a decent guy who will not alienate working-class whites and that is the way to defeat Donald Trump. And it sort of overlooked, How is Biden when he has to interact with other human beings?”

Buttigieg has said he is trying to get released from a nondisclosure agreement with McKinsey, which would allow him to explain the true nature of his work for the consulting giant that has a history of contracting with dubious clients, both domestically and abroad. For now, said another (hopeful) Democrat close to the Buttigieg camp, “It’s hard to hit him with an integrity question — he doesn’t have a long record and he comes across as a good dude.” Yet the candidate has found no easy answer but to release tax returns disclosing his income — an attempt to deflect attention to Elizabeth Warren’s corporate law work hasn’t really worked. In the meantime, opponents will continue to raise questions about what’s essentially a glaring unknown on his short résumé.

And his answer to Klobuchar’s experience knock onstage was effective — “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters, there’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?” the 37-year-old said, before talking about his deployment. Even those close to him think he may need more than that, though none of them are sure what that should look like, or how to accomplish that without detracting from the central premise of his campaign: that he represents a generational change.

Perhaps his biggest challenge, though, is not an incoming line of attack, but a more fundamental issue: his meager support among black voters, who make up a huge portion of the Democratic primary electorate after the first two states vote.

It’s not the kind of issue that can be solved with a convincing debate-stage retort, Buttigieg’s allies acknowledge, though his rivals’ apparent willingness to talk about it on the campaign trail, if not the nationally televised stage, shows no signs of abating. So the urgency of his problem is only growing.

Buttigieg didn’t start building up a meaningful presence in South Carolina, the first state in the primary process where black voters represent a majority of the electorate, until late summer and early fall, and he is now figuring out what it will take to try to make a respectable showing there in February. He’s been stuck at zero percent support among the state’s black voters, but in the coming weeks he will likely spend considerable time in South Carolina trying to change that, multiple Democrats briefed on strategic conversations predicted.

In the view of the optimists in the mayor’s newly ballooning orbit, much of the other knocks on him come from jealousy and frustration. (“It’s the same dynamic that existed among the insiders about Obama in ’07,” one Buttigieg donor said to me before the debate.) This concern is the real one."

Here we are again. For the fifth time in five months, a bafflingly numerous bunch of Democratic presidential candidates just spent two hours engaged in the talking points-recitation competition we call a “debate” in our sorry excuse for a democracy. And now, once again, you’re shouting into the void (and/or, Google’s search bar), demanding answers to questions like “Who won the Democratic debate?” or “Who were the winners of the Democratic debate?” And you expect me, or someone like me — a college-educated, New York City-based journalist who reads about politics all day every day, and is thus uniquely unqualified to see this tedious carnival through the eyes of the median Democratic voter — to tell you what it all added up to, in the end.

Well, if you insist. Here are the five winners of last night’s fifth Democratic debate:

1) Cory Booker.

The New Jersey senator has made a regular habit of (figuratively) disembowling Joe Biden in the most jovial way imaginable. At debate after debate, like a psychopathic Ned Flanders, Booker has gone medieval on the old man without ever ceasing to smile or spout cringe-inducingly corny one-liners. In August, Booker took Biden to task for his record on criminal justice while dropping witticisms like, “You’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor.”

On Wednesday, Booker was at it again, ripping Biden’s failure to fully unlearn his drug-warrior ways while quipping, “This week, I hear [Biden] literally say that ‘I don’t think we should legalize marijuana’ — I thought you might have been high when you said it!”

Booker: “Marijuana is already legal for privileged people. The war on drugs has been a war on Black & Brown people.

Now, Booker has racked up more critically acclaimed debate performances this year than percentage points of voter support. The safe assumption is that his latest cheerful assault will prove as politically impotent as the previous ones. But there’s at least one reason to think his latest jab at Biden might prove more potent: Whereas previous attacks on the Democratic frontrunner have focused on Biden’s historic betrayals of contemporary Democratic orthodoxy — or else, the former vice-president’s spurning of today’s progressive vanguard — Booker targeted an issue where the elder statesman is truly behind the times: Two thirds of the American public supports marijuana legalization. Among Democratic primary voters, that percentage is even higher. Virtually every non-Biden candidate, from Amy Klobuchar to Bernie Sanders, is high on legal weed. Biden’s reluctance to make peace with marijuana legalization, like his constant struggles to find his way around an English sentence, is a reminder that there may be some downsides to nominating the oldest moderate on offer.

It really shook things up.

Amy Klobuchar’s hair is like jello pic.twitter.com/51a6FZDTbR — April Smith 🌱 (@aprul_april) November 21, 2019

3) Pete Buttigieg.

The South Bend mayor entered Wednesday’s debate riding high. In recent weeks, Buttigieg’s support has surged in both Iowa and New Hampshire. In the Hawkeye State, the most recent Des Moines Register poll found mayor Pete leading the Democratic field by ten points. Buttigieg’s rise was widely attributed to Elizabeth Warren’s recent decline, which was itself an ostensible product of the barrage of attacks her campaign had attracted following its own polling surge a little over a month ago. Thus, conventional wisdom held that Wednesday would be Pete’s turn to run the gauntlet: Surely, low-polling center-left candidates would relish this opportunity to expose the wunderkind for the underqualified, overpolished, ladder-climbing, backbiting McKinsey consultant he truly is.

But that didn’t happen. Instead, Kamala Harris & Co. all played the debate equivalent of the prevent defense. Even when moderators tried to bait the California senator into taking a swipe at Buttigieg, she largely resisted. Apparently, while everyone wants to see Pete get taken down a notch, no one wants to sign up for that task themselves, given his high favorability numbers among Democratic voters.

The only candidate who really went after Pete Wednesday was Tulsi Gabbard — who also chose to frame herself as a staunch opponent of the Democratic Party.

With enemies like that, Pete doesn’t need friends.

4) People who are not professionally obligated to watch Democratic primary debates.

I’m so tired.

5) Joe Biden.

The former vice-president began his debate night in the early afternoon — when his campaign asked its supporters if he had made them proud at the future debate that had just passed.

""I’m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now,"" Biden says in email to supporters hours before the debate has started pic.twitter.com/QrtoWlCgZP — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) November 20, 2019

Biden’s actual performance was about as smooth and coherent as that email. The Democratic frontrunner couldn’t even get through the first two sentences of his opening statement without stumbling, his remarks beginning with a tautology and ending in gibberish: “The next president of the United States is going to have to do two things: Defeat Donald Trump, that’s number one. And, number two, going to have to be able make be …”

Later, he argued that the only way to solve the problem of sexual violence was to “keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.” He looked and sounded too old to be out past 10 p.m., let alone, to be president of the United States for at least four years, beginning over one year from now.

Which is exactly how he has looked and sounded in all of his previous debate performances. And yet, he still boasts a double-digit lead in national polls over his closest competitor, while no other candidate has showed any sign of threatening his grip on the African-American vote. So, this was, ostensibly, the ideal debate showing. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like:

As is often the case, Politico nicely summed up the conventional wisdom going into the fifth presidential candidates’ debate in Atlanta:

Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. And that makes the debate a serious threat for him …

“Everyone’s going to come for Pete. There’s a target on his back — no question about it. That’s what happens when you jump in the polls,” said Jon Soltz, executive director of VoteVets, a progressive group that backs veterans for office but hasn’t endorsed in the presidential primary.

Buttigieg, after all, has been surging in Iowa and New Hampshire polls, and is reportedly drawing support from the previous candidate-on-fire Elizabeth Warren, while cutting off oxygen to a passel of low-polling candidates who are yearning to be the centrist alternative to Biden. And Biden himself has to fear that the shadowy but powerful group of donors and opinion leaders who have been frantically looking for a Plan B to his own self will decide Mayor Pete will work just fine.

But nobody other than Tulsi Gabbard — at the very end — went after Buttigieg at all. Indeed, while you can make a case that Warren or Klobuchar or Booker or Sanders did better than Buttigieg in Atlanta, he did just fine (He also did fine in his tangle with Gabbard) and the expected pile-on just didn’t happen.

Why didn’t anyone but Gabbard go after him? In my own article on Buttigieg’s “moment,” I wondered if he was peaking too soon, particularly in Iowa — a question that might be lingering in the minds of his rivals. Perhaps a couple of state polls wasn’t enough to convince them that Petementum is real. It’s also possible that his perpetual and well-documented problem in attracting nonwhite support makes his candidacy seem less formidable, and making him a less inviting target. Even if he does well in the heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, it’s quite possible he will have trouble carrying that momentum over to South Carolina and other southern, northeastern, and midwestern states, not to mention California.

Mayor Pete’s improbably successful campaign is improbably floating above the fray — at least for now. But if Buttigieg’s poll standings stay aloft heading toward the end of the year, the odds of him escaping the December debate in Los Angeles without taking fire from every direction will be low. And as the Iowa Caucuses grow nigh, if Buttigieg is barnstorming across that state as his senatorial allies are stuck in an impeachment trial in Washington, they may wish they had taken him down a notch earlier."

Young people who do not go to college tend to be more economically disadvantaged than those who do. This is not solely a function of rising tuition costs. For one thing, the peripheral costs of college attendance — from lost wages to books to housing — are often more formidable obstacles for working-class kids than tuition. For another, children from low-income households are not merely less likely to attend a university, but also, to be eligible to attend one, due to class disparities in high-school graduation rates. Separately, Americans who do have the opportunity to attend college generally enjoy higher incomes and living standards later in life than those who do not.

The U.S. economy does not have an insatiable demand for college-educated labor. According to federal projections, most of the fastest-growing occupations in the U.S. do not require a four-year degree. This means that we need a significant percentage of our young people to accrue forms of knowledge, skill, and experience that colleges aren’t designed to provide. If young Americans with little interest in — or aptitude for — higher education did not exist, we would need to invent them.

Given these realities, one can reasonably argue that tuition-free college should not be a priority of the progressive movement. To the extent that the next Democratic president’s capacity to enact new laws is constrained by Congress’s legislative calendar and moderates’ limited appetite for new spending, there will ostensibly be more progressive things for him or her to spend $70 billion on than a social benefit that America’s most disadvantaged young people are ineligible for, almost by definition.

On the other hand, this same basic logic could have been deployed in opposition to tuition-free 12th grade a generation ago (after all, the most disadvantaged students drop out before senior year). If we believe that the value of public education isn’t limited to its function as a generator of human capital or labor-force readiness — and thus, that it does not merely benefit its direct recipients but also, society as a whole — then the distributional implications of tuition-free college don’t necessarily matter. (In my own view, the growing correlation between college-degree attainment and immunity to xenophobic nationalism strengthens the case for seeing higher education as a broad social good.)

And anyway, as Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project has argued, there are ways to integrate free public college into a more inclusive, universalist program for helping young adults refine their skills and attach to the labor force:

[W]e should as a society designate ages 18–24 as the attachment zone during which all paths into a career are fully supported by public benefits and services. Students get their free school. But, under the exact same umbrella, nonstudents get their free vocational training, subsidized apprenticeships, in-work subsidies, public jobs, and whatever else it takes to ensure a lasting labor force attachment. That would be a program that is actually in fitting with the ideals of universalism.

All of which is to say: There are worthwhile intra-Democratic debates to be had over tuition-free college, including ones that interrogate its distributional impacts.

But Pete Buttigieg’s latest broadside against the policy is not one of them:

Instead of providing free college tuition for the children of millionaires and billionaires, I will open doors of opportunity for Americans who choose not to go to college with massive investments in apprenticeships, workforce training, and lifelong learning programs. — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) November 19, 2019

The serious distributional critique of free college is not that it would benefit the children of “billionaires,” but that it would deliver less benefit to the poor than it would to the upper-middle class. But the upper-middle class is Mayor Pete’s core constituency. And so, his campaign has chosen to argue that the only thing preventing the superrich from flooding our public universities with their progeny is the exorbitant cost of out-of-state tuition.

Now, if Pete had restricted his complaint to millionaires, he’d have something closer to a point. (Many upper-middle-class families do own more than $1 million in assets.) According to the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal, children whose parents are in the top one percent of earners would commandeer a whopping 1.4 percent of spending on tuition-free college. It’s hard to see why that sum should be a dealbreaker, especially if the policy is funded with higher taxes on the rich. Still, it isn’t literally nothing.

If Konczal restricted his estimates to billionaires however, it would be pretty darn close to zero percent. There are just over 600 billionaires in the entire United States, and they are not known for sending their kids to public schools. At present, the average cost of out-of-state tuition at a public university in the U.S. is $25,000. As a percentage of one’s spending power, $25,000 is for a (low-digit) billionaire what one movie ticket is for the median American household. It’s ludicrous to think that making public college tuition-free would cause billionaires to send their kids to public universities in droves, especially when one considers that once public higher education is tuition-free, a public-college diploma will be an even weaker marker of elite status than it already is.

And yet, the biggest problem with Pete’s fear of Americans’ footing the bill for the college-bound children of billionaires may be this: If it were actually true that making public college tuition-free would cause billionaire trust-fund kids to start sharing classrooms and social circles with working-class adolescents, that would make the case for tuition-free college stronger. After all, reams of educational research has shown low-income students derive massive benefits from attending schools with more privileged peers. Redistribute billionaire children from selective private colleges to public universities, and you’ll have progressively redistributed large sums of social capital, while rendering America’s institutions of higher education more socioeconomically diverse. Pete Buttigieg, of all people, should see the virtue in that outcome: After all, the South Bend Mayor has proposed a national service program aimed at getting America’s young people out of their “distinct bubbles.”

Tuition-free public college won’t deliver much of any benefit to the children of billionaires. But it would be an even more worthwhile program if it did."

Gabriel Debenedetti, Intelligencer’s national political correspondent, attended the Democratic debate in Atlanta Wednesday night. I spoke with him about his impressions from an evening that came at the end of a long day of political drama in Washington — and seemed to suffer for it at times.

Ben: Given that we did a whole chat about how Pete Buttigieg would be the central target of attack at Wednesday night’s debate and then that didn’t really happen (except when Tulsi Gabbard rather incoherently went after him toward the end), I feel I have to begin there. Why didn’t everyone pile on the mayor, as expected?

Gabriel: Well, I’ll have a full story on this tomorrow (check back, folks!), but the short answer is that the other candidates basically calculated that while they want to see Buttigieg fall, it wasn’t in any of their individual interests to be the one to carry out the take-down. We saw something similar the first time Warren was considered a front-runner a few months ago — the real fire came the next debate.

Ben: Set your clocks to December 19, the date of the next debate. That is, if Buttigieg is still leading in Iowa at that point.

Gabriel: But don’t, like, sleep until then. There’s a lot going on, Ben!

Ben: The online consensus seemed to be that this debate — at least for most of its running time — lacked the spark and energy of some previous installments, almost as if the candidates were as tired as political journalists who had spent all day covering impeachment. (Not to make it about us or anything.) From your vantage point down there in Atlanta, did you feel the same way?

Gabriel: Here in the media filing center, it certainly felt like everyone was waiting for … something that just didn’t happen. But a lot of the debates have felt like that, in person. There were certainly lots of spicy moments, when you think back on it, but it’s hard to point to any one, or any single exchange that’s certain to break through in the daily news coverage. Feels inevitable that Gordon Sondland’s testimony — and tomorrow’s impeachment developments — have that space locked down.

Ben: The spiciest exchange may have been Tulsi Gabbard versus Kamala Harris, who went after the Hawaiian for cozying up with Steve Bannon and ragging on the Democratic party. That duo wasn’t exactly on the marquee.

Gabriel: Tulsi Gabbard versus Pete Buttigieg was also quite an event there at the end, and Cory Booker had a few memorable lines, there, too. But if we’ve learned one lesson from these debates, it’s maybe that it’s really very difficult to predict what’s going to matter to, or stick with, the actual voters.

Ben: In that vein, Joe Biden looked a little groggy at the beginning there, but, unlike in previous debates, seemed to gain strength as the night wore on. He did have a couple of cringey moments — he said violence against women was never okay but then specified that there’s an exception if it’s self-defense, and he said he had earned support from the only black woman ever elected to the Senate, seeming to forget that Kamala Harris was standing feet away. But given that similar or worse gaffes on debate stages have done nothing to dent his support, it seems unlikely that these will.

Gabriel: I think we’re well past the point where rival campaigns are expecting Biden’s gaffes, if that’s what we’re going to call them, to materially change the shape of things. And in fact, Team Biden is likely to be pretty happy with the way this shaped up — they were very eager to have Biden talk foreign policy on a national debate stage at some point.

Ben: To my eyes, nobody really damaged themselves in any major way, except maybe Gabbard — Warren and Bernie both turned in strong performances, Buttigieg did what he had to do. And some of the non-frontrunners did quite well, too. Klobuchar had an excellent night, Andrew Yang had some good moments, and Kamala Harris turned in her best performance in months. Do you think anyone who really needed a boost helped their case particularly well? (And do you disagree with any of the assessments I laid out?)

Gabriel: Fair to say Gabbard may have made it difficult for herself to gain a ton of new voters tonight, but her own core supporters tend to like performances like these, so I’m not sure she’ll see the evening as a terrible disaster. However, I think Booker in particular will be happy with his time onstage. He’s the one who maybe needed the most help to get on the next debate stage, and his ad-libbed closing — invoking John Lewis — seemed to really hit home here.

Ben: Oh right, him! He was good, too.

Gabriel: … and therein lies his problem."

Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, E.U. ambassador Gordon Sondland’s impeachment testimony, last night’s Democratic debate, and Prince Andrew’s disastrous interview.

In yesterday’s impeachment testimony, Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised his earlier statements, saying that he “followed the president’s orders” and summing up, simply, “Was there a ‘quid pro quo’? … The answer is yes.” How damaging is Sondland’s testimony for the Republicans’ defense of Trump?

If the Republicans cared about the facts or the gravity of the crime being investigated, the answer would be apocalyptically damaging. But they don’t care, and they will continue to defend Trump even if those testifying under oath include an eyewitness to a criminal conspiracy hatched in the White House like Sondland, or patriots like Fiona Hill, Alexander Vindman, and Marie Yovanovitch, who not only provided irrefutable evidence of the crime but detailed the existential threat that crime poses to America.

Had Trump pulled out that (so far) proverbial gun and shot someone on Fifth Avenue, Republicans would trot out the exact same defense they have this week: The shot was fired at 2 a.m. and there were no eyewitnesses. Those nearby who claimed to have heard the shot had actually heard a car backfiring. The closed-circuit video capturing the incident is, as the president says, a hoax concocted by the same Fake News outlets that manufactured the Access Hollywood video. The confession released by the White House was “perfect” evidence of Trump’s innocence. Election records show that the cops who arrived on the scene were registered Democrats and therefore part of a deep-state conspiracy to frame the president for a crime he didn’t commit but that the Democrats did. The victim was not killed and will make a complete recovery, so no crime was committed anyway. And even if Trump had killed the young woman he gunned down, the argument advanced by Trump’s lawyer last month would apply: “The person who serves as president, while in office, enjoys absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind.” Next case!

The crime Trump actually is accused of is far more severe than that imaginary shooting in any event. He and his co-conspirators, including the vice-president and secretary of State, were guilty of aiding Vladimir Putin’s plan to bludgeon Ukraine, an American ally, and, in Fiona Hill’s language, “to weaken our country” as well. That Putin’s foremost goal is to sabotage the electoral process that is the beating heart of our democracy doesn’t seem to matter a whit to Vichy Republicans. If the devastating facts unfurled with great clarity by Adam Schiff’s committee has failed to move them, what would? History — particularly the history of the prominent political figures in England, France, and the United States who appeased and collaborated with Germany during the Nazis rise to power — suggests that they will only be moved to speak up when it’s too late.

Last night’s Democratic debate was the first held since Pete Buttigieg has climbed into the top tier of candidates, and attempted to weather the level of scrutiny that comes with that position. How did he do?



The proof that no one knows what the hell is happening at this point in the Democratic primary was the nearly uniform pre-debate prediction by journalists and politicians that the evening’s main event would be Buttigieg takedowns. Eyeing Mayor Pete’s rise in polling in his state, the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack put it this way earlier this week: “He may be able to take a punch. He may not. We just don’t know.” And we still don’t. Except for a scuffle with the soon-to-depart Tulsi Gabbard in the final moments, Buttigieg received at most light taps from his actual rivals and deflected them with ease. That said, to me his easy-listening unflappability still seems to be the voice of a McKinsey consultant, which he once was.

One thing we can all agree on is that the Democrats will not win if they bore the electorate to tears. Yes, many voters may be looking to swing the pendulum away from a president whose style is to compulsively provide entertainment (or at least his brand of it) 24/7. But the overall inability of the candidates to engage with each other passionately before a national television audience last night leaves you wondering how much they are engaging even with the core audience tuning into a debate broadcast on MSNBC.

Did anyone learn anything new last night? Bernie Sanders continues to bounce back impressively from his heart attack. The debate did not illuminate where Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All plan stands after the seeming hedging of recent days. Joe Biden still cannot get through an unrehearsed answer without slipping into incoherence, irrelevance, or both. Amy Klochubar still can’t quit making scripted quips that she delivers as if to emphasize how canned they are (last night’s: “I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends”). While Cory Booker declared that he is not looking for “a kumbaya moment” as president, he still conveys the sunny, broad good will of kumbaya more successfully than any compelling policy ideas. Kamala Harris’s tough prosecutorial intelligence continues to lack a third dimension onstage. The best to be said about Tom Steyer is that he’s not Howard Schultz. In the novelty spot, Andrew Yang is not nearly as fascinating as Marianne Williamson.

Even though Michael Bloomberg has scant chance of winning the Democratic nomination, he couldn’t jump in soon enough. He’s a billionaire who has actually done things in public life — good, bad, and indifferent. His long record and his money will shake things up. The Democratic field needs a jolt. To use a Biden metaphor from a previous debate, watching this one was like listening to a record player when the needle is stuck.

In the wake of a disastrous BBC interview about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew has announced that he will “step back from public duties” for the near future. Will this decision shield him from further repercussions?



A British friend of mine observes that Prince Andrew’s BBC interview has united her country for the first time since Brexit. No one believed him, and no viewer was left unappalled. I don’t know what “further repercussions” could befall him even if there was evidence that he raped a girl in Epstein’s Manhattan mansion. I’m no lawyer, but wouldn’t this require the Palace to allow his extradition to the United States? In any case, as a public figure, the prince is done, except as a possible role for Ricky Gervais in season five of The Crown.

I’m much more interested in the repercussions for the various see-no-evil, hear-no-evil American Establishment figures who hung out with Epstein, in some cases took his money and favors or gave him money and favors, and are skating away (or trying to): Alan Dershowitz, Leslie Wexner, and Leon Black most of all in terms of documented interaction with Epstein, but also such hangers-on as Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, not to mention the Harvard retinue led by Larry Summers and Steven Pinker. Go to YouTube, watch the roughly 50-minute Prince Andrew interview in its entirety, and imagine all these American Establishment men being subjected to a similarly rigorous inquiry. It will chill the blood."

Davis. Photo: NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images

When weird stuff happens in politics, it sometimes seems appropriate to resort to weird theories in order to explain it all. That’s probably what drove The New Republic’s Alex Pareene to speculate that late entries into the 2020 presidential contest by Mike Bloomberg and Deval Patrick represent a gamble by shadowy Democratic elites on a “brokered convention” in Milwaukee next July.

[T]his is the only way these two late entrants make any sense. The Patrick and Bloomberg campaigns are not mere long-shots, or attempts to harm Sanders or Warren on behalf of the moderates. They are calculated bets on a brokered convention. These are well-connected people at the highest levels of Democratic Party politics (despite his independent status, Bloomberg has always surrounded himself with Democratic campaign veterans and aides), making it clear that they believe there is a real chance that the nomination will be completely up for grabs next July.

Pareene makes it clear he is not predicting this outcome, but is simply trying to understand why two smart pols surrounded by smart people would launch such doomed candidacies. And he’s right: neither Bloomberg nor Patrick has anything like a plausible path to the nomination via conventional means. He doesn’t really explain why anyone would think a deadlocked convention packed with delegates originally pledged to candidates who are mostly to the left of these gentlemen would turn to either of them. Perhaps Bloomberg and Patrick have more confidence in the power of the Democratic Establishment than I have; hence the alleged belief (which I do not share) that there is someone in a position to “broker” a contested convention.

But let’s just put that aside and discuss exactly how, mechanically, these candidacies would keep Democratic voters from choosing a nominee before the convention, as they have regularly done since the big switch to elected rather than appointed delegates prior to 1972.

The biggest risk of a contested convention would arise from a logjam of multiple candidates with different but relatively even bases of support who are accumulating enough delegates to make staying the course sensible. The institutional mechanism Democrats have for keeping that from happening is the 15-percent threshold for winning delegates at all (at either the statewide or congressional-district level; the precise mix varies from state to state). Additional, well-funded candidacies at this late date are likely to reduce, not increase, the odds of multiple rivals staying above 15 percent for an extended length of time, while also making it harder for some dark horse (e.g., Amy Klobuchar) to achieve viability before it’s too late.

Let’s look at some specific scenarios. Patrick will almost certainly begin his campaign with a near-exclusive focus on New Hampshire, where he is a familiar figure due to his longtime presence on Boston TV. If he does relatively well, from whom will he draw votes? Probably from Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, and the various quasi-centrist bottom-feeders in the field who may be struggling to survive by then. It’s unlikely anything other than Biden’s own mouth (and probably not even that) can knock him out of the race that early, but Mayor Pete could be in peril of heading toward extremely difficult contests in Nevada and South Carolina, mortally wounded if he underperforms in New Hampshire. But in any event, Patrick will either do so poorly that no contested convention would even begin to think of turning to him, or he’ll help winnow the field, which makes a contested convention even less likely than ever.

Bloomberg’s strategy, if he has one, is to spend giant buckets of money in the Super Tuesday states where rivals won’t have the wherewithal to compete everywhere. But again, his presence is more likely to knock a survivor or two of the early-state gauntlet below the threshold for winning delegates than to prevent the emergence of a front-runner. And let’s say Bloomberg does really well on Super Tuesday. That would likely produce a consolidation of progressive voters determined to keep an ex-Republican billionaire from buying the nomination. Assuming Sanders and Warren both remain viable after South Carolina, a Bloomberg threat could force many of their supporters to choose between them once and for all. Again, the effect might be to winnow the field and keep others from rising to viability.

I think the more realistic scenario is that Deval Patrick vanishes without a trace after New Hampshire, and Bloomberg becomes simply a giant dollar sign representing a warning to progressives that they’d better not get too carried away with their attacks on the financial sector and other wealthy pockets of “centrist” sentiment. Pareene considers and rejects the idea that either of the late entrants is in the race strictly to damage Sanders or Warren. But there’s no question that if he chose to do so, Bloomberg could go after either or both of them with the most expensive negative ad campaign in political history (along with direct attacks during candidate debates, if he can buy his way onto the stage). What would that produce? Well, either the final “struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party” that pundits long for almost as much as a “brokered convention,” or the rise of a unity candidate, who would not be named Michael Bloomberg or Deval Patrick. If Democratic elites really do think they can manipulate Democratic voters into producing a contested convention and then a coup in Milwaukee, they are about to find out how imaginary their power actually is."

To show this, I draw on data from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape — a weekly survey of more than 6,000 Americans. In this survey, as in most national surveys, Americans generally favor the major Democratic candidates over Trump.

For example, in the Oct. 24-30 weekly survey , those who say they are registered and intend to vote in 2020 prefer Joe Biden over Trump by 52 percent to 40 percent. Several other candidates for the Democratic nomination are also leading Trump, including Bernie Sanders (51-42), Elizabeth Warren (49-42), Pete Buttigieg (46-40), and Kamala D. Harris (46-42). These numbers haven’t changed a great deal since mid-July, when this survey project began.

If the candidates who perform better in match-ups are actually more electable, this survey suggests that Biden is most likely to defeat Trump.

AD

AD

But here’s why that is misleading: How Democratic candidates perform in these match-ups depends a lot on name recognition. While Biden and Sanders have spent considerable time on the national stage, Americans know less about other candidates.

For example, when asked whether they have a favorable or unfavorable view of these candidates, a significant number of Americans say they “haven’t heard enough” about Buttigieg (40 percent), Harris (25 percent), and Warren (18 percent). By contrast, fewer than 1 in 10 Americans say the same about Biden (9 percent) and Sanders (6 percent).

As it turns out, there is a strong negative relationship between the percentage of people saying they “haven’t heard enough” about a candidate and that candidate’s performance against Trump. In weekly data from mid-July through October, it’s clear that the better-known Democratic candidates are generally performing better than their lesser-known counterparts.

In other words, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg’s low name recognition is making them look less electable than they truly are. If their name recognition were to increase — as it certainly would if they won the Democratic nomination — polls could show that they would do as well against Trump as the candidates who are now better known.

AD

AD

Does this mean that all the candidates would do just as well if they were equally well known? Not necessarily. Biden and Sanders provide an excellent example. Despite being slightly better known, Sanders actually performs somewhat worse against Trump than Biden does. At this point in the race, Biden appears to be more electable than Sanders. This raises a question for candidates like Warren, Harris or Buttigieg: If their name recognition increased, would they look more like Biden or Sanders when matched against Trump? In each case, about a quarter of those saying they hadn’t heard enough about a candidate for the Democratic nomination also did not know how they would vote in a match-up between that candidate and Trump. In other words, these voters are doubly undecided — they don’t have an opinion of the Democratic candidate and do not have a preference between this candidate and Trump.

As a thought experiment, I looked at whether these voters had a more favorable opinion of Trump or “Democrats.” I assumed those with a more favorable opinion of Democrats would ultimately vote for the Democratic candidate once they learned more about the person. I assumed that those who had a more favorable opinion of Trump would ultimately vote for him.

This exercise increased Harris’s margin over Trump slightly (from four points to five points) but increased Buttiegieg’s margin even more (from six points to 10 points). Warren’s stayed the same (eight points). Thus at least some Democratic candidates may be more electable than they appear. At the same time, Biden retains a larger lead over Trump (12 points).

AD

AD

As the Democratic primary campaign continues, match-up polls will undoubtably continue to fuel the debate about electability. But we should take those polls with a grain of salt. Although they may reveal something about electability, they’re also exaggerating the differences among the Democratic candidates in how they would perform against Trump.

Pete Buttigieg is polling incredibly well in Iowa. And the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did nearly everything possible during the fifth Democratic debate to try to boost his support even more in the big corn-growing state -- by repeatedly hammering how farmers can be part of the solution to climate change.

Buttigieg spent much of Wednesday evening honing an environmental message designed to cast farmers as a key group in battling climate change, more than perhaps any other candidate on stage during the debate hosted by The Washington Post and MSNBC in Atlanta.

""American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change,"" Buttigieg said. That message, he added, is a good way of recruiting ""everybody to be part of the solution, including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging they're part of the problem.""

This message may resonate in nation's first state to vote in the Democratic primary: A recent Des Moines Register-CNN poll showed Buttigieg surging with support from 25 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden all behind the small city mayor in essentially a three-way tie at about 15 percent support.

When asked about President Trump's subsidies to farmers amid a trade war with China, Buttigieg pivoted to a part of his $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion climate plan to support farmers and ranchers in adopting management techniques that capture carbon dioxide from the air.

""I believe that the quest for the carbon-negative farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country,"" Buttigieg said during the debate.

Buttigieg also called out Trump for exempting dozens of oil refineries from having to blend biofuels — notably, corn-based ethanol — into their gasoline. Renewable fuel policy means little outside the nation's Corn Belt, but it is perennially a high-priority issue in Iowa, which grows more corn than any other state.

""Look, I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers,"" Buttigieg said.

Like many other Midwestern states earlier this year, Iowa was hit with catastrophic floods of the sort which will become more frequent and severe as the world continues to warm.

In the past, Buttigieg has made that connection when campaigning in Iowa. ""Rural communities — from river towns to tribal lands to farms — are on the front lines of climate change,"" the candidate wrote in an op-ed in August in the Des Moines Register, the state's largest newspaper. ""Yet too often, rural Americans are told they’re part of the problem.""

Buttigieg's momentum in Iowa, as well as in New Hampshire where polling also shows him up, put a target on his back during the debate. But Buttigieg escaped unscathed. His biggest tussle of the night was with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). ""That’s about the best he could have hoped for, given her limited constituency in the Democratic Party,"" writes The Post's Aaron Blake.

Here are some of the other climate-related moments from the debate:

Tom Steyer: The billionaire financier tried to cast himself as the ""climate candidate"" on stage (a la former presidential contender and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee), and claimed he was the only candidate to support declaring a state of emergency to address climate change. ""I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the No. 1 priority for me,"" he said. ""Vice President Biden won't say it."" But Sanders shot back that he too has put forward legislation calling for the use of emergency powers.

""I don't really need a kind of a lecture from — from my friend,"" Biden said, adding that by contrast he was among the first to introduce climate-related legislation in the Senate.

Bernie Sanders: At least three times during the debate, the Vermont independent peppered his answers to non-climate questions with admonishments of fossil fuel interests. That included a call to prosecute oil, gas and coal executives who knew about the risks climate change posed. ""By the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable, because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet,"" he said.

— Energy Department disputes Sondland testimony: The Energy Department put out a statement pushing back on remarks U.S. ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland ​made before the House Intelligence Committee. During that blockbuster testimony, Sondland suggested Energy Secretary Rick Perry was familiar with efforts to put pressure on Ukraine for investigations into Trump's political opponents.

What Sondland said: He testified that he informed a number of top administration officials, including Perry, that the Ukrainian president would comply with Trump’s request for an investigation of the Ukrainian gas company where Joe Biden’s son was a member of the board. Sondland said he emailed officials, including Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, the week before a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — an email Sondland says Perry replied to.

Giuliani's role: Sondland also said Perry and former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker handled initial communications with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani — who has figured prominently in the Ukraine pressure campaign -- after a May meeting during which Trump directed them to ""talk to Rudy,"" as The Post's Aaron Blake writes. “Secretary Perry volunteered to make the initial calls with Mr. Giuliani, given their prior relationship,” Sondland said. He added: ""We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine.""

He added: ""We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine."" What the Energy Department says: “Ambassador Sondland's testimony today misrepresented both Secretary Perry's interaction with Rudy Giuliani and direction the Secretary received from President Trump,” a department spokesman said in a statement. “As previously stated, Secretary Perry spoke to Rudy Giuliani only once at the President's request. No one else was on that call. At no point before, during or after that phone call did the words 'Biden' or 'Burisma' ever come up in the presence of Secretary Perry.”

— Lawmakers scramble on advancing more bills before Thanksgiving break: The House Energy and Commerce Committee continued into a second day of markups and advanced a sweeping legislative package to address PFAS chemicals, a dangerous class of chemicals that has has long been used in products such as nonstick cookware and firefighting foam.

Details: The bipartisan PFAS Action Act from Michigan Reps. Debbie Dingell (D) and Fred Upton (R) combines 11 different bills and would in part require the Environmental Protection Agency to designate all per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous and provides grants for treatment technologies for PFAS-impacted drinking water systems.

Meanwhile: The House Natural Resources Committee held a markup and advanced a series of bills, including measures that designates more than a million acres of wilderness for protection in California and Colorado.

Myers told the Washington Times that he had surgery and chemotherapy for cancer and wrote to the administration to pull his nomination. Why he was controversial to begin with: “Myers’ nomination had languished in the Senate since it was first announced in November 2017, due in part to conflict of interest concerns regarding his family’s continued ownership stake in AccuWeather, the private weather forecasting company he led until stepping down on Jan. 1,” The Post’s Andrew Freedman and Jason Samenow reports.

— The latest on the controversial BLM relocation: The agency’s acting director notified employees that those who choose severance rather than relocate from Washington to new offices in Western states will have to leave their jobs by Jan. 31. In the email to staff, “acting Director William Pendley said eligible employees may begin applying for early retirement or voluntary separation incentive payments as early as next week,” the Hill reports. “…The email is just the latest sign that BLM will be proceeding with its controversial relocation despite objections from lawmakers, including a group yesterday who asked appropriators to block funding for the move.”

The National Weather Service predicted that the critical fire conditions will continue into part of Thursday. “Stay tuned — fire season is definitely not over yet until the region receives widespread wetting rainfall,” it warned. It's the fourth round of these blackouts in two months: ""PG&E Co. began shutting off power Wednesday morning in Napa and Sonoma counties, including parts of the city of Santa Rosa, where the Tubbs Fire in 2017 killed 22 people and destroyed over 5,000 structures,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “The blackouts will eventually affect around 150,000 customers in 18 counties, extending as far north as Shasta County and as far south as Solano County, a distance of over 200 miles.”

(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: Amy Klobuchar questioned last week whether a woman with Pete Buttigieg’s level of experience would be on a presidential debate stage. With the two Democratic candidates standing on such a stage last night in Atlanta, NBC’s Andrea Mitchell tried to tee up fireworks between the senior senator from Minnesota and the mayor of South Bend, Ind. But Klobuchar took a pass.

“Pete is qualified to be up on this stage, and I am honored to be standing next to him,” she responded. “But what I said is true. Women are held to a higher standard. Otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite female president, which we can’t do because it has all been men.”

Then Klobuchar delivered the most memorable line of the night. “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump,” she said, “Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.”

The crowd roared, and Buttigieg wasn’t asked to respond. It was a great moment for Klobuchar, who has struggled to translate impressive debate performances into grass-roots support, but her answer also spared a relatively untested candidate who has surged in the polls from what could have become a quite uncomfortable back-and-forth. Buttigieg, an openly gay white man, is seeking to become the standard-bearer of a diverse party whose most vocal activists have increasingly embraced identity politics.

The 37-year-old prepared for a barrage of intense attacks that didn’t materialize in the debate, which was hosted by The Washington Post and MSNBC. But now the presidential race will move to the backburner for the next few weeks as the national media, and many undecided Democratic voters, turn their focus back to the impeachment proceedings in Washington. The next debate doesn’t take place until Dec. 19 in Los Angeles.

A similar dynamic played out with Kamala Harris. On Monday, she criticized Buttigieg for using a stock photo of a mother and child from Kenya to promote his proposal for helping black Americans. She called it a “big mistake” that suggested he’s not ready to lead our polyglot republic. “I don’t have words to describe that,” Harris said. Another moderator, NBC’s Kristen Welker, brought up the topic and tried to get Harris to say more. But the junior senator from California declined. She said Buttigieg has apologized for the error, essentially letting him off the hook, and quickly pivoted to talk about her own plans to help black women.

And so it went. Buttigieg has been eating Joe Biden’s lunch in Iowa, yet the former vice president chose not to come after him. Cory Booker, plainly jealous that Buttigieg has seized the mantle of generational change that he hoped to carry in 2020, noted at one point during the debate that he too was a Rhodes Scholar and previously served as a mayor of Newark before representing New Jersey in the Senate. In a subtle dig, Booker mentioned that he led “the largest city in my state.” (South Bend is the fourth-most-populous city in Indiana.)

-- The only candidate who decided to really go after Buttigieg in an aggressive way was Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, perhaps the most useful possible foil for Buttigieg who was onstage. She claimed that he wants to send U.S. troops to fight drug cartels in Mexico. “That is outlandish,” Buttigieg replied. He accused her of taking him out of context. Then he attacked Gabbard for visiting Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, which he cited as proof of her poor judgment.

Earlier in the debate, after Gabbard criticized the Democratic Party for being overly interventionist, Harris ripped her for palling around with Assad and trekking to Trump Tower during the transition for a meeting with Steve Bannon amid speculation she might land a Cabinet appointment. “I think that it’s unfortunate that we have someone on the stage … who during the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,” Harris said. This laid the groundwork for Buttigieg’s clapback more than an hour later.

-- The debate underscored just how fluid the race remains. No one dominated this debate, including Buttigieg. The clashes were less ideological than before and more focused on electability. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick have taken steps to join the field because Biden has been a weaker candidate than they expected. The race has already been frozen in some important respects by the impeachment inquiry, making it harder for candidates to unveil new plans or to generate coverage for talking about anything other than President Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.

A Des Moines Register poll released over the weekend showed Buttigieg capturing the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, followed by essentially a three-way tie for second place between Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who all drew 15 percent. None of the other candidates are in double digits. But most voters say they’re not wedded to anyone. A more surprising Saint Anselm College poll released this week put Buttigieg up 10 points among likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire, as well, with 25 percent to 15 percent for both Warren and Biden, albeit with a smaller sample size.

-- Every candidate has distinct incentives with 75 days to go until Iowa caucuses. Because the field is so scattered, Warren, Sanders and Biden seemed more focused on promoting themselves than attacking anyone else. The senior senator from Massachusetts was barely attacked last night, certainly compared to last month’s debate, possibly because her rivals see her as wounded. Some wind has been coming out of her sails as she’s struggled to detail how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

Biden, celebrating his 77th birthday, struggled once again to deliver a decisive performance. One illustration of just how unsettled the race remains came when billionaire Tom Steyer accused Biden of not taking climate change seriously enough. The former vice president slammed Steyer for making millions off coal at a time when he was championing environmental legislation in the Senate. If Biden was more confident about his standing, he might have brushed off Steyer – a non-factor in this race – and merely touted his own record or plans for rejoining the Paris climate accord.

-- Even though Harris didn’t attack him on Wednesday night, Buttigieg has failed thus far to make inroads with African Americans, a struggle that continues to cast a cloud over the long-term viability of his candidacy. Despite those polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, two of the whitest states in the country, Quinnipiac University’s new South Carolina survey shows Buttigieg garnering less than one percent support among black voters – raising new questions about whether he can go the distance when the nominating contest moves to the South and, if he’s the nominee, whether he’ll be able to re-activate black voters who backed Barack Obama twice but stayed home when Hillary Clinton was on the ballot in 2016.

Buttigieg watched his words carefully, but he referred to being openly gay as he discussed racism. “While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,” he said.

Last night, though, no one mentioned the police shooting in his city that dogged him during a previous debate. But Buttigieg touted his stewardship of South Bend. “I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me – and before I share what's in my plans, let me talk about what's in my heart and why this is so important,” he said. “As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low-income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.”

Booker went after Biden, not Buttigieg, on the black vote. Perhaps because Biden actually has black support. He criticized Biden’s comments from the weekend about the dangers of legalizing marijuana as an example of how he doesn’t understand the issues affecting people of color. “I thought you might’ve been high when you said it,” Booker quipped. Biden said he wants to decriminalize marijuana. Biden then touted his support from the black community, but he mistakenly claimed that “the only black African American woman who had ever been elected to the United States Senate” supported him. “That’s not true,” Harris declared. Biden corrected himself to say that he meant “the first” black female senator supported him.

-- Buttigieg was pressed harder by the moderators than his rivals on his relative lack of governing experience. The mayor is wrapping up his second term as the chief executive of a city with just over 100,000 residents. Mitchell noted that Buttigieg was elected mayor with fewer than 11,000 votes, and he lost by 25 points when he ran for state treasurer. He also finished third in the race to chair the Democratic National Committee just last year. “Why,” Mitchell wondered, “should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he answered. “In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he's been appealing to.” Buttigieg boasted that a recent Forbes magazine list showed he’s “literally the least wealthy person on this stage.”

-- Buttigieg wants to position himself as the leading outsider candidate in the race, noting that his opponents onstage have served in Washington cumulatively for more than 100 years. The ongoing impeachment drama will give him an opportunity to sharpen this message, but that may resonate more in the context of a general election than a primary. Five of the 10 candidates onstage were senators who would be jurors in any impeachment trial. A sixth senator, Michael Bennet of Colorado, didn’t qualify for the debate but continues to essentially camp out in New Hampshire as he tries to make some magic happen.

The conventional wisdom among the chattering classes – and across most of the campaigns – is that the trial could become a frustrating distraction that keeps the senators away from Iowa and New Hampshire on the eve of voting. Perhaps that might become a problem if the trial really drags on. But it’s also possible that these races have become so nationalized – even in the early states – that all eyes would be on whatever’s happening in the Senate. And the six senators could get a helpful platform to showcase how they’re standing up to Trump, which is undoubtedly helpful in the context of a primary. In that way, it feels like an impeachment trial could become very beneficial for lower-tier candidates like Harris and Booker who are struggling to catch a break.

“I know that from the perspective of Washington what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small,” Buttigieg said. “The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small. And I believe we need to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience.”

THE LATEST ON IMPEACHMENT:

-- Fiona Hill, the former White House adviser on Russia, opened her testimony before the impeachment inquiry this morning with withering criticism of Republican attempts to sow doubt that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Hill’s testimony sets the stage for an extraordinary development in the impeachment hearings, with Trump’s former top adviser on Russia essentially telling the public under oath that his refusal to accept the reality of Moscow’s intervention in 2016 is wrong,” Greg Miller reports.

“This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services,” Hill said in her opening statement. “Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country. … The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions. It is beyond dispute.”

-- In the most damaging testimony yet for Trump, U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland said yesterday that there was a quid pro quo “with regard” to Ukraine. He explicitly linked the president, the vice president and other senior officials to what he described as a widely understood campaign to pressure a foreign government to investigate Joe Biden. Rachael Bade, Aaron C. Davis and Matt Zapotosky report: “More forcefully than he has before, Sondland declared that the Trump administration would not give Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a chance to visit the White House — unless Zelensky agreed to announce investigations that could help the president politically. ‘I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?’ Sondland said. ‘With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.’ …

“Sondland acknowledged that he and others were the ones pushing Ukrainians to announce investigations, but asserted they had merely ‘followed the president’s orders,’ communicated through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Sondland testified that top-level officials — including [Vice President] Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — were made aware at various points of what was happening, and he provided emails to back up his assertions. ‘Everyone,’ Sondland testified, ‘was in the loop.’ …

""In his defense, Trump zeroed in on one favorable, but misleading, part of how Sondland described a September phone call between the two. Sondland at the time had just received a text message from the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, worried that the White House was conditioning nearly $400 million in aid on the country committing to the investigations targeting Democrats. Sondland later replied in a text message … that the president wanted ‘no quid pro quo’s of any kind.’ Sondland testified last month, and again on Wednesday, that the phrase came directly from Trump in a phone call before he sent the text. … ‘I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,’ Sondland recalled Trump saying in the phone call. Trump carried with him handwritten notes of Sondland’s words as he spoke to reporters outside the White House. … Sondland testified Wednesday that he wished he’d typed the text differently back in September, using quotation marks to make clear the no quid pro quo phrase had come from Trump. It was ‘not artfully written,’ he said. …

“Sondland said that he, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Kurt Volker, at the time a special envoy to Ukraine, worked with Giuliani in pressing Ukraine ‘at the express direction of the president of the United States’ — even though they were reluctant to do so. At least initially, though, Sondland said he did not believe he was engaging in anything ‘improper’ — in part because he claimed he did not understand that Trump wanted an investigation of Biden. Other witnesses have disputed that account. … Sondland said Giuliani seemed more focused on getting Ukraine to publicly reveal the investigations, rather than actually carry them out, though he conceded official announcements would hold foreign officials to their word. … Sondland revealed an email showing that he asked Pompeo to help him orchestrate a face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelensky, off to the side of a World War II commemoration ceremony that the two were scheduled to attend in Poland on Sept. 1. … Days later, Trump decided not to travel to Warsaw ... Pence made the trip in place of Trump. Sondland claimed he informed the vice president before the meeting ‘that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations.’” (Pence's chief of staff denies that this happened.)

-- Sondland’s testimony left Trump’s Republican allies scrambling. Seung Min Kim, Josh Dawsey and Kayla Epstein report: “As he traveled on Air Force One to Texas, Trump called members of the House to argue that the testimony was good for him, according to an aide ... Trump also professed to reporters that he had little familiarity with Sondland, a major donor to his inauguration who testified that he had spoken with the president about 20 times. … On Sondland, key Republican allies sought to undermine the ambassador’s credibility, while insisting that the basic facts had not changed as to whether Trump had committed an impeachable offense by pressuring Ukraine to investigate [the Bidens]. ‘I say that he’s changed his story several times and one needs to be suspicious of that. But having said that, take what he says, compare it to the facts,’ Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday of Sondland. ‘I just know this: That [Ukraine] got the money, and Hunter Biden and Joe Biden weren’t investigated. That’s what I do know.’ … ‘Mike Turner’s ability to get Ambassador Sondland to say that he had not heard from anyone in the administration that would suggest that aid was tied to any investigations was really powerful and compelling,’ said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s most ardent defenders in the House. ...

“The White House sent 14 different sections of talking points to congressional Republicans, coming in at more than 3,300 words ... Included was a list of 10 times Sondland said he believed or presumed information to be true but could not prove it. … Other Trump allies sought to argue that, even if there was a quid pro quo as Sondland had testified, there were other factors to consider. ‘I don’t think the quid pro quo is the issue. If you’re talking about an illegal quid pro quo, there are legal and illegal quid pro quos,’ said Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.). ‘And an illegal quid pro would be based on a president’s intent.’ … White House aides said Sondland was the most damaging witness so far because he actually had interactions with Trump and described key issues in nefarious terms.""

-- Sondland appeared to embrace his role in history with nonchalance. Aaron C. Davis, Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey report: “As Sondland warmed up, sometimes smirking, joking and announcing casually that, yes, there had been a quid pro quo, it soon wasn’t clear what gravity he saw in the moment. … There was no somber rhetoric, no cancer on the presidency in his eyes — but rather a businessman for a president who had a transactional issue to solve: Trump wanted certain things from Ukraine, and vice versa. ‘Look,’ Sondland said, ‘we tried to fix the problem.’ … At some points, he even appeared to be having a good time. Asked about a phone call in which he was overheard giving Trump an encouraging report about the pressure campaign, Sondland seemed amused when read back an account of having told Trump that the president of Ukraine ‘loves your ass.’ ‘Sounds like something I would say,’ Sondland quipped. ‘That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words.’ Republicans took turns reading statements issued by [Perry] and Pence challenging Sondland’s testimony in near-real time. The ambassador sat still, smiling slightly, seemingly unfazed. At one point earlier this fall, Trump had praised Sondland as ‘a great American.’ On Wednesday, a lawmaker read Sondland the latest presidential comment: ‘This is not a man I know well.’ Sondland seemed unperturbed, saying with a chuckle, ‘Easy come, easy go.’”

-- By providing the committee with emails showing top administration officials were personally aware of or directly involved in the alleged quid pro quo, Sondland validated many Democratic suspicions. He also highlighted how much evidence has not been turned over, which gives Democrats usable evidence to substantiate a likely article of impeachment based on obstruction. Karoun Demirjian reports: “‘Based on a sample of the documents attached to Ambassador Sondland’s statement . . . we can see why Pompeo and [Trump] have made such a concerted and across-the-board effort to obstruct this investigation,’ Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said at Wednesday’s hearing. ‘They do so at their own peril: I remind the president that Article III of the impeachment articles drafted against President Nixon was his refusal to obey the subpoenas of Congress.’ …

""Sondland’s revelations implicated senior members of the Trump administration, and he made clear there are emails, phone records and documents that could have a bearing on the House impeachment investigation. But it is not clear whether House Democrats will run down all the new leads, as doing so would likely require them to issue new subpoenas and double down on existing ones in the courts. Democrats have repeatedly expressed a reluctance to get bogged down in legal proceedings, and leaders are committed to not losing the momentum of the public impeachment hearings, which are on course to feature a dozen witnesses in less than two weeks. Senior Democrats have indicated that the House is on track to vote on impeachment next month. Yet several members have acknowledged that there could be value in securing the testimony of holdouts like Pompeo and [Bolton], neither of whom have yet been subpoenaed for testimony.”

-- Sondland’s dramatic testimony undercut the president's version of events, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “He arrived for Wednesday’s hearing facing an obvious dilemma, which was to risk a charge of lying to Congress by significantly disputing testimony that had taken place after his prior statements, or openly disputing the president’s version of events and thereby risking the wrath of the president’s allies as well as many with whom he serves in the administration. He chose to take on the president.”

-- Trump told Sondland there was “no quid pro quo” on Sept. 9. That's the same day the whistleblower complaint was filed, after several White House staffers expressed alarm to the National Security Council’s top lawyer, after the CIA general counsel was alerted to concerns by an employee of the agency and after multiple lawmakers, including Republican senators, inquired about why the aid was being held up.

Sondland said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump emphatically said there was “no quid pro quo” only because the president had already learned about the complaint. “He was in a very bad mood,” Sondland said during his closed-door deposition last month. “It was a very quick conversation.”

-- If Sondland was an agent of Trump’s alleged plot, he portrayed himself as a reluctant one, writes the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser: “By 10:15 a.m., when Sondland finished reading out his twenty-three-page opening statement, it was all over but the shouting, of which there would be much over the next seven hours. But that was later. For nearly forty-five minutes, the impeachment hearings were compelling enough to bring the relentless Washington news cycle to a halt, at least temporarily. There was no hate-tweeting from the Oval Office, no spin in the corridors of Capitol Hill. Just people listening, watching, wondering what it would mean.”

-- Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine, amended her testimony last night. She says her staff alerted her after her first deposition that they received an inquiry from the Ukrainian embassy about the status of the military aid frozen by Trump on July 25, just hours after the president's call with Zelensky. ""The new timeline Cooper laid out threatens one of the GOP’s main defenses of Trump — that the Ukranians were not aware of the hold on security aid at the time of the call between the heads of state, and that they found nothing alarming in the presidents’ discussion,"" Felicia Sonmez, John Wagner and Colby Itkowitz report. The White House challenged Cooper’s timeline, arguing that just because the Ukrainians asked does not mean they knew that Trump had frozen the money.

Lawmakers also heard last night from David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs. Hale, the third-highest-ranking official at the State Department, shed more light on the dismissal of Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine: “‘I believe she should have been able to stay at the post and continue to do the outstanding work,’ Hale testified about Yovanovitch. Asked by Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) whether ‘what happened to her was wrong,’ Hale responded, ‘That’s right.’” Hale, who was called to testify by Republicans, also said he believed it would be unusual to withhold military aid to pressure a country to investigate a political opponent: “

-- The timeline has remained somewhat murky. Philip Bump sketched out what we know so far about it.

--The Fix prepared a list of things that Trump, Pence, Pompeo and other senior officials knew, based on Sondland’s testimony, texts and emails.

-- The FBI is seeking an interview with the whistleblower, who works for the CIA. Ellen Nakashima and Devlin Barrett report: “A special agent with the bureau’s Washington Field Office contacted one of the whistleblower’s lawyers last month, and the FBI and the legal team have traded messages since … No date for an interview has been set, and it is not clear whether one will be … The FBI is interested in the ‘substance’ of the whistleblower’s complaint, said one person familiar with the matter. … The bureau does not appear to be pursuing a leak investigation … It is unclear precisely what the FBI is investigating in its request to question the whistleblower, or whether it did so with the approval of Justice Department officials.”

-- Federal prosecutors in Manhattan issued subpoenas in recent weeks to Trump fundraisers linked to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the two indicted Giuliani associates. From the Times: “The subpoenas went to a lobbying firm run by a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump, Brian Ballard, and to two people who have helped raise money for America First Action, a super PAC created to support the president and allied candidates ... Mr. Ballard and the America First fund-raisers worked to varying extents with [Parnas and Fruman] … Prosecutors also arranged a voluntary interview in New York as soon as this week with Andrew Favorov, an executive with the Ukrainian state-owned gas company Naftogaz whom Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman tried to enlist in an effort to win business, potentially through Global Energy Producers.”

-- Parnas, an indicted Giuliani associate, helped arrange meetings and calls in Europe last year for Rep. Devin Nunes, Parnas’s attorney told The Daily Beast: “Nunes aide Derek Harvey participated in the meetings, the lawyer said, which were arranged to help Nunes’ investigative work. … The travel came as Nunes, in his role on the House Intelligence Committee, was working to investigate the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election-meddling. Parnas’ assistance to Nunes’ team has not been previously reported. A spokesperson for Nunes did not respond to requests for comment.”

-- Trump is aggressively courting some of his Republican critics – including Mitt Romney -- ahead of a likely Senate trial. From Politico: “By day's end, the president will have hosted more than 40 Republican senators at the White House since autumn began, mostly for weekly lunches that address a series of issues but also usually include a side of impeachment. ... Romney has said it would be ‘wrong and appalling’ for Trump to request foreign countries to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, prompting Trump to call Romney a ‘pompous ass.’ But the Utah Republican seemed to be keeping an open mind heading into the meeting, even if impeachment comes up. ‘It’s the president’s meeting. Whatever he wants to talk about, he can talk about,’ Romney said. ‘I wasn’t expecting an invitation, but I’m happy to hear what the president wants to talk about.’”

-- Life at the impeachment “kids table” for new committee members sometimes means waiting hours for the spotlight. Paul Kane reports: “All told, six members, four Democrats and two Republicans, are new to the panel, but only [Jordan], installed this month by GOP leaders wary of the performance by their senior committee members, has a prime seat. These are the lawmakers who have to wait, wondering whether their preferred topic will already be covered by someone with an earlier spot. That’s a normal tradition in any committee in Congress, but these stakes could not be higher, with cable news networks covering every single question late into the evening. In addition, special rules for this inquiry gave the chairman and the ranking member a combined 90 minutes of questions at the top of the hearings, leaving members of this ‘kids table’ stewing sometimes for four or five hours before getting a word in edgewise.”

-- New York Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D) will become the next chairwoman of the Oversight and Reform Committee. She succeeds the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). Mike DeBonis reports: “As the most senior member of the panel, Maloney has been serving as acting chairman since [Cummings’s death]. But she faced a challenge from Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (Va.), who argued to his colleagues that he was better equipped to handle the rigors of impeachment and battling Republicans intent on protecting the Trump administration from scrutiny. In the end, Democrats chose to respect seniority, electing Maloney on a 133-86 vote. … As the most senior member on the Oversight panel, Maloney got a boost from key sectors of the Democratic caucus that prize the seniority system — including the 53-member Congressional Black Caucus. … Also playing to Maloney’s advantage were diversity concerns: Maloney is the only woman among the three committee chairs who have taken a lead role in the impeachment inquiry.”

-- Commentary from the opinion page:

-- On the coverage: As Sondland testified, a misleading Ukraine story quickly spread among conservatives on social media. From NBC News: “The incorrect story, first disseminated by the finance blog ZeroHedge, claimed that Mykola Zlochevsky, the head of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, had been indicted over money laundering related to the Biden family. … In fact, there was no announcement of an indictment. Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, announced in October his office would conduct a wide-ranging review of all previous cases involving Burisma, and Wednesday said he was including possible embezzlement in the investigation, according to Reuters.”

-- Lawyers for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman sent a letter to Fox News asking the network to retract a “false and defamatory” segment that suggested the National Security Council’s Ukraine expert committed espionage. From CNN: “The request for a retraction centers around an October 28 segment on Laura Ingraham's prime time show, ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ During that segment, Ingraham seemed to suggest Vindman, a decorated military officer, was perhaps more loyal to Ukraine than the United States. Vindman was born in Ukraine but grew up in the US. ‘Isn't that kind of an interesting angle on this story?’ Ingraham asked her guest John Yoo, a law professor who served in President George W. Bush's administration. ‘I find that astounding,’ Yoo replied. ‘Some people might call that espionage.’ Vindman's attorney, David Pressman, characterized the segment in his letter as ‘false and defamatory’ and ‘deeply flawed and erroneous,’ noting espionage is punishable by death. ... A Fox News spokesperson pointed to Yoo's clarifications when asked for comment on Pressman's letter to the network. ‘As a guest on Fox News, John Yoo was responsible for his own sentiments and he has subsequently done interviews to clarify what he meant,’ the Fox News spokesperson said.""

THE TRUMP AGENDA THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Trump health-care adviser Seema Verma spent $3.3 million of taxpayer money to hire a stable of high-priced image consultants, who tried to get magazines like Glamour to profile her and encouraged Verma to go to social events to boost her personal brand. Amy Goldstein reports on what would almost certainly have been a massive scandal in any past administration: “Earlier this year, a top Republican communications operative delivered a plan to boost the profile of ... Trump’s top appointee overseeing health insurance for the elderly and poor. The 'Executive Visibility Proposal' was a month-by-month blueprint to have her grant interviews to Women’s Day and other magazines, speak at prominent conferences and appear at Washington’s most prestigious social events. ... This work over 19 months that provided ‘strategic communication’ services by a network of politically connected contractors and subcontractors, first reported by Politico, came as Verma spoke about the importance of fostering individual responsibility and self-reliance among the nation’s needy. As chief of [the] Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services, Verma has forged a far more partisan and outspoken brand than almost any of her predecessors. Typically, CMS administrators are visible on Capitol Hill and elsewhere but focus on the wonkish details of public insurance programs. Verma, in contrast, has emerged as one of the administration’s champions of conservative health policies …

""Offstage but irksome to some CMS staffers, the strategic communications consultants— at least two dozen of them, documents show — formed an extragovernmental team that helped guide Verma where she wanted to go politically, oversaw some decisions by communication staff and attempted to elevate her profile in ways that go beyond what federal consultants usually are hired to do — and possibly beyond what contracting law permits, according to the documents, individuals familiar with the team’s role and an expert on government ethics. ... HHS ordered an end to the contract, and work stopped the evening of April 3, after Politico first disclosed the contours of the arrangement. Afterward, Verma told multiple people that she wanted the contract restarted … HHS’s Office of Inspector General has been conducting a review of the contracts and the contractors’ role since June, and an office spokeswoman said it expects to finish early next year. ...

“The main contract was with Porter Novelli, a multinational public relations firm based in Washington. Some of the work was carried out under a subcontract to another firm, Nahigian Strategies, led by two brothers with strong GOP ties … Both of them billed at $380 an hour … At one point, CMS asked HHS to approve a multimillion-dollar contract for a national bus tour for Verma that was organized by Nahigian Strategies, but then decided not to move forward with it … Still, the Nahigian brothers and their employees continued to work as advance staff for Verma’s out-of-town appearances — a role that does not typically exist for federal officials below the level of Cabinet secretaries but was important to Verma.” Verma’s spokesman said that, of the recommended magazines and news outlets that consultants thought could write about her, only AARP and Politico did. Sounds like a not-very-good return on investment.

-- Barry Myers, the White House’s pick to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has withdrawn from consideration due to health concerns. Andrew Freedman and Jason Samenow report: “Myers’ nomination had languished in the Senate since it was first announced in November 2017, due in part to conflict of interest concerns regarding his family’s continued ownership stake in AccuWeather, the private weather forecasting company he led until stepping down on Jan. 1. … Before his nomination, Myers had served as the CEO of AccuWeather since 2007. AccuWeather has had a history of advocating for expanding the role of private forecasting companies at the expense of the taxpayer-funded National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA. Concerns had also been raised regarding AccuWeather’s record of sexual harassment lawsuits and settlements during Myers’ time at the company. … Myers’ nomination had twice been favorably reported out of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, but was never brought up for a floor vote.”

-- Fox News television personality Pete Hegseth, who convinced Trump to pardon disgraced service members charged in war crimes cases, has also been tapped by for-profit colleges to defend a lucrative loophole. From ProPublica: “Under the law, for-profit colleges can’t receive more than 90% of their revenue from federal education funds. The logic, according to the staffer who drafted the provision, was that the education should be good enough that at least some students are willing to pay. But veterans’ benefits, such as GI Bill stipends, don’t count as federal education funds (even though they also come from the federal government). This ‘90/10 loophole’ means that for every veteran enrolled, a school can admit nine more students using federal loans. Veterans advocates and congressional investigators say this loophole leads to predatory and deceptive marketing tactics that sometimes leave veterans with unexpected debt and useless degrees if schools lose their accreditation or go out of business.”

-- Trump hosted Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, the pro-Trump billioniare who sits on the company's board, for a secret dinner at the White House last month. From NBC News: “Facebook confirmed the meeting ... on Wednesday. ... It is unclear why the meeting was not made public or what Trump, Zuckerberg and Thiel discussed.”

-- So swampy: Dozens of Facebook lobbyists are tied to members of Congress, a new investigation shows. From the Guardian: “So far this year, Facebook has employed 68 federal lobbyists, 12 in-house employees and 56 from K Street firms – spending nearly $12.3m on federal lobbying through 30 September. … The Facebook lobbyists have worked for 29 current members of Congress – 18 representatives and 11 senators – including key Democratic party leaders. Four of the lobbyists have worked in the office of [Pelosi]. Two have worked in the office of Hakeem Jeffries, chair of the House Democratic Caucus. Other Facebook lobbyists have worked for the majority leader Steny Hoyer, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Mark Warner, who is vice chair of the chamber’s Democratic caucus, and [Klobuchar]. Some of these lobbyists have recently donated to their former bosses … Thirty-two Facebook lobbyists worked for Democratic members of Congress, Democratic White Houses, or were hired by Democrats to serve as committee staffers, and 30 more worked for Republicans. In contrast to the Democratic connections, no 2019 Facebook lobbyist has worked for current members of the Republican House and Senate leadership. However, several have worked for powerful GOP Senate committee chairmen.”

-- The Trump administration has secretly begun carrying out its plan to deport people seeking asylum from the U.S. to Guatemala without giving them a chance to see a lawyer first. From BuzzFeed News: “Two sources with knowledge of the process and emailed guidance sent to asylum officials ... reveal new details of the 'third country' agreement — including a crucial part of the process where asylum-seekers are not entitled to a lawyer. … [USCIS] officials emailed guidance to asylum officers across the country on Wednesday morning to notify them that implementation of the plan would begin … The first phase of the plan will take place in El Paso. Border officials will, on an expected daily basis, refer a small number of adult asylum-seekers from El Salvador and Honduras who arrived on or after Tuesday to asylum officers for interviews, according to two sources with knowledge of the process. A few dozen asylum officers who had already been trained on the process will handle the interviews. … Before this interview with an asylum officer, immigrants have no access to legal counsel — unlike their initial asylum screening, when they first arrive at the US border.”

-- Not a single refugee was resettled in the U.S. last month. From Quartz: “The nosedive is the result of a State Department freeze on admissions, according to a World Relief press release, resulting in hundreds of canceled flights and yet more uncertainty for the thousands of refugees hoping to resettle in the US. The department has issued an admissions ceiling of 18,000 for the financial year 2020—the lowest in almost 30 years, and well below the number of displaced people already in the pipeline to be resettled in the US.”

-- The Arizona activist who gave Central American migrants humanitarian aid has been acquitted on charges that he illegally harbored them. From the Guardian: The activist, Scott Warren, “was stoic after the verdict was read. His supporters were crying at the news of the decision. Warren, 37, testified that neutrality guides his work near the border and denied he has ever helped migrants hide or instructed them how to avoid authorities. … Warren was arrested in January 2018 by US agents who were staking out a humanitarian aid station in Arizona known as The Barn, where two Central American men had been staying for several days. The prosecutor Nathaniel Walters said the men didn’t need medical attention and questioned the authenticity of Warren’s claim that he was ‘orienting’ them before they left the camp. The camp is run by a group that tries to prevent immigrants from dying in the desert.”

-- Five American journalists sued the U.S. government, alleging that border authorities violated their First Amendment rights by inspecting their cameras and notebooks and questioning them about their coverage of last year’s migrant caravan. From the AP: “Mark Abramson, a photographer working for The New York Times, said two CBP officers patted him down when he returned to the U.S. at the San Diego border crossing on Jan. 5. They emptied his pockets and searched his bag, which contained notebooks with ‘confidential source material,’ the names and contact information of people he encountered while working, personal reflections and receipts to be submitted to his editor for reimbursement, the lawsuit said. After being taken to another room and patted down again, Abramson said another officer asked what was in his ‘book,’ who was leading the caravan, whether they were for or against the U.S. government and whether he knew of any groups helping the caravan.”

-- A judge blocked the scheduled executions of four death row inmates, delaying -- at least for now -- Trump's efforts to resume capital punishment in the federal system. From Politico: “The order issued Wednesday night by U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan halts four executions that U.S. officials planned to carry out starting next month. The only other execution that officials had put on the calendar, also for December, was blocked last month by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. In July, Attorney General William Barr announced plans to resume executions at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. He suggested the practice had been allowed to languish for too long and said it would deliver justice in cases involving what he called the ‘worst criminals.’”

-- Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) continue their quest for answers in the killing of Bijan Ghaisar by two U.S. Park Police officers in 2017 after the Justice Department decided last week not to charge the officers. Tom Jackman reports: “The two senators requested a briefing from FBI Director Christopher A. Wray about the case, and they also sought answers in a series of letters they have sent the FBI beginning last year, which the FBI has previously declined to provide. In addition, three members of Congress have asked the FBI to allow the release of the 911 call made at the beginning of the incident, which may shed light on why the officers repeatedly approached Ghaisar’s Jeep Grand Cherokee with guns drawn after Ghaisar left the scene of a minor fender bender in Alexandria on Nov. 17, 2017.”

-- Trump urged Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint Rep. Doug Collins (R) to fill a Senate seat left vacant by Johnny Isakson. From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “It’s the second time in two weeks that Trump directly appealed Kemp to appoint Collins, who was long considered a top contender to fill [Isakson’s seat] before a multimillionaire financial executive applied. Kelly Loeffler submitted her application hours before the Monday deadline, apparently scrambling Collins’ calculations. Loeffler, a financial executive who co-owns Atlanta’s WNBA franchise, is widely considered by GOP insiders to be Kemp’s favorite for the coveted post. When Collins was pressed ... earlier Wednesday about whether he was contemplating a bid for the office regardless of whether he’s selected, he confirmed his interest.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump said China isn’t “stepping up,"" as the trade talks show new signs of languishing. David J. Lynch reports: “Trump’s comments, made while touring an Apple supplier facility in Texas, came as investors appeared to be growing impatient with his inability to deliver the promised accord. Asked by a reporter if the deal would be completed this year, the president said: ‘I haven’t wanted to do it yet because I don’t think they’re stepping up to the level that I want.’ After nearly a year of bargaining, negotiators remain stuck on several core issues, including the extent of Chinese commitments to buy American farm products and U.S. willingness to reverse its tariff plans. … ‘We continue to talk to China. China wants to make a deal. The question is: Do I want to make a deal? Because I like what’s happening right now. We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars,’ Trump told reporters in a misleading reference to his tariffs on Chinese products, which are overwhelmingly paid by American companies. Privately, Trump is more eager to announce a finished agreement and is being counseled by his trade advisers to lower his expectations, according to a senior administration official.”

-- Hong Kong has now taken center stage in the U.S.-China showdown after Congress passed a bill intended to protect human rights on the island amid months-long protests. Simon Denyer and Tiffany Liang report: “Hong Kong’s stock market slid more than 1.5 percent, with shares across Asia and U.S. equity futures also falling, amid concerns the intensifying dispute over the city’s future could delay or derail an interim U.S.-China trade deal. … The prospect that the bill’s passage could harm U.S.-China relations and dent prospects of a trade deal appeared to undermine investor confidence. China summoned the U.S. Embassy’s acting chief, William Klein, in Beijing to express its condemnation of the bill, and vowed ‘strong countermeasures’ to defend its sovereignty. … The slide in shares eased slightly after China’s chief trade negotiator, Liu He, said he was ‘cautiously optimistic’ about reaching an interim trade deal with the United States.”

-- The Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 30 soldiers this week in the West African nation of Mali. Danielle Paquette reports: “In a statement late Wednesday, the group’s West Africa arm said it wounded another 30 soldiers while mentioning no deaths among its fighters. The Malian army, which routinely tangles with extremists in the country’s restive north, said Tuesday that 17 enemy militants were killed in the fight at Tabankort in the Gao region, which borders Burkina Faso and Niger. U.S. officials say the Sahel region, which lies south of the Sahara Desert, threatens to become a safe haven for terrorists to plot and launch attacks worldwide. Mali, which is twice the size of Texas, is a particularly troubling hot spot. … More than 100 soldiers have died in Mali since October in near-weekly clashes as the resource-strapped country tries to shake off a scourge that took root after the Libyan government collapsed in 2011.”

-- Benny Gantz, the former Israeli army chief, failed to put together a governing coalition, prolonging Israel’s political gridlock and making it likely that voters will have to vote in a third national election in less than a year. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Gantz, who has rocketed to the top tier of Israeli politics, caused a stir in October when he became the first person other than Benjamin Netanyahu to be given a chance to form a government here in a decade. Twenty-eight days later, his mandate to try is expiring with no parliamentary majority in sight. … Gantz said in a statement Wednesday that he had informed Israeli President Reuven Rivlin that it was not possible to form a government. ‘I left no stone unturned. I sifted through every grain of sand,’ Gantz said in a televised address. He accused Netanyahu, the prime minister, of negotiating not in good faith over a possible unity government but ‘with childish videos and slogans.’ For the next three weeks, the law allows any member of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, a chance to do what Gantz and Netanyahu could not: cobble together the 61 votes needed to form a government. If this, too, falls short, as most analysts predict, the country’s deja-vu nightmare will continue with another election, probably in March.”

-- Britain’s Prince Andrew is quitting his public duties “for the foreseeable future” after a chaotic interview during which he defended his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “Essentially, the Duke of York will now go dark — as sponsors of some of the 200 charities he endorses had already begun to abandon him, concluding that he no longer casts a royal glow but controversial shade. In a statement Wednesday, Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, said: ‘It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work.’ He added: ‘I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.’”

-- Six Iranian environmentalists were sentenced to prison for “collaborating” with the U.S. Erin Cunningham reports: “The defendants, part of a group of eight imprisoned environmentalists, were arrested and jailed by the elite Revolutionary Guard Corps early last year for their work tracking the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah. The trial sparked outrage among conservationists worldwide.""

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro shrugged off a government report that deforestation in the Amazon reached an 11-year high on his watch. Marina Lopes reports: “‘Deforestation and fires will never end,’ the pro-development president told reporters in Brasilia. ‘It’s cultural.’ The comments were quickly condemned by environmentalists, who fear that the Amazon is approaching a tipping point at which large swaths of the rainforest will be irrevocably lost. … The Brazilian Amazon lost 3,769 square miles of rainforest between August 2018 and July 2019, Brazil’s National Space Research Institute reported this week, an area almost 1½ times the size of Delaware. That was up 30 percent from the previous year.”

-- An increasingly popular product has sparked a bloody cartel war in Mexico: the avocado. From the Los Angeles Times: “Mexico’s multibillion-dollar avocado industry, headquartered in Michoacan state, has become a prime target for cartels, which have been seizing farms and clearing protected woodlands to plant their own groves of what locals call ‘green gold.’ More than a dozen criminal groups are battling for control of the avocado trade in and around the city of Uruapan, preying on wealthy orchard owners, the laborers who pick the fruit and the drivers who truck it north to the United States.""

-- Myanmar’s government announced that its leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, will head a legal team it will send to the International Court of Justice to contest a charge of genocide filed against the regime. From the Times: “The country’s military has been accused of carrying out mass rapes, killings and the torching of homes during a counterinsurgency campaign launched in western Myanmar in August 2017 after rebel attacks. The violence sent more than 700,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar’s population is overwhelmingly Buddhist. … The head of a U.N. fact-finding mission on Myanmar warned last month that ‘there is a serious risk of genocide recurring,’ and the mission also said in its final report in September that Myanmar should be held responsible in international legal forums for alleged genocide against the Rohingya. Myanmar has strongly denied carrying out organized human rights abuses.""

""He had to announce the investigations. He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it."" - Sondland.

A Post foreign affairs columnist argued that we still don't have enough information about Rick Perry's role in this scandal:

One of the biggest rocks not yet turned over involves Rick Perry. Sondland says he had crucial early calls with Giuliani. Holmes said he had private meetings with Ukrainians to discuss gas deals. Tried to put friends on board of state gas company. No wonder he won't talk. — Jackson Diehl (@JacksonDiehl) November 20, 2019

A Vox editor noted this troubling detail:

Arguably the scariest part of this whole scandal isn’t that Trump knew he was doing the wrong thing, but that he has so conflated his interests with the national interest, his enemies with the public’s enemies, that he believed it the right thing. — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) November 20, 2019

And a Bloomberg reporter noted this one:

Odd Point:



Trump said Oct. 2 he held up the aid because he wanted other European countries to pony up more money for Ukraine. ""I don't like being the sucker country""



He apparently never communicated this to his *Ambassador to the European Union.* — Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) November 20, 2019

The Post's fact-checker dug out email proof that contradicted a State Department defense of Pompeo:

Sondland mentioned rapper A$AP Rocky in his testimony, and no one batted an eye:

it's somewhat unsettling that ASAP Rocky has come up in the House impeachment inquiry and it didn't initially strike me as remotely odd or strange — Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) November 20, 2019

QUESTIONS DURING THE DEBATE

Two questions that emerged during the debate focus on tangentially mentioned issues.

What is a Rhodes Scholar? Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) referred to the Rhodes Scholarship during the debate, saying that he was the “other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage.” (The first was South Bend., Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.)

AD

A Rhodes Scholarship is an elite educational fellowship granted to 32 college students annually based at Oxford University. They are chosen, per the scholarship website, “not only for their outstanding scholarly achievements, but for their character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.”

What is Citizens United? Amy Klobuchar mentioned she would advocate a constitutional amendment overturning “Citizens United.” It’s a reference to a Supreme Court decision — Citizens United v. FEC — decided in 2010. In essence, the decision opened the door for corporate spending in politics, a shift that many Democrats point to as a cause of a massive influx of money that has disproportionately bolstered Republican candidates.

What religion is Pete Buttigieg? Buttigieg is Episcopalian. He talks about his religious background with some regularity and has suggested that Democrats need to do a better job reaching out to religious voters.

Not really a question, but Google did share the most common height-related questions shortly before the debate began. People are actually most interested in knowing how tall Buttigieg is. (The figures here are relative to interest in Buttigieg.)

Buttigieg is apparently 5-foot-9, according to a college student who called his campaign.

PRE-DEBATE QUESTIONS

Former vice president Joe Biden

Who is Joe Biden? Joe Biden is a former vice president of the United States, serving under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. Before that, he was a U.S. senator from the state of Delaware. He’s twice run for president before and neither time did very well — though he did essentially parlay his 2008 bid into the vice presidency.

When did Joe Biden enter the race? On April 25 of this year, later than many of his competitors.

Is Joe Biden running for president? Well, yes.

Is Joe Biden a Democrat? He is.

Where is Joe Biden from? Good question! While Biden is generally associated with Delaware, given his decades of service to that state, he and his campaign would also like to remind voters that he was actually born in Scranton, Pa., a salt-of-the-earth, blue-collar city in the northeastern part of the state. He lived there for much of elementary school.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)

Who is Cory Booker dating? Booker’s love life has long spurred interest in gossip columns. But his current romantic partner, actress Rosario Dawson, is probably the highest-profile person with whom he’s been connected.

Is Cory Booker still running for president? He is. Though his campaign has been one big rocky patch since he announced, it hit a particularly rocky patch in September when Booker made public that he needed an infusion of contributions to keep going. He got the money and got to stick around.

That he is participating in the debate is a good sign that he’s still in the race.

How old is Cory Booker? An even 50.

AD

Is Cory Booker married? Happily for Ms. Dawson, he is not.

Who is Cory Booker? New Jersey’s junior senator and the former mayor of Newark. He gained national attention in that role for both his charisma and his fight against corruption and poverty in the city.

AD

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg

Is Pete Buttigieg married? He is. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, married in 2018.

Is Pete Buttigieg gay? Happily for Chasten, he is.

How to pronounce Buttigieg? Allow Jimmy Kimmel to explain.

How old is Pete Buttigieg? He is 37. Should he win, he’d be the youngest president by nearly four years, turning 39 the day before inauguration.

Who is Pete Buttigieg? The mayor of the Indiana city of South Bend, near the University of Notre Dame. That title will change shortly, though, since Buttigieg didn’t seek reelection to his post.

AD

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii)

Who is Tulsi Gabbard? A native of American Samoa, Gabbard now serves as a representative from the slightly closer islands that constitute Hawaii.

Is Tulsi Gabbard married? She is, to a cinematographer named Abraham Williams.

AD

How old is Tulsi Gabbard? A little less than a year older than Buttigieg. Or, more directly: 38.

Is Tulsi Gabbard still in the race? Yes. Like Booker, though, she’s not polling very well.

What does Tulsi Gabbard stand for? This is a pretty broad question and one, at least in this case, that is probably better left for the debate. Or you can see our comparison of the candidates’ policy positions.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.)

Who is Kamala Harris? California’s junior senator and the state’s former attorney general. She’s a native of the San Francisco Bay area, which may explain why she’s looking for more affordable housing in Washington.

AD

How old is Kamala Harris? Harris is 55.

Is Kamala Harris still running? She is. In fact, for a few weeks, she was among the front-runners after a terribly effective exchange with Biden in the first debate. That bump soon faded, though, and Harris’s campaign is now struggling. But: She’s in the debate!

AD

Is Kamala Harris married? Yes. She’s married to Douglas Emhoff, an attorney.

What happened to Kamala Harris? She was in a dance troupe in Montreal for a while? I’m not really sure how to answer this question.

Where is Amy Klobuchar from? See above.

How is Amy Klobuchar doing in the polls? About as well as Gabbard and Booker, according to RealClearPolitics’ average of polls.

What does Amy Klobuchar stand for? The national anthem, presumably. Here, again, is our comparison of policy positions if you want slightly more detail.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

How old is Bernie Sanders? Sanders is 78. If he were elected, he’d be the oldest president inaugurated in history — and would be older than any president has been at the end of his term.

AD

How much is Bernie Sanders worth? His income topped $1 million after his 2016 run, which critics have seized upon as contradictory to his campaign focus on reducing income inequality. Most of that income was a function of the book he wrote. His net worth is slightly higher, thanks to his and his wife’s ownership of two homes.

Is Bernie Sanders a Democrat? He’s not. He’s a political independent — something that frustrates some Democrats who aren’t fans of his candidacy.

What is Bernie Sanders’s net worth? Why does this sound familiar?

Who is Bernie Sanders? A senator from the state of Vermont, though, as his accent reveals, a native of Brooklyn. In high school, he was a track star.

Businessman Tom Steyer

Who is Tom Steyer? A billionaire businessman who’s been tangentially involved in politics for several years now. In 2014 and 2016, his focus was on electing candidates focused on climate change. Since 2016, his focus has been on President Trump’s ouster.

How did Tom Steyer make his money? Finance. Specifically, hedge funds.

How old is Tom Steyer? Steyer is 62.

Where is Tom Steyer from? Like Sanders, Steyer is from New York City. Fittingly, he is from Manhattan.

How much is Tom Steyer worth? $1.6 billion, enough to give every 2016 voter $11.66.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)

How old is Elizabeth Warren? Warren is 70.

How much is Elizabeth Warren worth? Warren and her husband are worth an estimated $12 million, both from real estate and retirement accounts. (Warren may have set aside more for retirement than it seems she’s interested in using.)

Is Elizabeth Warren married? She is. Bruce Mann is a professor at Harvard, as Warren herself once was.

Who is Elizabeth Warren? A senator from Massachusetts and, interestingly, a former Republican. During the financial collapse a decade ago, Warren was a prominent voice in criticizing the failures of the banking industry, leading to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

How did Elizabeth Warren make her money? Warren did private practice legal work while also teaching and has written a number of books.

Businessman Andrew Yang

Who is Andrew Yang? An entrepreneur and attorney who is something of a wild card in the Democratic race.

Is Andrew Yang still running for president? He is. In fact, he’s polling better than a number of established politicians.

How old is Andrew Yang? Yang is 44.

Where is Andrew Yang from? He was born in Upstate New York, depending on how you define “upstate.”

How tall is Andrew Yang? It’s sort of amazing that this is the only instance in which this normally popular question was asked. People seem to have been a lot more curious about how much Democrats are worth than how tall they are.

Anyway, it’s not entirely clear how tall he is. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) says Yang is taller than he is, and Cruz is apparently 5-foot-11."

Ten candidates on stage for the debate in Atlanta on Wednesday (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

ATLANTA — The fifth Democratic debate was a study in omission, with candidates revealing their strategies and theories of victory by what they chose not to say. Moderators set the tone, focusing on fresh topics (paid family leave, America's relationship with Saudi Arabia) rather than litigating the past few weeks of arguments.

The candidates largely went along, using the briefer format (two hours with overtime, rather than three) to make their preferred case for how the party can win. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered a Medicare-for-all answer that would have silenced her critics in October; Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) made the kitchen-sink attack on Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that she whiffed four months ago. And South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had been pointedly criticized by Harris and others in the last few weeks, took only a little incoming, toward the end of the night, after the ink was drying on stories about how Buttigieg was in the clear.

Joe Biden. He's become the most consistent debater in the field, and not always in a good way. Biden always emphasizes his long experience, and the easy-to-imagine work he'd do as a new president, undoing the Trump administration's work. But for the third time, Biden's campaign previewed a strategy that the candidate himself abandoned. An attack on Warren's Medicare-for-all ""candor"" never materialized, with Biden instead arguing that his own health insurance plan would ""trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest.""

Biden also said something memorably confusing toward the end of the night, which has become a theme of these debates. Here, it began with a minor slip, saying he had been endorsed by the ""only African American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate."" He meant ""first,"" and said so after a befuddled Harris threw up her hands up. But then he went on to suggest ""one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my long-standing relationship with the black community,"" an intriguing remix of history; Barack Obama's 2008 campaign saw Biden as a running mate who could answer concerns about Obama's experience and appeal to Midwestern white voters, not fix any problems with black voters.

None of these debates has left Biden in a stronger position in early states; none has changed how Democrats see him, as the candidate most appealing to general-election swing voters.

Elizabeth Warren. She spent most of the past month answering the question that bedeviled her in October's debate: Could she be straight with voters about the costs of Medicare-for-all? Wednesday's debate gave her an answer, as her rivals had next to zero interest in re-litigating the Medicare-for-all fight and no rebuttal to her new transition plan. Warren got to deliver exactly the pitch she wanted: She'd quickly enroll millions of Americans in an expanded health insurance system with ""vision and dental and long-term care,"" then move to universal coverage ""when people have had a chance to feel it and taste it and live with it.""

Some minor verbal flubs aside (a ""billion"" when she meant ""million""), Warren executed her usual plan: Pivot to the deeper problems she wanted to fix and reject the idea that she was too left-wing. Only Warren was asked whether she'd ""use taxpayer money"" to unbuild new sections of the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border (she pivoted to attacking the ""zero tolerance"" family separation policy); only Warren was asked whether antiabortion Democrats had a place in the party. Several times, she made a specific argument for black voters (the wealth tax, for example, would help ""stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women,"" who work in child care), which was pitched to her potential audience, not debate commentators.

Warren's early success in these debates came with no fireworks, no breakthrough moments, apart from a quick put-down of former Maryland congressman John Delaney in July. Wednesday's debate was a return to the norm, with the candidate describing an agenda that could be passed with a few popular tax hikes on the rich. It worked before, and it's to be seen whether it works after a month of Medicare-for-all arguments.

Pete Buttigieg. His trajectory has been remarkably similar to Warren's in these debates — a steady rise, then one debate where the counterattacks are a little softer and more tentative than expected. That was what Warren experienced in September and what Buttigieg got Wednesday. There was just one question about his embarrassing ""Douglass Plan"" rollout, which counted endorsers who had not actually endorsed him, and Harris opted not to chase it. (""I believe that the mayor has made apologies for that."") Buttigieg's opponents mostly set him free to pitch his potential as a candidate and not bog down in his record.

""I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me,"" Buttigieg said in what could have been the most challenging round of questions. ""As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.""

The irritation other Democrats have for Buttigieg flashed only a few times, subtly (Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey noting that he had run the ""largest city"" in his state) and less subtly (Sen. Amy Klobuchar contrasting her legislative wins with Buttigieg's aspiration). Going negative is risky, and Buttigieg, last month, was the first Democrat to do it effectively. No one tried to do it better Wednesday.

Bernie Sanders. Like Buttigieg, he's sometimes ignored by opponents because they don't see him as a threat for the nomination. The tight format of a debate accentuates this; after Sanders made a historic defense of Palestinian ""dignity"" and called for ""rethinking who our allies are around the world,"" moderators moved on and asked Warren about the virtues of military service. Several times, he was left out of discussions where his bigger vision — housing policy or immigration — would have separated him from the field.

Sanders, like Warren, also benefited from the strange way Biden and Buttigieg had set up questions about ""division."" It was simple: He was for a big agenda that most Americans already wanted. ""Yeah, we've got to deal with Trump,"" Sanders said, ""but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn't just go to the people on top."" And he was not baited into an argument with Warren, whom he'd criticized over the details of her Medicare-for-all payment and transition plans. That arrangement, in the past, usually kept Sanders's support stable while Warren's increased. But that was before Biden et al began portraying Sanders as an honest candidate and Warren as not.

Kamala Harris. Harris's first answer, combining her ""criminal living in the White House"" with her plea for the ""working people who are working two or three jobs,"" set the tone: She has overlaid her ""3 a.m. agenda"" of economic issues, which was not clicking anywhere, with a personal, impassioned promise to ""prosecute"" the president like a B-movie gangster. ""He has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego,"" Harris said, bringing back the diminution of Trump that made her initially so intriguing to Democrats.

Harris's decision to finally attack Gabbard mattered for the same reason. The Californian's pitch has always been more about electability than any particular policy; her mistake in July was allowing Gabbard to go unanswered. Harris corrected that error by filling one of the most popular roles for any candidate, defending Barack Obama from his critics.

Amy Klobuchar. She benefited last month from needling Warren on whether her plans were achievable, but she was more subtle Wednesday, the reward of finally taking up some head space for primary voters. ""I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said, referring to no particular candidate. The senator from Minnesota is never going to compete for left-wing voters, not in the primary; her goal has been to paint a picture of how she would win a national election, so that nervous Democrats see an alternative to Biden.

Most Democratic primary voters are women, and in this debate, Klobuchar took and effectively used the most time to talk to them about electability. ""If you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,"" she said, a line that's been incredibly effective on the trail — a line that voters, catching dribs and drabs of election information in between impeachment news, mostly hadn't heard.

Cory Booker. The ongoing mystery of these debates is why Booker, a powerful speaker with a compelling biography and long list of endorsements, cannot break out of the low single digits. He channeled his frustration into some memorably funny lines (""I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage"") and an argument for why his personal, love-centric style could carry a national election. ""I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together,"" he said, ""but it's not for a kumbaya moment.""

In a debate with fairly little negativity, Booker did the most to set up a contrast where voters took his side: marijuana legalization. ""Marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people,"" Booker told Biden, making use of a recent clip of Biden speaking about marijuana that got little attention before the debate. ""The war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.""

That resulted in Biden's defensive riff on his endorsements from black Democrats, allowing Booker to do what he'd tried to do all year: Contrast his more immediate, modern policies with Biden's long record with black voters.

Andrew Yang. In the past few weeks, he's tried to humanize his message of universal basic income, asking voters to imagine how their lives could change with $1,000 every month. He got and took every chance to do that, especially a curveball question on fighting the rise of white supremacy. ""We have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks,"" he said, going further than the usual answer of stepped-up law enforcement.

Tulsi Gabbard. The defining moments of her campaign so far were the July attack on Harris and her weeks-long demand for an apology from Hillary Clinton, who had accused her of being ""groomed"" for a Trump-assisting third-party campaign. Both gave her an audience that overlaps hardly at all with her rivals: conservatives and independents who, like Gabbard, think the party is corrupt. Her problem Wednesday was that she got to talk about almost nothing else: A round on voting rights became an argument with Buttigieg over his ""inexperience in national security and foreign policy."" (Gabbard had jumped on a largely misreported Buttigieg point about cooperation between American and Mexican military forces.)

Tom Steyer. The first negative exchange of his campaign so far, a back-and-forth with Biden, revealed less about Steyer than about what his rivals think about him: Why is he doing this? Steyer's fundamental problems are a business-experience-not-politics pitch, which most Democratic voters don't want, and a focus on term limits as his major structural reform. Democrats don't find that compelling, either. ""Even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits,"" Steyer said, a zinger with no constituency.

Wisconsin's gold standard pollster has found tight general election trial heats in the state all year, no matter what's been happening in the Democratic primary. This is the first poll to show most of the Democratic field trailing the president. The numbers for Booker and Klobuchar, based on a sample of just half these voters, have a higher margin of error. Just a few days after Democrats held onto the Louisiana governor's mansion, they are discovering panic again, nervous about the president's resilient poll numbers with Republicans and the independents who backed him before.

2020 New York primary (Siena, 380 Democrats)

Apart from Warren's slide, the biggest movement in this poll was for uncertainty. Twenty-nine percent of Democrats had no candidate preference, up from 24 percent last month, with liberal voters becoming particularly unsettled. Sanders, who relaunched his campaign (after his heart attack) in Brooklyn, lost ground within the margin of error; the gains for middle-tier candidates seen in places where they've campaigned extensively didn't show up. New York's primary doesn't come until April, and states later on the calendar, seeing only a little candidate activity, may reflect what the many non-Bidens worry about: A national conversation about impeachment makes it tough for others to break through.

DEBATE SEASON

The sprint to December's debate in California started as soon as the lights went out in Georgia. Candidates know the rules: Getting onstage means attracting 200,000 donations and hitting 4 percent in four DNC-recognized polls or 6 percent in two polls from the early states.

After that? It's not settled yet. On Wednesday, after a DNC forum on voter protection, DNC Chairman Tom Perez told The Post that the rules will change again in January and might not include the same metrics.

“We have our rules in place for November and December, and those rules have both the grass-roots fundraising threshold and a polling threshold,” Perez said. “We haven’t set the rules for after the first of the [new] year, and that's something that we're doing right now. We always set the rules early enough so that we can give notice to the campaigns.”

Mike Bloomberg, who keeps moving toward a presidential bid, has said he will not raise money from small donors. Under current rules, that would prevent him from accessing any debate stage. But Democrats, said Perez, have yet to determine whether future debates will require small donations.

“One thing we will consider is, what should the rules of engagement be after people have started voting?” Perez said. “Because right now, zero votes have been cast. The voters haven't spoken. What should the rules be once the voters have spoken, and we have some actual data from states? That’s the question that we are considering now.”

2020

Sometime between his campaign announcement and his Medium post announcing that the campaign had ended, Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam stopped running for president. He held no events after a mid-July fun run in South Carolina; he hurriedly hired and fired campaign staff who accused him of stiffing them; he raised just $15,000 in his final quarter. (For the second consecutive quarter, he actually misreported the total and later corrected it.)

“Despite not getting the same early media exposure as other candidates were freely given and transferring millions of dollars from existing federal campaign accounts as many of the candidates did,” Messam wrote on Wednesday, “my campaign shocked many by being recognized as a credible candidate, registering in polls in early states, nearly making the first debate and polling just behind the top four candidates in my battle ground state of Florida in a recent Florida Atlantic University Poll.”

Mike Bloomberg. His long, slow journey toward a presidential campaign got longer on Thursday: He filed Mike Bloomberg 2020 Inc. with the Federal Election Commission. But, no, he’s not running yet; while Bloomberg has now filed for president in three states and federally, his political operation said that it was not a final decision.

Joe Biden. On Thursday morning in Atlanta, he met with black mayors who had written an open letter asking Democratic presidential candidates to sit and listen to their concerns.

Pete Buttigieg. He closed out his Georgia visit with a stop at a National Action Network breakfast, where he responded to some criticism of how he invoked anti-gay bigotry he’d experienced in a debate round about racial discrimination.

“What I do think is important is for each of us to reveal who we are and what motivates us, and it's important voters understand what makes me tick, what moves me and my sources of motivation in ensuring that I stand up for others,” he said.

Buttigieg was introduced by NAN President Al Sharpton, who said “cynics in the media” sometimes suggested that “homophobia in the black community is different than homophobia in America.”

Cory Booker. He’s heading back to New Hampshire for two days of events, working to capitalize on his debate performance in a state where he’s won plenty of early support from elected officials.

Elizabeth Warren. She’ll rally in Atlanta on Thursday night for the third major set-piece speech of her campaign, about the legacy of black labor movements. From there she’ll head back to New Hampshire for an organizing launch and a town hall.

Bernie Sanders. He held a post-debate rally at Atlanta’s Morehouse College, promoting a plan to make all historically black college and universities tuition-free and make billions in strategic investments. He’ll then spend the weekend in New Hampshire on a “labor appreciation tour.”

Kamala Harris. She sat for a Thursday morning interview in Atlanta with Higher Heights, a female black empowerment group that endorsed her last week; over the weekend she'll campaign in Iowa, then South Carolina.

Amy Klobuchar. She joined other Democrats at Sharpton's breakfast and will return to New Hampshire for campaign events over the weekend.

Deval Patrick. He wrapped up a whirlwind tour of early-voting states Wednesday and intended to cap it with an appearance at Atlanta's Morehouse College. The problem, per CNN's Annie Grayer: Just two people showed up for Patrick's appearance, and he hurriedly scrapped it.

WHAT I'M WATCHING

Indivisible, the grass-roots group launched to pressure the last Republican Congress to stop the Trump agenda, is holding a series of interviews with Democratic candidates for a potential endorsement. The process began with a questionnaire that only a few candidates answered and will continue on Thursday with in-person candidate interviews: Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer, from Atlanta. A central focus of the interviews will be getting candidates to commit to ""democracy reform"" in their first year as president, passing campaign finance reform, giving statehood to Washington, D.C., and breaking the Senate filibuster to do it.

“The establishment forces within the Democratic Party will focus on something like, how can we pass a reconciliation package a bit and invest in infrastructure,” said Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, shortly before the interviews began. “That will be the push. The only way this gets done is if whoever gets elected says, this is my top priority, and if you don’t do this, you will make my presidency a failure.”

By the end of 2018, there were well more than 3,000 Indivisible chapters around the country, filling a large and complicated role in the Democratic Party by mobilizing new activists, mostly women, who came off the bench after 2016.

Buttigieg and Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances?

“They’re pissed off, because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote,” Booker said Wednesday in describing the mood of black voters.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer appeared at Thursday’s gathering of African American ministers, sponsored by Sharpton’s National Action Network, alongside Booker and Buttigieg. A few minutes away, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) hosted a Black Women Power Breakfast.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), taking the stage at a rally at Morehouse College, unveiled a plan to increase funding to historically black colleges and universities. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered a speech centered on the contributions of black women throughout history.

And several of the candidates headed to Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, to take part in a phone bank organized by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, one of the party’s African American stars.

Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. Harris said it had been “misdirected” for Buttigieg, at the debate, to refer to his experience as a gay man during a discussion of racial issues; Buttigieg responded that he hadn’t been equating one experience to the other.

AD

Nina Turner, a co-chair of the Sanders campaign, took aim at Biden, playing down his service with President Barack Obama, which Biden often touts, especially to black audiences. Sanders “doesn’t believe that proximity to a black president gives one person more right to get the black vote than anybody else,” Turner said.

Buttigieg, as a 37-year-old white man in charge of a small Midwestern town, arguably faces more pressure than most to convince black voters that they can trust him. He has been gaining momentum in the Democratic race, but without African American support, his path to the nomination is challenging, if not impossible.

AD

In the most diverse field in presidential history, Buttigieg has less experience handling racial issues than many of his competitors, and he has made several missteps during the campaign. While his support has grown in Iowa and New Hampshire — where more than 90 percent of Democrats are white — he is struggling in South Carolina, with its sizable black population.

AD

A recent Quinnipiac University poll found Buttigieg receiving less than 1 percent support among likely black voters in the state.

At Sharpton’s event Thursday, Buttigieg said that as a gay man, he recognizes that his rights were expanded by the advocacy of others. That, he said, “is why I understand my obligation to do everything in my power, as a candidate and as a president, to bring about a sense of belonging and to put an end to systemic racism in this country before it puts an end to the entire American project.”

AD

Sharpton praised Buttigieg for reaching out to him on racial issues.

“He was open and candid. He called me — we didn’t call him,” Sharpton said. “I think that he has brought a very serious and thought-out vision into this campaign. Wherever it ends up, I think we will be hearing from Mayor Pete — or who knows, another title — for a long time.”

Warren, in her speech at Clark Atlanta University, one of the oldest HBCUs in the country, was joined by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), an African American lawmaker who has endorsed her. Warren was careful not to compare her experience with that of African Americans.

“As a white woman, I will never fully understand the discrimination, pain and harm that black Americans have experienced just because of the color of their skin,” Warren said. “I’m not here to tell you about a painful history that black Americans experienced and know all too well. I am here today for a different reason. I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of black history will not be lost.”

AD

The speech was disrupted several times by a group of more than 100 black activists pushing for school choice. “We value our children’s education,” said Sarah Carpenter of Memphis, a spokeswoman for the group. “If you don’t listen to us, we are going to raise our voice.”

Biden met Thursday with Democratic mayors of Southern cities, several of whom had written the candidates in September saying they needed to provide detailed plans for addressing these cities’ challenges if they hoped to get an endorsement.

Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, one of those who met with Biden, said the session went well but was just a start.

“I thought it was a good discussion, but I think a lot of us still want to have more discussions,” Stoney said. “This is hopefully the first of many talks we will be having with the vice president.”

AD

Stoney eventually plans to make an endorsement in the presidential race, and he said he would be guided heavily by how his constituents feel. For the moment, “I don’t see that sort of coalition coming together for Mayor Buttigieg,” Stoney said. “I think a lot of my constituents just don’t know him.”

AD

Biden, he said in contrast, “is a household name.”

Buttigieg is hardly the only candidate struggling to garner black support. But his rivals have begun seizing on that vulnerability to dispute Buttigieg’s suggestions that he can bridge the nation’s divides, with some questioning how electable he is without African American support.

The carefully chosen words Buttigieg uses to address those concerns have not overcome a range of problems and missteps during the campaign. In June, a white police officer in South Bend shot a black man, prompting protests against Buttigieg by black activists and forcing the mayor to leave the campaign trail for some time.

AD

AD

More recently, some black leaders in South Carolina expressed frustration when Buttigieg’s campaign listed them as endorsing his “Douglass plan” for racial justice, saying the campaign had overstated their level of support. And his campaign recently had to answer for using a stock photo of a Kenyan woman as part of its outreach to black voters.

Harris used that incident to argue during the debate that the Democratic nominee must be comfortable in diverse communities and suggested that some of her rivals were not.

“The question has to be, where you been? And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?” she said.

In a sign of their growing importance, racial issues underlined some of the debate’s sharpest exchanges. Booker, apparently referring to leaked reports of a Buttigieg campaign focus group on black voters, declared, “Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African American voters.”

AD

He added that he thought Biden must have been “high” to oppose marijuana legalization, given the effect of the drug war on minorities.

Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night.

Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — “because they know me, they know who I am.” He called himself “part of that Obama coalition.”

But Biden also mistakenly said he had been endorsed by the only African American woman ever elected to the Senate, a reference to former senator Carol Moseley Braun (D-Ill.). The second African American woman elected to the Senate — Harris — was standing a few feet away.

The Warren and Sanders campaigns have both acknowledged the need for further outreach to black communities, and they are relying on high-profile surrogates to help build credibility. Activist Phillip Agnew joined Turner, the Sanders co-chair, for a tour of HBCUs in the days leading up to the debate, and both appeared with Sanders at Morehouse on Thursday afternoon.

Turner often speaks of Sanders’s longtime involvement in the civil rights movement, and some of his supporters wear T-shirts featuring Sanders getting arrested at a protest while in college.

Birmingham, Ala., Mayor Randall Woodfin, one of those who met with Biden on Thursday, is not backing a particular candidate, but he said that Buttigieg has reached out to him and that the two might meet in Birmingham later this year.

Asked why Buttigieg has not connected with black voters, Woodfin said, “It’s not necessarily why black voters are not connecting with another candidate.” Rather, he said, “there is a candidate in the race that is appealing to black voters because there is a sense of already knowing — a relationship,” meaning Biden.

Fayetteville, N.C., Mayor Mitch Colvin, however, said there appears to be some skepticism in African American communities about Buttigieg.

“We may have to get to know him a little better,” he said."

The three other candidates who went on to win the caucus had not yet captured the lead in November, and sometimes trailed by large margins. Ted Cruz was in third place in October 2016, and John Kerry was in third in November 2004. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth in November 2011.

Of the candidates who have won the Iowa caucuses, two surged in December: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in December 2015 and former senator Rick Santorum in December 2011. If you, as I did, seemed to remember really late surges, you might be surprised that the only one matching that description was Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, who popped up in January 2004. In other words, if a candidate isn’t on the upswing now or by next month, the caucuses are unlikely to go well for them in February. At this point, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is plainly surging, as is Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), although at a much lower level.

The Register warns, “One factor that might make a late surge more difficult this cycle: The race is more stratified at this point than most. After Buttigieg comes a tight pack of [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren at 16% and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, both at 15%. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is at 6%. Everyone else is at 3% or under.”

You can point to ground organization, retail political skills and sufficient (not necessarily the most) money when handicapping the race. Another way to think of it, however, is to see the big hurdle voters would need to get over to choose a particular candidate.

For most voters, Buttigieg’s question is unanswerable at this point: Will he be able to win over African American voters in South Carolina and beyond? Voters can guess, but for contests that precede South Carolina (and Nevada, to some extent), they don’t have real evidence. He’s a work in progress with African American voters. As for Iowa voters, Buttigieg seems to be hitting a sweet spot and garnering big crowds and favorable local coverage. If we don’t see someone else break through in December, he could come in well ahead of some much better-known candidates.

For Biden, voters may want to know, Is he sharp enough? His core group of supporters hasn’t lost confidence, but he is having trouble satisfying skeptics, so his numbers are not increasing as yet. His chance for a surge is, therefore, low.

Warren’s problem is plain: Did she blow it with Medicare-for-all, veering too far left? Her implementation plan did not do much to calm nervous voters who want, more than anything, to beat President Trump. Moreover, her fierce on-message style and remarkable repetition may leave voters feeling like they saw-that-heard-that. She has been on the decline in Iowa for a few weeks. If she cannot figure out how to enliven her message and reassure voters obsessed with electability, the one-time front-runner may be disappointed with the results.

Sanders has been rising since his heart attack, but the question remains: Are there enough voters in the democratic-socialist camp for him to win? The conventional wisdom that Warren and Sanders divvy up a finite group of voters, preventing either from breaking out, may be correct in this case.

Klobuchar’s rise may be prompting Iowa voters to say to themselves, I like her, but can she really win this over all these bigger names? Voters there might well give her a first-round caucus vote to see if she can get over the 15-percent hump, and if she doesn’t, then decamp to another candidate for the second and final round. Showing these voters that she is pulling in big money and moving in polls — projecting confidence and progress — may be more critical for Klobuchar than for any other candidate.

AD

AD

There’s one more candidate who I would not count out until we get through December: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Voters may ask, Do I now understand who she is? Her ups and downs in the polls may have scared off voters who want to go with someone who can win, but along the way (judging from the Liberty and Justice dinner in Iowa and the most recent debate), she finally hit her stride, giving impassioned and confident performances that show her deep concern about some core issues. Voters who appreciate her rhetorical panache may be rooting for a general-election debate in which she pummels Trump. If I had to pick a late bloomer, along with Klobuchar, I would watch Harris.

No, the Democrats are not pining for former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick (who had to cancel a campaign event in Atlanta when almost no one showed up), nor for former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. I would like to think that Democrats are wise enough to latch onto someone like wonky moderate Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), but that doesn’t seem likely to happen.

While Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), plainly the winner of the President Trump/Bashar al-Assad primary, and Tom Steyer have zero chance of becoming the nominee, as many as half a dozen candidates are very much in the race. Put aside the polls 75 days out from the Iowa caucuses and look at the candidates with the gravitas, political skills and ground game to finish strongly in that contest. Forget the never-ending media narrative that former vice president Joe Biden is at political death’s door. Realistically, Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), any of the three female U.S. senators on the stage or South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could finish in the top few slots in Iowa. For some, that will be a moral victory (Comeback Kid Kamala Harris comes in third!); for others, it will confirm that they deserve top-tier status (Buttigieg blitzes!). From here on out, candidate quality and organization will determine the Iowa winner.

Next, let’s do away with the “Democrats have moved too far left!” narrative. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is scrambling to get back into the electability zone by modifying her Medicare-for-all plan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Buttigieg are battling for the “Midwest moderate” label, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had his best debate defending wealth creation and international leadership based on American values. The race for the sweet spot — progressive but electable — is on.

Then there is the “Biden is a goner” storyline. To be clear, he makes plenty of small gaffes (“punching” against domestic violence, boasting of his support from the “only” black woman elected to the Senate), but none has or is likely to dislodge his core base of support, especially among African American voters who know him and appreciate his loyalty to former president Barack Obama. Every once in a while, as he did on foreign policy questions, Biden reminds us that the prospect of an experienced insider sounds attractive to an electorate that has watched Trump blow up one alliance, government institution and norm after another. (“I’d go back in making sure we had the alliances we had. ... [Trump] has given North Korea everything they wanted, creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jong Un, who’s a thug — although [Kim] points out that I’m a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick.”) Biden might not win the nomination, but he has as good a chance as four or five of his rivals.

Finally, Klobuchar went a long way toward burying the notion that women are “risky.” It often feels that pundits have forgotten that a slew of women won House, Senate and governor races in 2018. Klobuchar put it well when she declared, “I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you’ve got to win. And I am the one, Mr. Vice President, that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as a lead on a ticket every time. I govern both with my head and my heart.” With a well-received joke, she concluded, “And if you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.” Four of the 10 candidates in the pared-down debate were women, who were asked a flurry of policy questions from four female moderators. Women have a permanent place at the highest levels of media and politics. To quote Mick Mulvaney, “Get over it.”

Joe Biden. Biden’s plan would create a new government insurer — a so-called “public option” — that would compete with private insurance companies in the open market. This new government insurer would give health insurance to millions of Americans and aim to drive down exorbitant costs by creating competition. This differs from a “Medicare-for-all” system in which all existing insurance systems are folded into one single-payer plan.

Biden’s plan would not be as disruptive or expensive as single-payer, but it would also leave millions of Americans without health insurance and not eliminate medical bills.

Biden’s plan would automatically enroll in the government plan the approximately 5 million Americans who live in poverty in states that did not expand Medicaid. He would also make the federal subsidies under Obamacare substantially more generous, giving middle-class tax credits to reduce their premium charges. His plan contains other changes, such as outlawing surprise medical billing, using antitrust powers to break up health-care corporations and limiting prescription drug prices.

Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg’s plan is similar to Biden’s: Both would create a new public option that competes with private insurers. Both would enhance federal tax credits under Obamacare for middle-class health-care costs. And both would leave private insurance largely untouched.

Buttigieg proposes doing more than Biden in a few small but important ways. Unlike Biden, Buttigieg is also pushing a hard cap on out-of-pocket costs for seniors in the existing Medicare system.

Perhaps the key difference between these moderates is that Buttigieg would automatically enroll people in plans on the public option if they’re eligible. He is silent on what happens to people who refuse to pay after being automatically enrolled, but says he will create a backstop fund to pay providers “for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured.”

Buttigieg’s plan, like Biden’s, is estimated to cost about $1 trillion over 10 years, far less than the $30 trillion sticker shock that comes with the liberals’ single-payer plans.

Elizabeth Warren. Rhetorically, Warren has aligned herself with Sanders’s “Medicare-for-all” proposal to establish a single-payer system. But she has proposed that America first approve a public option and not pass a single-payer system until the third year of her administration.

Warren’s public option would be substantially more aggressive than that of either Biden or Buttigieg. She would automatically enroll everyone younger than 18 into the plan and not charge them any premiums, guaranteeing free insurance to all children. It would also be free for everyone earning 200 percent of the federal poverty line (about $51,000 for a family of four). The existing Medicare program would also expand dental benefits to its existing population.

But Warren’s plan stops short, at least until year three, of pushing for a single-payer plan that would move all Americans — including the 150 million or so who get their insurance through their employer — onto the government plan.

Unlike Sanders, Warren has insisted she can pay for single-payer without raising taxes on the middle class, instead putting the burden on the wealthy and businesses. Some economists have questioned that claim.

Bernie Sanders. Sanders’ plan, the most aggressive in the race, would amount to the biggest transformation of the American health-care system in the country’s history.

Under this Medicare-for-all system, every American would be guaranteed medical, dental, vision and auditory care with virtually no deductibles, premiums or co-payments of any form. There is no apparent limit on how many times people could go to the doctor or the dentist and have the government pick up the tab."

“For too long candidates, I think, have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,” Harris said. “They show up when it’s close to election time, show up at a black church.”

She urged the party to do more to rebuild the Obama coalition.

“I completely agree,” Buttigieg said. “I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters who don’t know me.”

Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) criticized former vice president Joe Biden in blunt terms, attempting to peel away the black voters who have been the backbone of Biden’s support.

“Black voters are pissed off, and they’re worried,” Booker said. “I have a lot of respect for the vice president … But this week I heard him literally say that ‘I don’t think we should legalize marijuana.”

AD

Looking toward Biden, Booker said, “I thought you might have been high when you said it.”

AD

Biden said that marijuana should be decriminalized but that its long-term effects need to be further studied before it was fully legalized.

“I come out of the black community in terms of my support,” Biden said. “They know me.”

Biden also claimed to have the support of “the only black African American woman had ever been elected to the United States Senate.” It was an apparent reference to an endorsement from former senator Carol Moseley Braun (Ill.), but disregarded Harris — who, onstage, laughed and shrugged.

The debate came with less than three months remaining before the voting begins in Iowa, and as the field is growing both larger and more fluid. It also came after a convulsive day in Washington, with riveting testimony in Washington’s impeachment hearings extending to just before the candidates took the stage. The event began only hours after U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told the committee he believed the president used the power of the Oval Office for his own political gain.

Trump has denied wrongdoing and has disparaged several of the witnesses testifying in the probe. Five of the 10 presidential candidates who appeared on the stage are U.S. senators who may ultimately have to decide whether to convict Trump during a trial that could coincide with voting in the early nominating contests next year.

“The president felt free to break the law again and again and again,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “We have to establish the principle: No one is above the law. We have a constitutional obligation, and we need to meet it.”

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris said.

Biden chided his party for the chants that have been breaking out at some Democratic events where attendees have been shouting “Lock him up!” — a reference to Trump that echoed the line about Hillary Clinton that Trump supporters rallied around during the 2016 campaign.

“I don’t think it’s a good idea that we mock that — that we that we model ourselves after Trump and say, ‘Lock him up,’” Biden said. “Look, we have to bring this country together. Let’s start talking civilly to people and treating — you know, the next president starts tweeting … anyway,” he said, trailing off.

“Look, it’s about civility,” he continued. “And that’s not who we are. That’s not who we’ve been. That’s not who we should be. Follow the law.”

Biden said emphatically that he would not order his Justice Department to prosecute Trump, but he held out the possibility that it could do so if the attorney general he appointed thought it was warranted.

AD

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), in an aggressive debate performance, pointedly stood by her recent comments about a double standard harming the female candidates. She had said that if a woman had the same résumé as Buttigieg — mayor of a midsize city — she would likely not be on the presidential debate stage.

AD

“What I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard,” Klobuchar said. “Otherwise, we could play a game called Name Your Favorite Woman President, and which we can’t do because it has all been men.”

She later dismissively referred to him as a “local official.”

While impeachment is a unifying topic for Democrats, the presidential race has showcased the party’s internal struggle over how much of the campaign should revolve around Trump’s fate, versus maintaining the issue-heavy focus that led the party’s 2018 House candidates to a majority. Within the policy field is a separate Democratic fight, over whether to pursue the sweeping policy changes backed by its liberal wing or embrace a more-moderate vision for bringing the country together after Trump.

For the fifth debate in a row health care was a prominent topic, with the party still grappling over whether it should continue to defend the Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama or aim for a more far-reaching program that would again upend the health-care system.

It has become one of the most vigorously fought topics, with Warren and Sanders proposing a Medicare-for-all plan that would abolish private insurance and place all Americans under a government-run system.

Warren, who has released two new parts of her health plan since the last debate, spoke briefly about her new approach to ­government-run health care, which would open the Medicare program to all Americans before trying to force them. “When people have had a chance to feel it, taste it and live with it, we’re going to vote,” she said, and the country will approve, she predicted.

Sanders chimed in that he “wrote the damn bill” and stressed that he would push for a compulsory government-run health-care system in his first week in office. “The current health-care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional,” Sanders said.

But the more-moderate candidates onstage also defended their approaches. Buttigieg said that Americans would not like to be told what to do. “Commanding people” to go into Medicare, he said, “is not the right approach to unify the American people.”

Biden used skepticism of Medicare-for-all on the part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to bolster his own plan.

“Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn’t think it make sense,” he said. “We should build on Obamacare.”

AD

Pelosi’s name was cited several times during the debate, a testament to her emergence as a revered party figure.

AD

“If you think a woman can’t beat Trump,” Klobuchar said. “Nancy Pelosi does it every day.”

Buttigieg has emerged as a clear primary front-runner in some states, with a recent poll putting him ahead of the pack in first-to-vote Iowa. His opponents began sharpening their attacks on him before the debate even started, with some questioning his experience as a small-town mayor and others challenging him directly over his handling of racial issues.

Buttigieg came into the debate fresh from a controversy in which his campaign touted the backing of more than 400 South Carolinians for his “Douglass Plan for Black Americans,” even if they did not endorse Buttigieg himself. That led some signatories to feel their positions had been misrepresented.

It also emerged that Buttigieg’s campaign had used a stock photo of a woman and child in Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan; the campaign said the image has been removed from its website and apologized for its inclusion.

Buttigieg conceded that he has struggled to connect with black voters. He noted that he has not experienced discrimination because of the color of his skin, but said he felt some common cause with minorities because he is gay.

“I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,” said Buttigieg. And he said he was able to watch “my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side, shoulder to shoulder.”

Biden, when asked about being more sensitive to the cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and violence toward women, spoke of how he took advice from college students to “get men involved, engage the rest of the community.”

“We have to just change the culture, period,” Biden said. “And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it.”

Some of the most personal exchanges centered on Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and her biting criticism of the party she is running to represent.

“Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,” Gabbard said. “It’s a party that is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others, foreign policy by the military industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.”

Harris jumped in and ridiculed Gabbard for her harsh criticism of fellow Democrats, along with her ties with Trump administration officials and her willingness to meet with Syria President Bashar al-Assad.

There also were several moments of levity, with candidates displaying their sense of humor and a familiarity with one another.

“I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends,” said Klobuchar, reprising one of her standard jokes.

“I don’t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them,” Buttigieg said in a reference to Trump. “I don’t even golf.”

When billionaire Tom Steyer was pressed on his level of political spending, entrepreneur Andrew Yang jumped to his defense.

“We have a broken campaign finance system,” he said. “You can’t knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, in my opinion”

That pretty well describes the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night. It covered a much broader range of concerns than the earlier encounters, including an extensive set of queries on foreign policy. While the contenders tangled over a few issues — notably, as always, health care — they avoided fireworks, cracked the occasional joke (Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota especially) and spent far more time in vehement agreement than they did in loud disagreement.

The political upshot: While several trailing candidates, including Klobuchar and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) did well, little happened to disturb the foursome that currently leads in both national and early-state polling: former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Biden had a painfully slow response to an opening question and an embarrassing gaffe when he referred to “the only African American woman who’d ever been elected to the United States Senate” with Harris onstage nearby. But he also had some his strongest moments of the encounters so far. He was particularly quick and clear when asked by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow whether he would seek an indictment of President Trump. Biden quickly replied: “I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I’d let them make their independent judgment.”

Sanders was resolutely himself from beginning to end. Counterintuitively, in a party that loathes Trump, he opened the debate by pivoting off a question about the president declaring, “We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump” and offering a very on-brand assertion that the economic well-being of working Americans needed to be the Democrats’ highest priority.

Warren was dominant in the early going with a brisk defense of her wealth tax, which she repeatedly described as asking those earning more than $50 million just “two cents” on the dollar. She spent more time describing the programs her tax would finance, including universal child care and the cancellation of student loan debt, than on the levy itself. “We can invest in an entire generation’s future,” she said.

Warren was not left unchallenged, with Booker sounding the most conservative note in emphasizing the need to “give people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses.” But it was not until Buttigieg criticized Warren’s support for Medicare-for-all — he pushed his public-option alternative, Medicare-for-all-who-want-it — that she faded back into the group.

AD

AD

As expected, Buttigieg, who is surging in the polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire, was tested by several of those running behind. Klobuchar, who had said that a woman with Buttigieg’s qualifications would not be taken seriously as a candidate, said she considered Buttigieg qualified but that “women are held to a higher standard.” She drew appreciative laughter when she declared: “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.”

The typically well-prepared Buttigieg offered his best answer of the night in addressing his lack of appeal among African Americans. “My faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society.” And he argued that the fact that he was gay — “sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country” — created a special obligation to stand up for the rights of others.

Buttigieg probably helped himself with a tough and testy exchange across a range of issues toward the end of an encounter with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who draws particular hostility from a large share of Democratic voters.

But such fireworks were the exception, not the rule. This was the debate that sent a signal that Democrats differ far more with Trump and the Republicans than they do with each other. The question that came to mind after some of the harsh and more narrowly focused brawls earlier in the year was: How could this party possibly unite? The question that dominated on Wednesday was: Do these contenders really disagree all that much?

Of course, they do disagree, as Warren and Sanders especially wanted to make clear by way of contrast with their more moderate adversaries. But it was a salutary break from an all-Trump, all-the-time Washington to hear discourses on how to build houses, how to make college affordable and how to help families care for their kids. It offered hope that politics might, someday, be about more than the antics of a self-involved, corrupt and out-of-control chief executive.

— South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg

This is false.

In a civil complaint filed in June 2018, then-Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood of New York charged that the now-defunct Donald J. Trump Foundation had violated a federal law known as the Johnson Amendment, which bars charities from supporting candidates for office.

AD

Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign “extensively directed and coordinated the Foundation’s activities in connection with a nationally televised charity fundraiser for the Foundation in Des Moines, Iowa on January 28, 2016,” Underwood charged.

AD

The fundraiser was billed as an effort to “raise funds for veterans’ organizations,” but the Trump campaign commandeered nearly $2.8 million in donations and “dictated the manner in which the Foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants.”

The president settled the lawsuit, but did not admit liability. A New York state judge on Nov. 7 noted in a court order that “the Funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans.”

AD

As FactCheck.org reported, “donations totaling $2.825 million were given to 34 veterans organizations between January 2016 and June 2016,” such as AMVETS and the Green Beret Foundation.

“You’ve got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.”

— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

AD

The way Sanders frames this is exaggerated. His number came from a single-night survey done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to measure the number of homeless people. For a single night in January 2018, the estimate was that 553,000 people are homeless.

But the report also says that two-thirds — nearly 360,000 — were in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs; the other 195,000 were “unsheltered” — i.e., on the street, as Sanders put it. The number has been trending down over the past decade. It was 650,000 in 2007.

“I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $50 billion dollars in assets. Your first $50 billion is free and clear, but your 50 billionth and first dollar you’ve got to pitch in two cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you’ve got to pitch in a few pennies more.”

AD

— Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)

Warren’s “Ultra-Millionaire Tax” would apply to households with a net worth of $50 million or more, essentially the wealthiest 75,000 households. (She misspoke when she said $50 billion.) They would be charged 2 percent of every dollar of net worth above $50 million, unless they’re billionaires.

Households with $1 billion or more in assets would start paying 3 percent on assets above $1 billion. At least that was in Warren’s first iteration of her tax plans. She said this tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years. But to help fund her plan for universal health care, she recently announced that she would also charge another 3 percent to billionaires, for a total of 6 percent. So that’s six pennies.

AD

“By asking billionaires to pitch in 6 cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion, we can raise an additional $1 trillion in revenue,” Warren said in explaining how she would fill the $20.5 trillion hole created by her Medicare-for-all proposal. While 6 percent a year may not seem like much, it would add up to more than 50 percent over 10 years for billionaires.

AD

“Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically related issues. They come down with cancer, and that’s a reason to go bankrupt?”

— Sanders

Sanders often repeats this talking point, asserting that 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical issues. That’s approximately two-thirds of the 750,000 total bankruptcies per year.

AD

For this debate, however, the senator modified the wording of his claim. Sanders previously said 500,000 people a year go bankrupt from medical debt, but now he says “medically related issues.” This formulation more accurately reflects the study he’s quoting.

The claim is based on a study published by the American Journal of Public Health in March. The researchers surveyed debtors and asked about factors that contributed to their bankruptcies. Forty-four percent said either medical bills or loss of work related to illness “very much” contributed; 22 percent said either medical bills or illness “somewhat” contributed. Combining both groups of respondents, the study estimated 530,000 bankruptcies a year.

AD

But the study doesn’t establish that all 530,000 bankruptcies were caused by medical issues. It’s broader because it measures contributions, not causes, to bankruptcy, and includes respondents who said these contributions factored into their bankruptcy either “somewhat” or “very much.”

AD

A different study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the same question of medical bankruptcies and found that the rate was far lower: 30,000 to 50,000 a year. However, this study was limited to non-elderly people in California who were admitted to the hospital for non-birth-related reasons, so it covers only a subset of all people facing medical debt.

The research team Sanders cited once included Warren, who contributed to earlier versions of the study when she was a Harvard University professor. Interestingly, though, Warren doesn’t make the same claim about 500,000 medical bankruptcies a year.

“I have led the way on voting, and I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this and we did something about gerrymandering and we stopped the voting purges and we did something significant about making sure we don’t have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of the state right now.”

AD

— Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.)

“It was voter suppression right here in Georgia targeting African Americans that prevented governor Stacey Abrams from being in office right now.”

— Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.)

Many Democrats claim Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor’s race because of racially motivated voter suppression. Many Republicans claim that there’s no evidence for that assertion and that their candidate won fair and square. In a previous fact check, we talked to experts and took a close look at the data.

AD

Brian Kemp, Abrams’s Republican opponent who is now governor, was basically in charge of running his own election because he was Georgia’s secretary of state at the time and declined to recuse himself.

AD

Kemp oversaw an aggressive effort to purge voters, with nearly 700,000, or 10 percent, removed from the rolls in the year before the election. “For an estimated 107,000 of those people, their removal from the voter rolls was triggered not because they moved or died or went to prison, but rather because they had decided not to vote in prior elections,” according to a report by American Public Media.

But there’s a counterargument, too. Even if every provisional ballot not counted and every rejected absentee ballot had been awarded to Abrams, it would not have overcome Abrams’s 55,000-vote deficit. The 2018 turnout was far greater than any previous midterm, according to FiveThirtyEight, and more African Americans voted in 2018 than in 2016.

AD

Where you land depends on how you view the wide range of pertinent evidence. Klobuchar and Booker suggested their statements were a factual claim, not in dispute, though it’s really more of an opinion.

“With more African Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children.”

— Booker

There are several problems with this claim. First, as Booker framed it, it’s simply wrong. The 1850 Census counted 3.6 million slaves. That’s compared with African Americans constituting 2.3 million, or 34 percent, of the total 6.8 million correctional population in 2014.

A Booker spokeswoman sent us a link as evidence to a 2014 PolitiFact fact check about a different claim — that more black men are now in prison than were slaves in 1850. “There were about 1.68 million African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African American men who were enslaved in 1850,” the fact check said, rating it “true.”

But that’s not what Booker said.

Moreover, even if the black men comparison is correct in terms of raw numbers, it’s still misleading because the U.S. population has soared since 1850, as our colleagues at Wonkblog noted in 2015. The census that year found that roughly 9 in 10 of the nation’s 3.6 million blacks were enslaved. By contrast, 1 in 11 blacks is under correctional supervision today, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

“There are only two countries in the world that don’t have paid family leave for new moms: the United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list and we need to get off this list as soon as possible.”

— Businessman Andrew Yang

It may seem like a surprising statistic, but Yang is correct, according to a March report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Paid maternity leave is also guaranteed in every country except Papua New Guinea and the United States, the report said. An International Labor Organization report reached the same conclusion. At least one other report also listed Lesotho, Liberia and Swaziland as countries that also do not provide paid family leave.

“When black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America …”

— Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.)

This is correct, and Harris carefully uses the phrasing “in connection with childbirth,” as not all of the deaths occurred during childbirth. A 2018 report from nine maternal mortality review committees reported that about 700 women in the United States die each year as a result of pregnancy or pregnancy-related complications.

“Non-Hispanic black women experience maternal deaths at a rate three to four times that of non-Hispanic white women, a racial disparity that is mirrored across many maternal and infant outcomes,” the report said. “Nearly 50 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths were caused by hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions, cardiomyopathy, or infection. … Preeclampsia and eclampsia, and embolism were leading underlying causes of death among non-Hispanic black women.” The report said that more than 60 percent of the pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.

REP. TULSI GABBARD: I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels. ….

BUTTIGIEG: I know that it’s par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today’s politics.

GABBARD: Are you saying that you didn’t say that?

BUTTIGIEG: I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We’ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships for example.

— Exchange during the debate

After the two candidates tangled over Buttigieg’s comments, Gabbard said the fact-checkers would sort it out. We looked into it, and Buttigieg has decent grounds to say his remarks were taken out of context.

Here’s how Reason magazine reported his comments:

Asked if he would consider military assistance in Mexico, if the country were to request any, Buttigieg told ABC7 reporter Adrienne Alpert: “If it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure our neighbor to the South is secure."" But Buttigieg also hedged significantly, saying he’d only send troops into conflict if American lives were on the line, if there were no other choice, and if treaty obligations necessitated involvement. More importantly, he’s not suggesting anything like President Donald Trump’s tweet that he’d be happy to send U.S. forces down to Mexico to “wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.”

Reason summarized: “So the totality of Buttigieg’s comments make it pretty clear that he doesn’t actually want to send troops down to Mexico to help fight drug cartels, but he might be willing to consider some sort of security agreement to provide military assistance.”

The Sacramento Bee reported that the campaign pulled the comment back even further: “His campaign later clarified that Buttigieg would only be open to military use as a ‘last resort’ in response to Mexican cartel violence or an outside threat that endangers the country’s security.”

Nevertheless, as our colleague Nick Miroff noted, even this would be a significant step. “Buttigieg is correct that U.S.-Mexico security cooperation goes back years, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (and other U.S. agencies) have been working with Mexican military to target cartel bosses since [George W. Bush.] But a US troop deployment would be a major escalation,” he tweeted. “The question would only be relevant if Mexico wanted a US troops deployment. And Mexico doesn’t.”

Suddenly, they are asserting their influence in a presidential primary long dominated by liberal ideas and candidates one-upping each other with ever more sweeping proposals to enact fundamental changes and dramatically expand government services.

The debate here Wednesday night served as the clearest indication yet of this shift, which reflects rising concerns among party leaders and voters that Democrats risk losing to President Trump in 2020 if they embrace polarizing ideas. It also underlines former vice president Joe Biden’s inability thus far to cement his standing as the moderate standard-bearer in the race, prompting nervous Democrats to give others a closer look.

“The narrative was, ‘Look, the Democrats have been taken over by the liberals and it’s the party of AOC,’ ” said former Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), referring to liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). “I think there’s been a reaction to that, which is, ‘That’s not the Democratic Party I signed up for.’ ”

The presidential campaign’s ideological battle is far from settled, however, with staunchly liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) showing a resurgence since his Oct. 1 heart attack. His improvement has put pressure on the other leader on the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), to stand firmly behind liberal priorities as she seeks at the same time to broaden her appeal to more traditional Democrats.

But efforts by prominent Democrats to nudge the candidates toward the middle have been mounting. Recent electoral victories by centrists in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia — which built on themes that helped Democrats prevail in last year’s midterm contests — have prompted calls in the party to apply their winning formulas to the 2020 landscape.

Former president Barack Obama recently broke from his practice of saying little about the race in public when he issued blunt warnings to the candidates about the dangers of veering too far left.He is expected to reprise that theme at a party fundraiser Thursday in Silicon Valley, according to an aide.

Some moderate Democrats who initially declined to enter the race have had a change of heart. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick jumped in last week. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor and one of the world’s wealthiest people, filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a candidate. His presence has prompted outrage from Sanders and many of his supporters.

The tone of Wednesday’s debate stood in contrast to earlier showdowns that had more anti-establishment, leftward bents. Where there was once criticism from Obama’s left about the former president, Wednesday brought nothing but praise for him, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris’s calls to “rebuild the Obama coalition.” The name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who routinely has counseled a middle course, was invoked positively. The heated exchanges over highly charged issues such as gun buybacks and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings that headlined earlier debates were nowhere to be found.

Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old South Bend, Ind., mayor, has risen to the top of some recent polls in all-important Iowa as he has repositioned in the moderate lane and as an alternative to Biden. He has paired his pitch for generational change with calls for bipartisan healing in the post-Trump era.

“I’m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country,” he said Wednesday. “And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever.”

It was clear that several of Buttigieg’s rivals came prepared to elbow into the space he has crafted of late. Booker (D-N.J.), who is running on a similar platform, referred to himself as the “other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage.” (Booker also sought to present himself as a strong contrast to Warren when he critiqued her proposed wealth tax.) Klobuchar, a fellow moderate, said that while Buttigieg often says “the right words,” she has the right experience.

AD

AD

Klobuchar also challenged some of the ideas Warren and Sanders are promoting, mostnotably free tuition at public colleges and universities and a Medicare-for-all system in which the government is the sole insurer. “I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,” she said.

Warren’s maneuverings on Medicare-for-all have provided one of the clearest glimpses of the field’s broader shift toward a more moderate posture. After declaring “I’m with Bernie” in a June debate, Warren faced questions and criticisms about whether she would finance the plan on the backs of middle-class taxpayers and what it would mean for the future of private insurance.

Earlier this month, she broke from Sanders, releasing a financing plan that she said would not require a middle-class tax hike. She also added an intermediate step that would allow Americans to choose to stick with their private insurance for the first three years of her administration.

AD

AD

On Wednesday, she said her most immediate priority would be bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and protecting the Affordable Care Act that Obama passed in 2010 — decidedly moderate positions.

Advocates of expanding Obama­care instead of scrapping it in favor of Medicare-for-all, including Biden, Klobuchar and Buttigieg, have become more aggressive in defense of their plans. They have argued for them on policy and political grounds.

“I don’t think we should be trashing Obamacare,” Klobuchar said early Thursday. “That’s not what the people in Kentucky just said or the people in Virginia. They want to build on it.”

She added: “The American people are watching us right now. And this debate, if we just focus on Medicare-for-all, day after day after day, it’s not real.”

AD

On the opposite end of the spectrum is Sanders, who has vowed to push for a Medicare-for-all bill in his first week as president. The current system is “not only cruel, it is dysfunctional,” Sanders said Wednesday.

AD

Although Obama has not stated a preference in the insurance debate, he has mentioned health care, along with border security and immigration, as areas where far-reaching changes have proved to be tough sells for many Americans and which, if not handled properly, could complicate the party’s path to victory.

His views are both consistent with his presidency and reflective of broader Democratic fears about the danger of the party’s nominee being cast in the general election as far more liberal than the nation overall.

AD

“I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a bold enough proposal,” Obama said at a Democracy Alliance summit last week. “People rightly are cautious because they don’t have a lot of margin for error.”

AD

Some Democrats rejected the notion that the center of gravity in the primary is shifting toward the middle. “I think what the race is doing is deepening,” Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia and a potential vice presidential pick, told reporters in Atlanta hours before Wednesday’s debate. “We are getting more thoughtful information.”

A rise in centrist energy could have an unintended effect, some Democrats said, by crowding the lane that Biden, Buttigieg and others are competing in and splitting that vote. Such a scenario could clear a path for Sanders or Warren to consolidate support on the left and give them more establishment foes to rail against, those Democrats said.

AD

“Bloomberg is a really effective foil for Bernie and what Bernie’s stood for for years and years,” said Sanders’s pollster, Ben Tulchin.

AD

For Biden, the challenge is preventing his vote from splintering off to other candidates running on similar platforms. One major advantage he possesses is his ability to appeal to African American voters, which others, particularly Buttigieg, have struggled mightily to do so far. Several of the candidates made pitches before black voters in Atlanta on Thursday as they sought to shore up their support, a prerequisite to launching a full assault on Biden.

While Biden’s partisans denied he would cede any moderate turf, others suggested there were nonetheless upsides to the conversations dominating now."

Ashley Parker is White House reporter for the Washington Post. And Kristen Welker is NBC News White House correspondent.

We're in the middle of the fourth presidential impeachment proceedings in our nation's history. Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically.

Senator Warren, you have said already that you've seen enough to convict the president and remove him from office. You and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also U.S. senators may soon have to take that vote. Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?

AD

WARREN: Of course I will. And the obvious answer is to say, first, read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And that's what's happened with Ukraine.

AD

We have to establish the principle: no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.

But I want to add one more part based on today's testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what's happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington.

You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they're going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I've taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don't ask to be an ambassador, because I'm not going to have that happen.

I asked everyone who's running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.

MADDOW: Senator Warren, thank you.

Senator Klobuchar, you've said that you support the impeachment inquiry but you want to wait for a Senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president. After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?

AD

KLOBUCHAR: I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct and I've called for an impeachment proceeding. I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count and make a decision.

But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake. This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country's interest, and this is wrong.

AD

This is a pattern with this man. And it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day. That is what this guy does.

AD

And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that's going to put our country first. I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum. And on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect. And he said this: We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a president of the United States.

MADDOW: Senator, thank you.

Senator Sanders, I'd like to go to you. Americans are watching these impeachment hearings. At the same time, they're also focused on their more immediate, daily economic and family concerns. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?

AD

AD

SANDERS: Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election.

Right now, you've got 87 million people who have no health insurance or are underinsured. We're facing the great existential crisis of our time in terms of climate change. You've got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street and you've got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing.

What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump's corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.

AD

AD

MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, let me put the same question to you. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by the impeachment inquiry be to a Democratic nominee's campaign? How central would it be to yours?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics. And it is not a part of the campaign. But the president's conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen in the abuse of power that we're learning more about in the investigations -- but just to be clear, the president's already confessed to it on television. But that's just part of what we've seen.

Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we're also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump presidency comes to an end one way or the other.

AD

I'm running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country. And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever and, while doing it, address big issues that didn't take a vacation for the impeachment process or for the Trump presidency as a whole: a climate approaching the point of no return, the fact we've still got to act on health care, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold on to what they've got.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor.

BUTTIGIEG: Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president and will be at the heart of our campaign.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Andrea?

MITCHELL: Vice President Biden, you've suggested in your campaign that if you defeat President Trump, Republicans will start working with Democrats again. But right now, Republicans in Congress, including some of whom you've worked with for decades, are demanding investigations not only of you but also of your son. How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?

BIDEN: Well, look, the next president of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump, that's number one. And, number two, going to have to be able make be -- be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority. That's what I'll do.

You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place? And, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate?

And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned, number one, that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear. He held up aid to make sure that -- while at the same time innocent people in the Donbas are getting killed by Russian soldiers.

Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn't want me to be president. So I -- I've learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that -- that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question: Who is most likely to do what needs to be done, produce a Democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?

MITCHELL: Senator Harris, your thoughts about that?

HARRIS: Well, first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House. And there is no question that in 2020 the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot.

And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president, from what we heard today, the vice president, the secretary of state, and the chief of staff.

And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue, and back to the question that you asked earlier, which is, what does this mean for the American people?

Because what it means, when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America: the powerful people who with their arrogance think they can get away with this and then everybody else.

Because here's the thing. For those working people who are working two or three jobs, if they don't pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don't pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody. And part of the reason I'm running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people, and not just for some.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Warren, you have cast yourself as a fighter. If you were elected, though, you would be walking into an existing fight, a country that is already very divided over the Trump presidency, among other things. Do you see that divide as permanent? Or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals?

WARREN: So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks.

You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $50 billion in assets, your first $50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, you've got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you've got to pinch in a few pennies more.

Here's the thing. Doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It's about saying, you built something great in this country? Good for you. But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You did it using -- you're getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.

So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one tenth of one percent big, pitch in two cents so everybody else gets a chance to make it.

And here's the thing. That's something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about, because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and say we're going to make real change.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator. Thank you.

Senator Booker, do you agree with that strategy?

BOOKER: Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats. And I don't agree with the wealth tax, the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue.

But here's the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth, as well.

When I stood in church recently and asked folks in a black church how many people here want to be entrepreneurs, half the church raised their hands. If we as a country don't start -- if we as a party don't start talking not just about how to tax wealth, but how to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream -- because, yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour.

But the people in communities I frequent, they're not -- aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities in opportunity. And that's what our party has to be about, as well.

MITCHELL: Senator Warren, you wanted to respond?

WARREN: Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one-tenth of one percent in this country, and we can provide universal child care for every baby in this country ages zero to five. That is transformative.

We can provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women, who do this work. And we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and pre-schoolteacher in America.

We can put $800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who've got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation's future.

MITCHELL: All right. Let me let Senator Booker respond.

WARREN: Sure.

BOOKER: You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. We're all united in wanting to see universal preschool. And I'll fight for that. We're all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for two parents that went to HBCUs.

But the tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry, it's cumbersome. It's been tried by other nations. It's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation.

But, again, we as Democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it. Look at VC dollars in this country. Seventy-five percent of them go to three metropolitan areas. There is worth in the inner city. There is value in our rural areas.

If I am president of the United States, we're going to have a fair, just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but, dear God, we're going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans. We're going to see a change in what we see right now. Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

BOOKER: We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth.

MITCHELL: Senator Warren, briefly, just your last thoughts on this.

WARREN: So I just -- the idea behind what is fair, today, the 99 percent in America are on track to pay about 7.2 percent of their total wealth in taxes.

BOOKER: I'm not disagreeing with that.

WARREN: The top one-tenth of one percent that I want to say pay two cents more, they'll pay 3.2 percent in America. I'm tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it's time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets a real...

(CROSSTALK)

MITCHELL: ... Senator Booker, Senator Warren...

BOOKER: Everybody's tired of corporations getting away with paying zero taxes.

MITCHELL: Thank you.

BOOKER: I'm not disagreeing with that.

MITCHELL: Thank you very much, Senator Warren. Thank you.

Mayor Buttigieg, you have said, quote, ""I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point."" The Republican Party never stopped fighting President Obama in his eight years in office. So what would you do that President Obama didn't do to change that?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we're in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn't exist in the same way even a few years ago.

Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing, if we can galvanize, not polarize that majority. For example, on health care, the reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal health care is that that is something that as a governing strategy we can unify the American people around, creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not.

And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years, as Senator Warren has proposed, or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

Kristen Welker?

WELKER: Let's talk about Medicare for all. Senator Warren, you are running on Medicare for all. Democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care: protecting Obamacare. Democrats are divided on this issue. What do you say to voters who are worried that your position on Medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general election?

WARREN: So I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can't afford it, people who didn't take the tests the doctor recommended because they just can't afford it.

So here is my plan. Let's bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can as fast as we can. On day one as president, I will do -- bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens. That's going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people. I'm going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration.

And in the first 100 days, I want to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000. I want to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and long-term care.

And then in the third year, when people have had a chance to feel it and taste it and live with it, we're going to vote and we're going to want Medicare for all.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Sanders, let me bring you into this conversation and ask you the question...

SANDERS: Thank you. I wrote the damn bill.

(LAUGHTER)

WELKER: I want to ask you the question this way, Senator Sanders. You described your campaign, including your plans for Medicare for all, as a political revolution.

SANDERS: Yes.

WELKER: President Obama explicitly said the country is, quote, ""less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,"" end quote. Is President Obama wrong?

SANDERS: No, he's right. We don't have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current health care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional.

Now, you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we've got 87 million uninsured, underinsured. In some cases, we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada or other countries. Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically related issues. They come down with cancer, and that's a reason to go bankrupt?

Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry. But you know what? If you think back to FDR and if you think back to JFK and Harry Truman and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about health care for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time.

And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all. Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses. That's where we've got to go.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden?

BIDEN: You know, we can do this without charging people -- raising $30 trillion, $40 trillion. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all.

SANDERS: Not true.

BIDEN: It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn't think it makes sense.

We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose, I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. A hundred and sixty million people like their private insurance. And if they don't like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal in my plan. Drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board.

But here's the deal, they get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them what the insurance companies -- they want no -- no competition. And my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.

WELKER: Vice President Biden, thank you.

Ashley?

PARKER: Congresswoman Gabbard, you have criticized Hillary Clinton as the, quote, ""personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party."" What is the rot you see in the Democratic Party?

GABBARD: That our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by, and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military industrial complex, and other greedy corporate interests.

I'm running for president to be the Democratic nominee that rebuilds our Democratic Party, takes it out of their hands, and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country. A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who are calling for an end to this ongoing Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm's way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security and have cost us thousands of American lives.

These are wars that have cost us as American taxpayers trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs. As president, I will end this foreign policy, end these regime change wars, work to end this new cold war and arms race, and instead invest our hard-earned taxpayer dollars actually into serving the needs of the American people right here at home.

PARKER: Thank you, Congresswoman.

Senator Harris, any response?

HARRIS: Oh, sure.

(LAUGHTER)

I think that it's unfortunate that we have someone on this stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama...

GABBARD: That's ridiculous, Senator Harris. That's ridiculous.

HARRIS: ... who has spent full time -- who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party, when Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower, fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the Democratic Party.

What we need on the stage in November is someone who has the ability to win. And by that, we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together. I believe I am that candidate.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

Congresswoman Gabbard, I'll give you a chance to respond.

GABBARD: What Senator Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I'm seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will as president continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive.

This is personal to me because I served in Iraq. I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in the medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war. I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as commander-in-chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always -- no, I'm not going to put party interests first. I will put the interests of the American people above all else.

PARKER: Thank you, Congresswoman. I want to -- I want to briefly give Senator Harris a final second to respond.

HARRIS: I believe that what our nation needs right now is a nominee who can speak to all people. I've spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom speaking five words: Kamala Harris for the people. And it was about all the people, regardless of their race, regardless of their gender, regardless of where they lived geographically, regardless of the party with which they're registered to vote or the language their grandmother speaks.

We need someone on this debate stage in November who has the ability to unify the country and to win the election. And I believe, again, I am that candidate.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

HARRIS: Thank you.

PARKER: Mr. Steyer, you have denounced the special interests that pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process to influence it. But, in fact, you have spent over $300 million of your own money in support of your political goals. How do you respond to critics who see you as the embodiment of a special interest?

STEYER: What I've done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to take on unchecked corporate power. We have a broken government in Washington, D.C. It's been purchased by corporations. Over the last decade, with the help of the American people, we have taken on and beaten the oil companies, we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies, we have taken on and beaten utilities, we've taken on and beaten the drug companies.

I’ve also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the United States. Last year, NextGen America did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history, also, in partnership with seven national unions, knocked on 15 million doors in 2016 and 10 million in 2018.

What I've done is to try to push power down to the America people, to take power away from the corporations who've bought our government. And I'm talking now about structural reform in Washington, D.C.

Term limits. If you want bold change in the United States, you're going to have to have new and different people in charge. I'm the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits. Vice President Biden won't. Senator Sanders won't. Even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change. I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy. It's time to push the power back to the people and away from D.C.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Steyer, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, a brief response.

(CROSSTALK)

KLOBUCHAR: Well, I just -- I'm someone that doesn't come from money, and I appreciate the work of Mr. Steyer. But right now, we have a system that's not fair, and it's not just fair for money. And so I would do is start a constitutional amendment and pass it to overturn Citizens United. That's what we should do, so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics.

I have led the way on voting. And I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be to allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this, and we did something about gerrymandering, and we stopped the voting purges, and we did something significant about making sure we don't have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

KLOBUCHAR: And that's what should happen. So while I appreciate his work, I am someone that doesn't come from money. I see my husband out there. My first Senate race, I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record. I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.

(LAUGHTER)

And I'd like to point out, it is not an expanding base.

(CROSSTALK)

KLOBUCHAR: So I don't just think this with my head. I feel it in my heart.

PARKER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.

BUTTIGIEG: Since I was named, I'd like to have time...

(CROSSTALK)

PARKER: Mr. Yang, I want to bring you in. Mr. Yang -- Mr. Yang, you've made a virtue of your outsider status. You've never served in military or in government. What has prepared you to respond to a terrorist attack or a major disaster?

YANG: Well, first, I just want to stick up for Tom. We have a broken campaign finance system, but Tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change. You can't knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, my opinion.

(APPLAUSE)

STEYER: Thanks, Andrew.

YANG: No problem.

(LAUGHTER)

As commander-in-chief, I think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century. And what are those threats? Climate change, artificial intelligence, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors.

And if you look up, we're in the process of potentially losing the AI arms race to China right now, because they have more access to more data than we do, and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of AI in a way that we are not.

We are 24 years behind on technology. And I can say that with authority, because we got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995. Think about that timing. I guess they thought they'd invented everything.

The next commander-in-chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow. And that's what I will bring to the table as commander-in-chief.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

Andrea?

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Mayor Buttigieg, let's talk about your record as a candidate. You were elected mayor in a Democratic city receiving just under 11,000 votes. And in your only statewide race, you lost by 25 points. Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?

BUTTIGIEG: Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump. I get that it's not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now.

In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he's been appealing to. I don't talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don't even golf.

(LAUGHTER)

As a matter of fact, I never thought I'd be on a Forbes magazine list, but they did one of all the candidates by wealth, and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage.

I also wore the uniform of this country and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room. And I know how to bring people together to get things done. I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small. The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small.

And I believe we need to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience, the experience on the ground, solving problems, working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government, recognizing what is required of executive leadership, and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best-run communities in the heartland before the other way around starts to happen.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mayor.

Senator Klobuchar, you've said this of Mayor Buttigieg, quote, ""Of the women on the stage, do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard."" Senator, what did you mean by that?

KLOBUCHAR: First of all, I've made very clear I think that Pete is qualified to be up on this stage, and I am honored to be standing next to him. But what I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard. Otherwise, we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can't do, because it has all been men.

(APPLAUSE)

And including all vice presidents being men. And I think any working woman out there, any woman that's at home knows exactly what I mean. We have to work harder, and that's a fact.

But I want to dispel one thing, because for so long why has this been happening? I don't think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president. I don't think you have to be the skinniest person. I don't think you have the loudest voice on this stage. I don't think that means that you will be the one that should be president. I think what matters is if you're smart, if you're competent, and if you get things done.

I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you've got to win. And I am the one, Mr. Vice President, that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as a lead on a ticket every time. I govern both with my head and my heart. And if you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Mr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President, just a quick response?

BIDEN: I think a woman is qualified to be president, and there's no reason why -- if you think the woman is the most qualified person now, you should vote for them. The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is, number one, I have brought people together my entire career. In the United States Senate, I've passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to dealing with Milosevic, the whole range of things that I've been engaged in my whole career.

I've done it. I've brought people together. I'm always told by everybody around here things have changed, you can't do that anymore. If we can't -- I thought the question was initially asked of the senator, how do you unify this country? We have to unify this country. I have done it. I have done it repeatedly.

And lastly, to be commander-in-chief, there's no time for on-the-job training. I've spent more time in the Situation Room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here. I know every major world leader. They know me, and they know when I speak, if I'm the president of the United States, who we're for, who we're against, and what we'll do, and we'll keep our word.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

Ashley?

PARKER: Senator Booker, one of the defining characters of the Trump presidency is that the American people hear from him directly all the time about everything, on Twitter and just about everywhere else. Setting aside your views of his tone, is that unfiltered communication something you as president would continue? Is this one of the norms broken by President Trump that needed to change?

BOOKER: So, look, this president has broken norms, as you've said. He used his platforms to demean, degrade, and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling. But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation.

So, absolutely, in that office I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together. But it's not for a Kumbaya moment. We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together. So, absolutely.

When I was mayor of the largest city in my state -- and this is where I agree with Mayor Pete -- mayoral experience is very important. And I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage.

(APPLAUSE)

And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal. In my city, we have racial divides, we have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling. The success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldn't be done.

When I am president of the United States, my campaign from the very beginning has not changed. My charge is to see a nation right now which has so much common pain, to channel that back into a sense of common purpose. And I will do whatever it takes, bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

Rachel?

MADDOW: Chants of ""Lock Her Up"" are still heard at President Trump's rallies today. Now some opponents of the president are turning the same slogan against him. They've chanted ""Lock Him Up"" at a recent World Series game in Washington and at a Veterans Day event in New York and, Senator Sanders, at at least two of your campaign events recently. Senator, should Democrats discourage this? Or are you OK with it?

SANDERS: Well, I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law. And what the American people are saying: Nobody is above the law. And I think what the American people are also saying is, in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law.

But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together not just in opposition to Trump. The initial question I think that you wrote -- that somebody raised here was that we are a divided nation. You know what? I kind of reject that.

I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. When you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real, they know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry, they know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy sufficiency and sustainable energy.

Even on issues like guns, the American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence. So I believe, yeah, we've got to deal with Trump, but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn't just go to the people on top but to all of us.

MADDOW: Vice President Biden, let me ask you to pick up on the issue that Senator Sanders just raised about no one being above the law. When President Ford pardoned President Nixon, he said it was to heal the country. Would you support a potential criminal investigation into President Trump after he leaves office, even if you thought it might further inflame the country's divisions?

BIDEN: Look, I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I'd let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated. That's not the role of the president of the United States. It's the attorney general of the United States, not the president's attorney, private attorney.

And so I would -- whatever was determined by the attorney general I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be, in fact, criminally prosecuted, then so be it. But I would not direct it.

And I don't think it's a good idea that we mock -- that we model ourselves after Trump and say lock him up. Look, we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people and treating -- you know, the next president starts tweeting should -- anyway.

(LAUGHTER)

Look, it's just -- look, it's about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country. And that's not who we are, that's not who we've been, that's not who we should be. Follow the law, let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me ask you briefly to respond to that, the difference of opinion there with Vice President Biden.

SANDERS: Well, I think Joe is right. I think that it is the function of the attorney general. But what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he's above the law. We have a president who has engaged in corruption. We have a president who has obstructed justice and, in my view, somebody who's violated the emoluments clause.

I think Joe is right, that is the function of an independent Department of Justice. But my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.

BIDEN: Can I respond very quickly?

MADDOW: Briefly, Senator.

BIDEN: Distinction, should he be impeached and should he be thrown out of office? That's one question. He's very close to -- he's indicted himself. Number two, after he's thrown out of office or after he's defeated, should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? That's a judgment to be made by an attorney general.

MADDOW: Mr. Vice President, thank you.

Ashley?

PARKER: We now focus on an issue facing many Americans, childcare and paid family leave. Here in Georgia, the average price of infant daycare can be as much as $8,500 per child per year. That's more than instate tuition at a four-year public college in Georgia. Mr. Yang, what would you do as president to ease that financial burden?

YANG: There are only two countries in the world that don't have paid family leave for new moms, the United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list. And we need to get off this list as soon as possible.

(LAUGHTER)

I would pass paid family leave as one of the first things we do. I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs, and it's breaking families' backs. We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning, because by the time they're showing up to pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases, they're already years behind.

Studies have shown that two-thirds of our kids' educational outcomes are determined by what's happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words read to them as children, type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them.

So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1,000 a month for every American adult, which would put in many cases $2,000 a month into families' pockets, so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child. We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce. Many parents see that tradeoff and say if they leave the home and work, they're going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway. In many cases, it would be better if the parent stays home with the child.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

(APPLAUSE)

Sticking with this topic, no parent in the United States is federally guaranteed a single day of paid leave when they have a new baby. A number of you on stage tonight have plans to address this. Senator Harris, you're one of the candidates proposing legislation to guarantee up to six months of paid family leave. And Senator Klobuchar, you're one of the candidates proposing up to three months. I want to hear from both of you on this, starting with you, Senator Klobuchar. Why three months?

KLOBUCHAR: I've looked at this economically, and I want to make sure that we help people. Because as just pointed out, we are way behind the curve, our country is, when it comes to providing paid family leave and childcare. We must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big.

But what I have done with all of my plans is I have shown how I'm going to pay for them meticulously. I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the White House right now one who has told over 10,000 lies.

So when you look at my website, at amyklobuchar.com, you will see my plans and you're also going to see how I'm going to pay for it. And I think that is so important, because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino, and really putting this country in a worst financial situation every single day.

So, yes, my plan is three months. I think that's good. I'd love to do more. As I've said before, I'd love to staple free diplomas under people's chairs. I just am not going to go for things -- and this is not -- I'm talking about Senator Harris' plan here, but I'm talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here. I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.

I think that we have an obligation -- we have an obligation as a party to be, yes, fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but make sure we have people's backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for. And that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I don't support, to kicking 149 million off their health insurance -- current health insurance in four years.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you.

KLOBUCHAR: I just think we have to be smart about how we do this.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator. And, Senator Harris, why six months? And also, how would you pay for that?

HARRIS: Sure. And, everybody, please visit my website, kamalaharris.org, for the details on everything I talk about. Six months, so part of how I believe we’re going to win this election is, it is going to be because we are focused on the future, we are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow.

So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s, often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents, which requires a lot of work, from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare to all of the activities that are required, much less the health care needs that are required.

And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on. So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women's lives today.

The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, but fast forward to the year of our lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American women 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.

PARKER: Thank you.

HARRIS: So my policy is about -- there's a whole collection of the work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and, therefore, the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

Kristen?

WELKER: Mr. Steyer, millions of working Americans are finding that housing has become unaffordable, especially in metropolitan areas. It is particularly acute in your home state of California, in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Why are you the best person to fix this problem?

STEYER: When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing. Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life. It determines where your kids go to school. It determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work.

What we've seen in California is, as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units. And that affects everybody in California. It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents which affect every single working person in the state of California.

I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units.

But the other thing that's going to be true about building these units is, we're going to have to build them in a way that's sustainable, that, in fact, how we build units, where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability.

So we are going to have to direct dollars, we're going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who have worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we're going to have force it, and then we're going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50 percent of their income on rent.

WELKER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Warren, I see your hand raised.

WARREN: Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side, and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing.

Also, private developers, they've gone up to McMansions. They're not building the little two bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers.

So I've got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who are coming back from being incarcerated. It's about tenants' rights.

But there's one more piece. Housing is how we build wealth in America. The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people you're cut out of the deal. That was known as red-lining.

When I built a housing plan, it's not only a housing plan about building new units. It's a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government-sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it, and we need to say we're going to reverse it.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. Senator Booker?

(APPLAUSE)

BOOKER: I'm so grateful, again, as a mayor who was a mayor during a recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis, who started my career as a tenants' rights lawyer, these are all good points, but we're not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification and low-income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation.

And so all these things we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we've got to start empowering people. We use our tax code to move wealth up, the mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If you're a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you're paying and the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners.

And what that does is it actually slashes poverty, 10 million people out. And by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord, it is also low-income families struggling to stay in their homes.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator.

Rachel?

MADDOW: We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back with these candidates from the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate in Atlanta, Georgia. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MADDOW: Welcome back to the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate. Let's get right back into it.

American farmers are struggling under the effects of President Trump's trade war with China. The Trump administration's payments to farmers to offset those losses already have a price tag that is more than double what was spent on the Obama administration's auto bailout.

Mayor Buttigieg, would you continue those farm subsidies?

BUTTIGIEG: We shouldn't have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn't have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago, I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.

By the way, this isn't even making farmers whole. If you're in soybeans, for example, you're getting killed. And it's not just what this president has done with the trade war. In a lot of parts of the country, the worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers, which are killing those who are involved in ethanol.

Look, I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team, but more and more I'm talking to people in rural America who see that they're not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.

I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers, but we have to stand up for them, not just with direct subsidies and support, but with making sure we do something about the consolidation, the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to.

And American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change. I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country. And it's an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution, including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging they're part of the problem.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to answer the question. Would you continue those subsidies or not?

BUTTIGIEG: Yes, but we won't need them because we're going to fix the trade war.

MADDOW: Thank you, sir.

The U.N. recently reported that what was once called climate change is now a climate crisis, with drastic results already being felt. Climate is also an issue important to our audience. We received thousands of questions from our viewers, and many of them were about climate.

Calista from Minneapolis writes this. Leading the world in resolving the climate crisis will be a multi-decade project, spanning far beyond even a two-term presidency. If you are elected president, how would you ensure that there is secure leadership and bipartisan support to continue this project?

Congresswoman Gabbard?

GABBARD: This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue. This is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face. These are the kinds of conversations that we're having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents coming together, saying, hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we're able to raise our kids in a community that's safe.

It is the hyper-partisanship in Washington, unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I would bring about as president, transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry, instead investing in a green renewable energy economy that leads us into the 21st century with good-paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure, and transitioning our agriculture -- that is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face -- towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and well-being of our people, leading as a -- as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.

MADDOW: Thank you. Thank you, Congresswoman. I want to bring in Mr. Steyer on this. You've made climate change a central point of your political career. To this issue of making change -- changes that last, making changes that are permanent, could you address that, sir?

STEYER: Rachel, I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number-one priority for me. Vice President Biden won't say it. Senator Warren won't say it. It's a state of emergency, and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency.

I know that we have to do this. I've spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies, stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this.

I would make this the number-one priority of my foreign policy, as well. We can do this and create literally millions of good-paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low-income black and brown communities. And when we ask, how are we going to pull this country together, how about this: We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world, and we do it together. Do you think that would pull America together? I do.

MADDOW: Quickly, Vice President Biden, you were name-checked there. I'd like to give you a chance to respond.

BIDEN: Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It's the number-one issue. And I might add, I don't really need a kind of a lecture from -- from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that PolitiFact said was a game-changer, while I managed the $90 billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we've ever done it, my friend was introducing more coal mines and produced more coal around the world, according to the press, than all of Great Britain produces.

Now, he's -- I welcome him back into the fold here, and he's been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let's get this straight. I think it is the existential threat of all time.

(CROSSTALK)

STEYER: Can I respond to that, Rachel?

MADDOW: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You may respond, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: Look, I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and it was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels. Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels. And we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago.

If we're waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills -- and I know everybody on this stage cares about this. But Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever. This is a problem which continues to get worse. That's why I'm saying it's a state of emergency. That's why I'm saying it's priority one. If it isn't priority one, it's not going to get done.

And this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront. We have to make it the most important thing. And we can use it to rebuild and reimagine what the United States is. We can be the moral leaders of the world again, while we clean up our air and water and create millions of good-paying jobs.

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, I'm going to ask you to jump in here.

WARREN: I was also named in that.

SANDERS: Tom, you stated...

MADDOW: You were.

SANDERS: You talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency. I've introduced legislation to just do that.

Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question, because your question has said, what are we going to do in decades? We don't have decades. What the scientists are telling us, if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we're talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances.

The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come there are going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world.

What we have got to do tonight, and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable, because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet, and maybe we should think about prosecuting them, as well.

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

Andrea?

MITCHELL: President Trump has dramatically changed America's approach to our adversaries by holding summits with Kim Jong Un, getting out of the Iran nuclear deal, and at times embracing Vladimir Putin and other strongmen. So let's talk about what kind of commander-in-chief you would be.

Senator Harris, North Korea is now threatening to cancel any future summits if President Trump does not make concessions on nuclear weapons. If you were commander-in-chief, would you make concessions to Kim Jong-un in order to keep those talks going?

HARRIS: With all due deference to the fact that this is presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked. He was -- he has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander-in-chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland.

(APPLAUSE)

And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation -- and therefore, an extension of our ability to be secure -- is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.

What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.

MITCHELL: But would you make concessions to North Korea to keep talks...

HARRIS: Not at this point. There are no concessions to be made. They -- he has traded a photo-op for nothing. He has abandoned the -- by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year-and-a-half, so those operations, which should be -- and those exercises, which should be active, because they are in our best national security, the relationship that we have with Japan, he has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea's nuclear program.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

Mr. Vice President, President Trump inherited the North Korea problem from past presidents, over decades. What would a President Biden do that President Obama didn't do in eight years?

BIDEN: Well, first of all, I'd go back in making sure we had the alliances we had before since he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea. He has given North Korea everything they wanted, creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jong-un, who's a thug -- although he points out that I'm a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick, very recently was his comment.

SANDERS: But other than that, you like him.

BIDEN: Other than that, I like him.

(LAUGHTER)

And in Japan and Australia, and being a Pacific power, and putting pressure on China in order -- for them to make sure that it is a non -- it is a nuclear-free peninsula. And the way we do that is, we make clear to China, which I have done personally with -- with the president of China, and that is we're going to move up our defenses, we're going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea, and if they view that as a threat, it's an easy thing to respond to. They, in fact, can, in fact, put pressure on North Korea.

But the fact is that we're in a position where he has done this across the world. He's embraced thugs. Look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is -- his whole effort is to break up NATO, to increase his power. Look what he's done to -- and so this guy has no idea what he's doing. He has no notion how to go about it. And we need a commander-in-chief who when he stands everybody knows what he or she is talking about.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

Two more U.S. soldiers were killed today in Afghanistan tragically in America's longest war. Senator Sanders, you've long said you wanted to bring the troops back home from Afghanistan. Would you cut a deal with the Taliban to end the war, even if it means the collapse of the Afghan government that America has long supported?

SANDERS: Well, let me just say this. One of the big differences between the vice president and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it. And not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War, as well.

And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are, that we don't have to spend ten -- more than -- more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined.

But to answer your question, yeah, I think it is time after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars, which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region, it is time to bring our troops home.

But unlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at 3 o'clock in the morning. I will do it working with the international community. And if it's necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, of course we will do that. But at the end of the day, we have to rethink the entire war on terror, which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives, not only for our own men and women in the armed forces, but for people in that region, as well.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.

Ashley?

PARKER: Thank you. Mr. Yang, if you win the 2020 election, what would you say in your first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin?

(LAUGHTER)

YANG: Well, first, I'd say I'm sorry I beat your guy.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

WARREN: It's a sorry, not sorry.

YANG: Or not sorry.

(LAUGHTER)

And, second, I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression. The American people would back me on this. We know that they've found an underbelly and they've been clawing at it, and it's made it so that we can't even trust our own democracy.

The third thing I would say is that we're going to live up to our international commitments. We're going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances, including NATO. And it was James Mattis that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy, the less you have to spend on ammunition.

That has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus not just against Russia, but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on China, in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities, and what's going on in Hong Kong.

I want to propose a new world data organization, like a WTO for data, because right now, unfortunately, we're living in a world where data is the new oil and we don't have our arms around it. These are the ways that we'll actually get Russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order.

PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

(APPLAUSE)

Rachel?

MADDOW: On the issue of China, Senator Booker, China is now using force against demonstrators in Hong Kong where millions have taken to the streets advocating for democratic reforms. Many of the demonstrators are asking the United States for help. If you were president, would the U.S. help their movement, and how?

BOOKER: Well, first of all, this is president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and, in fact, attacking them, as well. We used a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. And so at the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer, and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies we would need to show strength against China.

There's a larger battle going on, on the planet Earth right now between totalitarian, dictatorial countries and free democracies. And we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government, with its leader now getting rid of even his -- getting rid of term limits.

And so I believe we need a much stronger policy, one that's not led, as President Trump seems to want to do, in a transactional way, but one that's led by American values. So, yes, we will call China out for its human rights violations.

But not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights. Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. It's a human right violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization for the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with and begin to check China, check Putin, and the other folks that are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator. Andrea?

MITCHELL: Mr. Vice President, the CIA has concluded that the leader of Saudi Arabia directed the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department also says the Saudi government is responsible for executing nonviolent offenders and for torture. President Trump has not punished senior Saudi leaders. Would you?

BIDEN: Yes, and I said it at the time. Khashoggi was, in fact, murdered and dismembered, and I believe on the order of the crown prince. And I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them, we were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. There's very little social redeeming value of the -- in the present government in Saudi Arabia.

And I would also, as pointed out, I would end -- end subsidies that we have, end the sale of material to the Saudis where they're going in and murdering children, and they're murdering innocent people. And so they have to be held accountable.

And with regard to China, we should -- look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China, what they're doing with the million Uighurs that are there, essentially in concentration camps in the west. We should be vocally, vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong. We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights.

MITCHELL: Senator Klobuchar, just to follow up, would you go against the Saudis, even though that would potentially help Iran, their adversaries?

KLOBUCHAR: We need a new foreign policy in this country, and that means renewing our relationships with our allies. It means rejoining international agreements. And it means reasserting our American values.

And so when the president did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the country that -- across the world that that was OK, and that's wrong.

And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said, first of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene, but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia and we must start negotiating, even though they were cheating, for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the New START Treaty.

And when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long term, like I do, just like the Chinese do, because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet, and they are in it for the long game.

MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: I think I may have been the first person up here to make it clear that Saudi Arabia not only murdered Khashoggi, but this is a brutal dictatorship which does everything it can to crush democracy, treats women as third-class citizens. And when we rethink our American foreign policy, what we have got to know is that Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally.

We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say we are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts.

And by the way, the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer good enough for us simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel. But we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve.

(APPLAUSE)

What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is 70 percent or 80 percent, is unsustainable. So we need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with the United Nations, and not continue to support brutal dictatorships.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator. Rachel?

MADDOW: Senator Warren, only about 1 percent of Americans serve in the United States military right now. Should that number be higher?

WARREN: Yes, I think it should be. You know, all three of my brothers served in the military. One was career military. The other two also served. I think it's an important part of who we are as Americans. And I think the notion of shared service is important.

It's how we help bring our nation together. It's how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently. It's also about how families share that sacrifice.

I remember what it was like when I was a little girl. My brother, my oldest brother, who served five-and-a-half years off and on in combat in Vietnam, what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed? How is he doing? And if there was a letter, she was brighter than the day. And if there wasn't, she would say, well, maybe tomorrow.

This is about building for our entire nation. And I believe we should do that. I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country. So, for example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in 10,000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change. We can do this as a nation.

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator. In President Trump's first two years in office, the Pentagon budget ballooned. Mayor Buttigieg, would you cut military spending? Or would you keep it on the same upward trajectory?

BUTTIGIEG: We need to re-prioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular. It's not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway growth in military spending. It's also where.

Right now, we are spending a fraction of the attention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now. If we fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building just turned into bigger targets.

We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president. After all, he's relying on 17th century security technologies, like a moat full of alligators or a big wall.

(LAUGHTER)

There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian, diplomatic, and military security work needs to take place for the future.

BOOKER: Can I respond?

MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.

WARREN: Could I respond on this?

WELKER: Coming up, we will have much more from the candidates. We're going to take a quick break, just a moment. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WELKER: Welcome back, everyone, to the fifth Democratic debate. Let's move now to the issue of race in America. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently told Congress, quote, ""The majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by white supremacist violence.""

Congresswoman Gabbard, to you. As president, would you direct the federal government to do something about this problem that it is not currently doing?

GABBARD: Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness, and attacks that unfortunately have taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It’s important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country, beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty.

This is something that I'll do as president and commander-in-chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system, working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs, end the money bail system, enact the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past.

The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, orientation, and our politics. That kind of leadership starts at the top. As president, I will usher in a 21st century White House that actually represents the interests of all Americans, first and foremost.

WELKER: Congresswoman Gabbard, thank you for that.

Mr. Yang, what would you do about the issue of white supremacist violence?

YANG: Well, first, we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the Department of Justice can properly measure it.

(APPLAUSE)

I talked to an anti-hate activist named Christian Picciolini who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10-year period. He said he was a lonely 14-year-old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade. Now he's out and he's helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society.

But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt, broken 14-year-old boy, he would have gone with them. He said if it had been a coach, I would have gone with him, if it had been a mentor or a teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.

So what we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks. And when you look at gun violence in this country, 96 percent-plus of the shooters we're talking about are young boys and young men. We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy, strong young men who do not hate, but instead feel like they have paths forward in today's economy.

WELKER: Mr. Yang, thank you for that.

Vice President Biden, the ""Me, Too"" movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take early in your administration to address this problem?

BIDEN: Yes. And by the way, it's one of the reasons -- the first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I wrote. The fact -- I didn't write the reauthorization. I wrote the original act.

The fact is that what happens now is that we, in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated. That's why as vice president -- and when I asked the president, I could start the movement on the college campuses to say it's on us. It's everyone's responsibility.

We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with -- I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30,000 people were on the call, young people between 15 and 25, and found out I said, what do you need -- what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and on your schools? You know what they said? Get men involved, engage the rest of the community.

And that's when we started this movement on the college campuses to fundamentally change the culture. No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, other than in self-defense, and that's -- rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it. It will be a big -- no, I really mean it. It's a gigantic issue. And we have to make it clear from the top, from the president on down, that we will not tolerate it. We will not tolerate this culture.

WELKER: Mr. Vice President, thank you.

Senator Harris, this week, you criticized Mayor Pete Buttigieg's outreach to African-American voters. You said, quote, ""The Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are, as the diversity of the American people,"" end quote. What exactly prompted you to say that, Senator Harris?

HARRIS: Well, I was asked a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published. But, listen, I think that it really speaks to a larger issue, and I'll speak to the larger issue. I believe that the mayor has made apologies for that.

The larger issue is that for too long I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies and have -- you know, they show up when it's, you know, close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote, but just haven't been there before.

I mean, you know, the -- there are plenty of people who applauded black women for the success of the 2018 election, applauded black women for the election of a senator from Alabama. But, you know, at some point, folks get tired of just saying, oh, you know, thank me for showing up and -- and say, well, show up for me.

Because when black women...

(APPLAUSE)

When black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America, when the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death, when black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women, who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be, where you been? And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?

(APPLAUSE)

And I'm running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks. And we've got to re-create the Obama coalition to win. And that means about women, that's people of color, that's our LGBTQ community, that's working people, that's our labor unions. But that is how we are going to win this election, and I intend to win.

WELKER: Senator Harris, thank you.

Mayor Buttigieg, your response to that.

BUTTIGIEG: My response is, I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me.

And before I share what's in my plans, let me talk about what's in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built-up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.

I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society.

And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.

WELKER: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE)

Senator Harris, quick response?

HARRIS: Look, there's a lot at stake in this election, and I've said it many times, I think justice is on the ballot in 2020. And it's about economic justice. It's about justice for children. It's about justice for our teachers. I could go on down the list.

And so the issue really is not what is the fight. The issue has to be, how are we going to win? And to win, we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because that's the last time we won.

And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities, and has the ability to bring people together. And everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and, therefore, ability to bring folks together around our commonalities, of which I believe there are many.

WELKER: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Warren, quickly?

WARREN: So I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we're willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Senator Harris rightly raised the question of economic justice.

Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now in America, African-Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they're in college, and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out, 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94 percent of them have paid off their student loan debt, 5 percent of African-Americans have paid it off.

I believe that means everyone on this stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness. It will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let's do something tangible and real to make change in this country.

WELKER: Senator Warren, thank you. Ashley?

PARKER: Senator Warren, back to you. You've said that the border wall that President Trump has proposed is, quote, ""a monument to hate and division."" Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation's southern border?

WARREN: If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border.

Trump is the one who has created this crisis, and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid. That means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity.

You know, when I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border. I went down there immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. There's like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys.

I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers, and she told me she'd given a drink to a police officer and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border.

We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect. A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Thank you, Senator.

Senator Booker, a quick response.

BOOKER: Look, I want to be quick on this because I'd like to get back to something I wasn't included in, is...

WARREN: So would we all.

BOOKER: Absolutely, if this is not effective, we see people cutting holes in this wall, his wall, the way he brags about it, it's just wrong. We need to have policies that respect dignity, keep us safe and strong.

I wanted to return back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters; I've been one since I was 18.

(LAUGHTER)

Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off, and they're worried. They're pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote. And they're worried because the Democratic Party, we don't want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that doesn't -- isn't trusted, doesn't have authentic connection.

And so that’s what’s on the ballot. And issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the vice president. He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week, I hear him literally say that I don’t think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might have been high when you said it.

(LAUGHTER)

And let me tell you, because -- because marijuana -- marijuana -- marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it's -- the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.

(APPLAUSE)

And so let me just -- let me just say this. With more African-Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children, because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people -- our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes.

(APPLAUSE)

And so these are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community. And if we don't have somebody authentically -- we lost the last election. Let me just give you this data example.

PARKER: Quickly. Quickly, please.

BOOKER: We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive diminution -- a lot of reasons, but there was a massive diminution in the African-American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers.

PARKER: Thank you, Senator Booker. Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.

BIDEN: I'll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think everyone -- anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged, be completely zeroed out.

But I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana. That's all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.

Secondly, I'm -- you know, I'm part of that Obama coalition. I come out of a black community, in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus, the only African-American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people...

HARRIS: No, that's not true.

BOOKER: That's not true.

HARRIS: The other one is here.

(LAUGHTER)

BIDEN: No, I said the first. I said the first African-American woman. The first African-American woman.

(LAUGHTER)

So my point is -- my point is that one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship, longstanding relationship with the black community. I was part of that coalition.

PARKER: Thank you. Kristen?

WELKER: And we do have to take another quick break, but we are going to hear much more from the candidates when we come right back here in Atlanta, Georgia. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MADDOW: Welcome back to the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate. Many states, including right here where we are tonight in Georgia, have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion. Right now, Roe v. Wade protects a woman's right to abortion nationwide. But if Roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states, would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back?

Senator Klobuchar?

KLOBUCHAR: Well, of course. We should codify Roe v. Wade into law. That is what we should do.

(APPLAUSE)

And this president indicated early on what he was going to do, and he's done it. When he was running for office, he literally said women should go to jail. Then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail. So no surprise that we're seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, in Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills.

And what we have to remember is that the people are with us. And I predict this will be a big election -- issue in the general election. And I just can't wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him. You know what? The people are with us. Over 70 percent of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90 percent of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the health care they need.

(APPLAUSE)

He is off the track on this, and he will hear from the women of America, and this is how we're going to win this election.

MADDOW: Just this weekend, Louisiana re-elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. He has signed one of the country's toughest laws restricting abortion. Is there room in the Democratic Party for someone like him, someone who can win in a deep red state but who does not support abortion rights?

Senator Warren?

WARREN: Look, I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party.

Understand this. When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It's just going to fall hard on poor women. It's going to fall hard on girls, women who don't even know that they're pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance.

And I know it can be a hard decision for people. But here's the thing. When it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother, she should be able to call on her partner, she should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi. But the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Senator Warren, I'm going to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question. Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana is an anti-abortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in Louisiana. Is there room for him in the Democratic Party with those politics?

WARREN: I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for. I'm not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. I'm not here to try to build fences. But I am here to say, this is what I will fight for as president of the United States. The women of America can count on that.

MADDOW: Senator Warren, thank you. Senator Sanders, I'll give you 30 seconds.

SANDERS: Let me just -- Amy mentioned that women feel strongly on it. Well, let me just tell you that if there's ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women, this is the moment.

(APPLAUSE)

And I get very tired, very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say get the government off our backs, we want small government. Well, if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians.

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you.

BOOKER: This is a voting issue.

MADDOW: Senator Booker?

BOOKER: This is a voting issue. This is a voter suppression issue. Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African-American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams right now.

(APPLAUSE)

And that is, when you have undemocratic means, when you suppress people's votes to get elected, those are the very people you're going to come after when you're in office. And this bill, opposed by over 70 percent -- the heartbeat bill here -- opposed by over 70 percent of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression. This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day, that whoever is the nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low-income and minority voters, and particularly in the black community, like we saw here in Georgia.

MADDOW: Senator Booker, thank you.

And to that point, individual states, as you all know, set their own rules for voting and for elections. Depending on where you live, you may be required to show ID or not. You might have a lot of days for early voting or fewer days or none. You might have a polling place in walking distance or you might have to drive or take a bus to the edge of town.

With that in mind, our next question comes from Jenna in Maryland, who asks, what will you do at the executive level to ensure that every American has equal access to the ballot box?

Mayor Buttigieg?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century, because this affects every other issue that we care about. Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro-democracy, anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell's hands in the United States Senate.

We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, Election Day a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote and, in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of elections before the voting even begins.

Right now, we have politicians picking out their voters, rather than the other way around. That compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.

KLOBUCHAR: I just -- I want to add this...

BUTTIGIEG: And while these process issues are not always fashionable, we must act to reform our democracy itself, including when it comes to choosing our presidency...

(CROSSTALK)

MADDOW: Senator Klobuchar...

BUTTIGIEG: ... like we do in every other election, giving it to the person who got the most votes.

KLOBUCHAR: I want to point out...

(CROSSTALK)

KLOBUCHAR: I agree with what the mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience and of leading 11 of the bills that are in that House-passed bill you just referred to.

And I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I've got to the Senate. And I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task, a bipartisan bill to say, yeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how they're paid for, and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don't have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill. And I am so close to getting it done. And the way I get it done is if I'm president.

But just like I have won statewide and mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.

MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, I'll let you respond to that.

BUTTIGIEG: So, first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?

I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces, and our marriages. And I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late.

MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Congresswoman Gabbard, on the original question of voting rights, please.

GABBARD: Thank you. I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. I've introduced legislation called the Securing Americas Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voter's voice is heard.

But I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comments about experience. Pete, you'll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander-in-chief. I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.

As commander-in-chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience, serving for seven years in Congress, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands...

MADDOW: Congresswoman, thank you.

GABBARD: ... dealing with high-level national security briefings, understanding what's necessary, the preparation that I've gotten to walk in on day one to serve as commander-in-chief.

MADDOW: Congresswoman, thank you. Mr. Mayor, I'll allow you to respond.

BUTTIGIEG: So I've got to respond to that. I know that it's par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today's politics.

GABBARD: Are you saying that you didn't say that?

BUTTIGIEG: I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We've been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?

(LAUGHTER)

GABBARD: That's not what I said. That's not what I said.

BUTTIGIEG: I'm talking about building up -- I'm talking about building up alliances. And if your question is about experience, let's also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad. I have in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not since it wasn't accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Congresswoman Gabbard, let me allow you to respond.

GABBARD: Thank you. You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes. The fact-checkers can check this out.

BUTTIGIEG: No.

GABBARD: But your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander-in-chief does need to have good judgment. And what you've just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.

BUTTIGIEG: Like Donald Trump who met with Kim.

GABBARD: Like Reagan, who met -- like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev. These issues of national security are incredibly important. I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm's way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security. I'll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Congresswoman Gabbard...

BUTTIGIEG: I've got to respond to this. This is a direct...

(CROSSTALK)

MADDOW: Senator Sanders, I'm going to have you respond.

SANDERS: To your original point, the American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt. And it is not just voter suppression, which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying black people and people of color the right to vote, but we also have a system through Citizens United which allows billionaires to buy elections.

So what we need to do, simple and straightforward, in every state in this country through the federal government, if you are 18, you have a right to vote, end of discussion.

(APPLAUSE)

We have to overturn Citizens United. We need to move toward public funding of elections.

MADDOW: On this last point, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: I agree exactly with what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how we're going to win in 2020. I don't mean to change the subject, but I think it's sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020 but have a sweeping victory across the country. And what that's going to mean is turnout.

In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don't vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth, no one deals with my issues, the system is broken, why would we vote?

But what we've found at NextGen America is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. And if you look at 2018 and flipping the House, what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three-quarters. In the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people, the turnout went up by more than 100 percent, more than double.

MADDOW: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: So for us to win, for everybody on this stage, for whoever's the candidate, to have a Senate that's Democratic, for us to have the sweeping victory that we absolutely...

MADDOW: Mr. Steyer, thank you.

STEYER: ... are going to have next year, it's a turnout question. We're going to have to tell the truth and we're going to have organize across this country.

MADDOW: Thank you very much.

SANDERS: Exactly right. That's exactly right.

MADDOW: It is time -- at this point, it is well past time, if I'm honest, to start closing statements. And we are going to start tonight with Senator Booker. The floor is yours.

BOOKER: Thank you, Rachel. It's an honor to be here tonight.

I have not yet qualified for the December stage and need your help to do that. If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to corybooker.com. Please help.

I had a closing statement prepared, but I saw in the audience during the break a man named John Lewis. And perhaps it's interesting and important for me to mention why I'm so grateful to him.

I've been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way, by bringing people together to create transformative change, not just beat Donald Trump. That's the floor. We need to go to the ceiling. We need to go to the mountaintop.

I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago there was a lawyer on a couch who changed his life, changed his mind to get up and start representing families, one of them mine, who were discriminated against. The house I grew up in is because of that lawyer's activity.

When I asked him why, why he did what he did, he told me that on March 7, 1965, he was watching a movie called ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" on TV and they interrupted that movie to show a bridge in Alabama called the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And there he saw John Lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by Alabama state troopers.

We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again, that we have truly a moral moment in America, like it was back in 1965.

If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble. I will challenge us. I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before, because we...

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.

BOOKER: ... need to mobilize a new American movement. Keep me on this stage. Keep me on this race. It is time we fight and fight together. Please go to corybooker.com.

MADDOW: Senator Booker, thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Mr. Steyer, your closing statement.

STEYER: Last time I was on this stage, I started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the White House. And I stand by that statement.

But I'm different from everybody else on this stage. I know that the government in Washington, D.C., is broken. I know that it's been purchased by corporations. And I've spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations.

I'm the only one on this stage who's willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself, term limits, that if we're going to make bold changes, we're going to need new and different people in charge. I'm the only person on this stage who spent decades building an international business. Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr. Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy, talk about growth, understand that we can make Mr. Trump what he is, a fraud and a failure, on the economy, which is his strong point.

I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority, that it's our biggest challenge, but it's our biggest opportunity to recreate this country.

If you want to beat Mr. Trump, if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government, if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants, I'm the person who can do it.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: I have spent a decade trusting the American people...

(LAUGHTER)

MITCHELL: Thank -- thank -- thank you, Mr. Steyer.

STEYER: I'm asking you to trust me.

MITCHELL: Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Congresswoman Gabbard, go ahead.

GABBARD: My personal commitment to you, to all of my fellow Americans, is to treat you with respect and compassion, something that we in Hawaii called aloha. Every single person deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of race, religion, or gender, or even your politics. Inclusion, unity, respect, aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration.

Now, Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959, where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the aloha spirit. He said we look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice, where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country. He later went on to say, as I looked out at the various faces and various colors mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.

Working side by side, let's defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump, come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace, inclusion, and true equality, working side by side. Let's make Dr. King's dream our reality.

PARKER: Thank you, Congresswoman.

WELKER: Mr. Yang, your turn.

YANG: I'm here with my wife, Evelyn, tonight. We have two young boys, Christopher and Damian. How many of you all are parents like us here in the room?

So if you're a parent, you've had this thought. Maybe you've been afraid to express it. And it is this: Our kids are not all right. They're not all right because we're leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents.

We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history, the fourth industrial revolution, and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side. We talk as if Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems. He is not. He is a symptom. And we need to cure the disease.

Now, my first move was not to run for president of the United States, because I am not insane.

(LAUGHTER)

My first move was to go to D.C., talk to our leaders and say technology is ripping us apart, immigrants are being scapegoated, our kids are being left behind, and the American dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes. And the people in Washington, D.C., had nothing for this. They don't want to touch it. They don't want to talk about an issue they don't think they have a solution for.

I'm not running for president because I fantasized about being president. I'm running for president because, like many of you here in this room tonight, I'm a parent and a patriot and I have seen the future that we're leaving for our kids, and it is not something I'm willing to accept.

We need to create a new way forward for our people. If you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy, go to yang2020.com and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them, and believe it: Your country loves you, your country values you, and you will be all right.

WELKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.

MADDOW: Senator Klobuchar?

KLOBUCHAR: The nation was riveted this week by the testimony in Washington. One of the people we heard from yesterday was Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. And what he said was -- as he spoke to his immigrant father and he said, in this country, you can tell the truth and it's going to be fine. It reminded me of Army counsel years and years ago in the McCarthy hearing, someone from Iowa, actually, Mr. Welch, who said, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir?""

I want us to remember that this election is, yes, an economic check on this president, and I have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of health care, yes.

But this is also a patriotism check, a value check, a decency check. And when you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didn't vote in 2016, African-Americans are turning out like we didn't see before. But we also -- and they must be with us, and we must get our fired-up Democratic base with us.

But we also, let's get those independents and moderate Republicans who cannot stomach this guy anymore. This is how we build a coalition, so we don't just beat Donald Trump. We bring the U.S. Senate to some sense. We send Mitch McConnell packing. This is how we win.

So if you want to join us -- and remember that this won't be for me a personal victory, it will be a national victory, of someone that wins in red districts and suburban, purple districts, and bright blue districts every single time. If you want to join us and if you believe that our work doesn't end on Election Day, but begins on Inauguration Day, join us, amyklobuchar.com.

MADDOW: Senator Klobuchar, thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Senator Harris?

HARRIS: So, we're in a fight. This is a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. And it's a fight we need to win.

And to fight this fight, I believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe to toe with Donald Trump -- and I have taken on Jeff Sessions, I've taken on Bill Barr, I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh. I know I have the ability to do that.

We also need someone who can unify the party and the country and who has the experience of having done that. I've done that work. I believe we need someone who has the ability to speak to all the people regardless of their race, their gender, their party affiliation, where they live geographically or the language their grandmother speaks.

My entire career has been spent having one client and one client only: the people. I have never represented a corporation. I've never represented a special interest. And in this election, justice and the various injustices people are facing regardless of where they live or their race or gender are very much on the ballot, from economic justice to reproductive justice to health care justice to educational justice.

And I truly believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will then unlock the potential of the American people and the promise of America, and that's the America I believe in. That's the America I see. And that is why I'm running for president.

MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator Harris.

(APPLAUSE)

PARKER: Mayor Buttigieg, go ahead.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, I want to remark that we're in the city of Atlanta, a city where a great local leader, Maynard Jackson, helped create the black middle class that Atlanta is known by, by ensuring that taxpayer dollars were spent in a way that reflected the need to expand opportunity to those who were excluded.

And just as local leaders have shown great leadership, we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this, expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country.

I'm not only running to defeat Donald Trump. I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office, to launch the era that must come after Trump. That era must be characterized not by exclusion, but by belonging. And so must our campaign.

I am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues we've been talking about tonight all along, moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition, and a lot of future former Republicans, who I know are watching this, disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country. I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create.

I hope you go to peteforamerica.com, join this effort, and help us create a better era for the American people beginning in November 2020.

PARKER: Thank you.

WELKER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: Thank you. Let me say a word about myself, unusual as it may seem.

(LAUGHTER)

I am the son of an immigrant, young man of 17 who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. I have some sense of the immigrant experience. I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.

At the age of 21, as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago, I was arrested, spent the night in jail, and I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination -- racial discrimination, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and religious bigotry. I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness brought by Trump, and bring us together.

During this campaign, I am proud to say that I have received more campaign contributions than any candidate at this point in an election in American history, over 4 million contributions, averaging $18 apiece.

(APPLAUSE)

If you want to be part of a movement that is not only going to beat Trump, but transform America, that doesn’t have a super PAC, doesn’t do fundraisers at wealthy people’s homes, please join us at berniesanders.com. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: Senator Warren, the floor is yours.

WARREN: So, thank you. You know, I've listened to this debate tonight and I hear a lot of really good ideas. But I take a look at the issues we've talked about. We've talked about climate change. We've talked about defense spending. We've talked about private health insurance. We should have talked about gun violence.

What do these issues have in common? Well, first, they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. And what is the second thing they have in common? We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it, and the majority of Americans are with us on it, and yet we don't make change. Why not?

Because of corruption. Because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription. It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms instead of into our public schools. We have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else.

I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. It involves ending lobbying as we know it, blocking the revolving door between industry and Washington, making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online.

(APPLAUSE)

We have to have the courage not to make just individual changes, not to fight for little pieces. We want to make real progress on climate. Then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country.

I am so grateful to be here and I am grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a chance to become a college professor, a chance to become a United States senator...

MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.

WARREN: ... and a chance to become candidate for president of the United States. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

MITCHELL: Vice President Biden, your closing statement.

BIDEN: I assume we're only talking about the corruption of the federal government. We weren't talking about Barack Obama and his spotless administration who made so much progress.

But one thing we haven't talked about here today, we haven't talked -- we talked about everything, but we haven't talked about the one thing I think is most consequential.

You know, the American people have an enormous opportunity. There's an incredible -- incredible -- I've never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career, and I got elected when I was a 29-year-old kid to the United States Senate.

Folks, we are in a position where we have -- we're the wealthiest nation in the world, our workers are more productive than workers around the world, three times as productive as workers in Asia. We have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined. We're in a position where we've led not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.

I'm so tired of everybody walking around like woe is me, what are we going to do? Let's remember, this is the United States of America. There has never, ever, ever been a time when we have set our mind to do something we've been unable to do it. Never. Never, never.

So it's time to remember, get up, let's take back this country and lead the world again. It's within our power to do it. Get up and take it back.

(APPLAUSE)

THE KEY

A frontal assault on claims by President Trump and Republicans that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election was welcome news to security researchers.

Fiona Hill, a former member of Trump's National Security Council, insisted in yesterday's impeachment hearing that such allegations not only undermine U.S. intelligence agencies' universal conclusion that Russia was responsible but play right into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,” Hill said. “This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”

This was a memorable clapback after a week of careful testimony by diplomats and a slew of conspiracy theories elevated by Republicans on the committee.

“It’s going to be incredibly difficult to prepare for 2020, or to deter activity in 2020, if we’re not clear about what happened in 2016,” John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, told me.

“[Russian interference] was agreed to by just about every intelligence agency and cybersecurity company out there. Any alternative story that hasn’t been vetted by serious organizations just muddies the waters.”

Hill also suggested that lawmakers' statements might make it easier for the Kremlin to strike again. “Right now, Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We are running out of time to stop them,” she said. “In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically derivative falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.”

In fact, as my colleague Philip Bump points out, ""we don’t need to take Hill’s word for it that Russia embraces the Ukraine-did-it-too narrative being deployed by Trump’s allies. [Putin] spoke at an event in Moscow on Wednesday and addressed the idea directly.""

“Thank God,” Putin said, “no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore. Now they’re accusing Ukraine.”

Hill's language was designed to send a message to politicians about the damage they were doing to the country. “These fictions are harmful, even if they're deployed for purely domestic political purposes,” she said. “President Putin and the Russian security services operate like a super PAC. They deploy millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives. When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each other, degrade our institutions and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy.”

Her comments drew cheers from Democratic lawmakers.

From House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.):

This morning, Fiona Hill, an expert on Russian & Eurasian affairs, will testify & dispel the GOP’s false claims that Ukraine – not Russia – interfered in our election. The GOP must stop peddling conspiracy theories as a way to blindly defend POTUS & #DefendOurDemocray. https://t.co/wDdam3HWVt — Steny Hoyer (@LeaderHoyer) November 21, 2019

From 2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.):

MUST WATCH: This morning, Dr. Fiona Hill reaffirmed what our Intelligence Community has been telling us for years: it was Russia—not Ukraine—that interfered in the 2016 election.



Russia threatened the very heart of our democracy. Republicans must stop distorting the truth. https://t.co/uqM9qILpLM — Kamala Harris (@SenKamalaHarris) November 21, 2019

Republicans shot back, however, saying Hill was misstating their arguments because they haven’t explicitly denied Russia interfered in 2016.

“My Democratic colleagues attempting to manipulate media coverage with untruthful statements about our efforts to combat Russian interference reeks of political desperation. Not one Republican on the Committee has denied Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 election,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) tweeted.

The top Republican on the commitee, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who suggested specifically this week that Ukraine acted inappropriately in the 2016 election, said Republicans were only arguing that perhaps another country did, too. (As my colleague Aaron Blake points out, ""Trump, it bears noting, has suggested it was really only Ukraine."")

Addressing Hill's criticisms, Nunes said, ""it is entirely possible for two separate nations to engage in election meddling at the same time. And Republicans believe we should take meddling seriously by all foreign countries, regardless of which campaign is the target.”

""Later in the hearing, though, Hill offered an extensive response to that idea, arguing Ukraine’s actions were simply not at all comparable to what Russia did, given Russia’s was an extensive, top-down effort that included a misinformation campaign,"" Blake writes. ""And indeed, she said Ukraine’s actions weren’t terribly dissimilar from officials in other countries who assumed Hillary Clinton would win the election and that they could criticize Trump.""

PINGED: China hawks in the Senate are demanding the administration suspend a new program granting licenses for U.S. firms to sell less-risky components to the Chinese telecom firm Huawei until Congress gets a briefing on the national security implications, my colleague Jeanne Whalen reports.

The letter from a bipartisan group of 15 senators also asks for a warning before the Commerce Department issues any additional licenses. And they criticize the administration for continuing to delay a blanket ban on sales to Huawei over Chinese spying concerns.

“National security experts widely agree that Chinese companies cooperate heavily with the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government is thought to exercise considerable influence over Huawei, in particular,” the letter led by Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) states.

The licenses “will allow Huawei to fully resume its engagement with certain U.S. firms without an adequate assessment of the risks to national security,” they write.

The Commerce Department has said the licenses it approved this week were for “limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Huawei has consistently denied aiding Chinese government spying.

PATCHED: Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are just a few of the nations emerging as major players in a cyberthreat space once dominated by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, a new report from the Aspen Institute's cyber and technology program finds. China, Russia, North Korea and Iran traditionally get the most attention for offensive cyber operations, but other nations are starting to catch up.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have also managed to increase their offensive hacking capabilities by employing private firms such as U.S.-based CyberPoint, the Israeli NSO Group, and other hackers for hire to compete for regional power and silence dissidents. The NSO Group recently came under fire for hacking into the WhatsApp accounts of human rights activists and journalists. Vietnam, meanwhile, has started to copy China's playbook by using state-sponsored hackers typically to target corporate competitors in the region. Romania, by contrast, has served as a safe haven for hackers. Brazilian hacking remains uniquely driven by internal motives, including profit-seeking by domestic crime groups and “hacktivists” trying to expose government corruption.

PWNED: Mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign has an unusual strategy to get ahead of the possibility bad actors could manipulate audio and video of him: nonstop surveillance.

“We keep the mayor in front of a camera basically all his waking hours,” the campaign's chief security officer Mick Baccio told an audience at the Cyberwarcon outside Washington yesterday. “So if there is that doctored video we have the original to combat it.”

Manipulated video content has been a concern for politicians since a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), slowed down to make her appear drunk, went viral this summer. Even after the video was debunked, it continued to spread on Facebook and other platforms. The viral nature of the manipulated video is one reason that keeping a video record may not be enough to combat the problem, Foreign Policy Research Institute research fellow Clint Watts says.

“The people that tend to believe these things are so wrapped up in political bias, you could show them the real video later and they still might not believe it,” he says.

Having real content archived or easily accessible on social media does allow the campaign to react more quickly to combat the disinformation, Watts says. “It does give them a counter weapon … but it’s not a silver bullet either,” he says.

Watts says that Buttigieg and other candidates should push for a partnership between the government and social media companies to create a verification process designating the time, date and origin of digital content to help users discern which content is authentic.

CHAT ROOM

Even outside the impeachment hearings, it has been hard for the cybersecurity world to avoid the ongoing attention to a debunked conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee faked a 2016 hack by Russia and hid a server full of emails somewhere in Ukraine.

Bloomberg News's William Turton detailed how the conspiracy theory followed CrowdStrike, which has been accused of helping with the hidden server, into a security conference:

“The field will narrow, and there’s going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don’t agree with and you don’t find them completely inspiring the way you’d like, I don’t care,” Obama said Thursday. “Because the choice is so stark and the stakes are so high that you cannot afford to be ambivalent in this race.”

“I’m always suspicious of purity tests during elections,” Obama said, according to the New York Times. “Because you know what? The country’s complicated.”

The former president’s remarks came at a private fundraiser in the town of Los Altos Hills, near San Jose, hosted by physician and political donor Karla Jurvetson, where attendees paid up to $355,000 to attend, Recode reported. Obama was joined by Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, who interviewed the former president in front of guests such as Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha, an actress and television show host, according to Recode.

In recent weeks, Obama has begun to emerge from the sidelines of the Democratic primary with headline-generating remarks about the 2020 race. His message to Democrats has hit the same notes throughout: Don’t stress too much, be mindful of losing touch with voters, and stay focused on the goal of beating Trump.

Obama’s engagement coincides with rising panic among some party figures that the liberal candidates are dragging the conversation too far to the left and that a more centrist, unifying approach will be required to defeat Trump next November.

Moderate Democratic candidates have attempted to seize their moment during a conversation dominated so far by liberal policies espoused by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.). At Wednesday night’s Democratic debate, candidates such as Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), along with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, elbowed their way to the fore with calls for “unity” and attacks on proposals to overhaul the health-care system with Medicare-for-all.

Meanwhile, two additional candidates with a centrist approach have attempted to join the fray: Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick entered the primary last week, and former New York mayor and billionaire Mike Bloomberg filed candidate paperwork on Thursday after initially ruling out a run.

Obama has so far declined to endorse in the 2020 Democratic primary, despite the fact that his former vice president, Joe Biden, is running, and Obama has also refrained from criticizing any candidate by name. But he has shared his general thoughts that to beat Trump, Democrats must be “bold in our vision” while staying “rooted in reality” so as not to turn away more-moderate voters.

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,” Obama said at a Nov. 15 meeting of the Democracy Alliance in Washington. “They like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn’t think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it’s important for us not to lose sight of that.

AD

AD

“My point is that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision,” he said Nov. 15, “we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party.”

The Supreme Court is reviewing the Trump administration’s effort to end the program.

AD

Trump made immigration — and the demonization of immigrants who came to the country illegally — a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and of his presidency, so Vela is surprised that Democrats have not made countering his message one of their top priorities, something deeply discussed at every debate, like health care.

AD

“What is going to happen with young individuals who didn’t qualify for DACA? What’s going to happen to the people who have been waiting in line for 20 years?” said Vela, 24, a college student who is studying political science. “Our immigration system is broken. It’s outdated. It’s not working. What are they going to do?”

As they watched Democrats churn through another event in the lengthy process of picking a presidential nominee, Vela and other young Latino voters with whom she watched the debate said they often feel forgotten. The first two nominating states, Iowa and New Hampshire, have overwhelmingly white populations; the fourth, South Carolina, has a large number of African American voters. The third voting state, Nevada, will highlight Latinos but has gotten far less attention from the candidates than the other three.

Most campaigns have not spent the time and money to fully engage Latino voters, who participate in elections at much lower rates than whites or African Americans. In Georgia, about 2 percent of voters in 2018 were Latino, even though Latinos make up about 10 percent of the population.

“There have been so many years of false promises where we have been let down by both parties,” Vela said. “When it comes to election time, we are used as a platform and then there’s nothing.”

The watch party she attended was organized by Latino Democratic Party leaders and held at Mariscos Mazatlan, a seafood grill in a suburban shopping plaza about 30 miles northeast of the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, where the debate was held. The restaurant, known for its ceviche and tropical drinks, is in the Pleasant Hill Plaza, home to a sprawling East Asian grocery store and restaurants serving Filipino cuisine, Peruvian burgers, Vietnamese pho, Colombian chicken, bubble tea, Korean barbecue, crepes and hibachi fare.

The gathering attracted about a dozen Latino 20-somethings, plus a young woman who came to the United States as a refu­gee from Bosnia, the son of Vietnamese immigrants, a handful of activists who work on immigrant rights issues, and a 55-year-old African American criminal defense lawyer who is running for district attorney in Gwinnett County.

It was the first time Jasmin Alvarez had watched a debate, and she was surprised the candidates spent so much time “throwing each other under the bus.” The 24-year-old has never voted but plans to do so next year. She has yet to pick a favorite candidate — or decide which candidates she doesn’t like — so the debate offered a sweeping introduction to the field.

Alvarez was thrilled to hear candidates asked to talk about lowering the cost of child care, the lack of paid parental leave and the gender pay gap, which is largest for Latinas. Those questions prompted snaps of approval from many Latinas and were opportunities for Alvarez to share her experiences with the young Latino activist sitting next to her.

“It’s true,” she said of the gender pay gap, adding that she works at an e-commerce company that started her at $10 per hour and then later hired some young men at $12 per hour. “They gave me a ‘raise,’ and I was like, ‘This isn’t a raise.’ ”

More than an hour into the debate, the camera panned over the 10 candidates standing on the stage, and one Latina at the restaurant suddenly blurted out: “Wait! Where’s Julián Castro?”

The others told her his polling numbers were too low to qualify. Castro, who served as housing secretary in the Obama administration, was by far the favorite candidate of the group — and everyone insisted it was not because he is the only Latino candidate.

“It’s because he’s the one who has talked about issues that are important to people of color,” said Gabriel Velazquez, 34, who owns the Taqueria El Mercadito in Gainesville, Ga. “If you ignore race, you’re not going to be a candidate for all of us. . . . You look at the top three candidates — a white woman and white men. I don’t say that to diss them, but I can’t ignore that it’s three white candidates.”

AD

AD

Velazquez hesitates to call himself a Democrat, “because both parties have ignored us,” but Trump’s presidency pushed him to get politically involved. He wants to hear Democratic candidates focus on police reform, combating systemic racism and providing reparations to the descendants of slaves, in addition to implementing universal health care through a program like Medicare-for-all. He is concerned that some candidates are easing off their support for Medicare-for-all, after polling showing voters are skeptical about its effects.

His “distant second” choice for president is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), because, he said, she has deeply researched plans backing up her ideas. But other than Castro and Warren, Velazquez said he can’t imagine voting for any of the others — especially if the nominee is a moderate such as former vice president Joe Biden or South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

“People will say: ‘But that means four more years of Trump,’ ” he said, making clear that he does not want that. “That matters to me, but I can’t sit here and give my vote to a candidate who ignores things like racism.”

Several debate-watchers said they were glad to hear the candidates talk about affordable housing, a growing problem in the Atlanta area, and voter suppression, which former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has sought to make a national issue. Throughout the night, several candidates said Democrats need to do more to connect with African Americans, who make up about a third of Georgia’s population, and address racial disparities in health care, pay and criminal justice.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) gave a passionate monologue about why “black voters are pissed off,” saying that politicians seem to pay attention to them only when they are running for office. Booker noted that Biden opposes the legalization of marijuana, which Booker said “is already legal for privileged people” because “the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.”

“Yup! Yup! Yup!” shouted Wesley Person, 55. He is running for district attorney in Gwinnett County against a 27-year incumbent on a platform of making the criminal justice system more equitable. “Cory Booker is right on.”

Other debate-watchers applauded along as Booker spoke, in what amounted to the most animated portion of the night.

AD

Person said his favorite candidate is Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) because of her time as a prosecutor, which he says was not perfect but “started a trend of progressive prosecution.” The lawyer said he has been disappointed with Biden for the same reasons that Booker gave on the debate stage.

AD

“God bless his heart, I think Vice President Biden lives in the past,” Person said, adding that the diverse 20-somethings around him are the future of the party and that leaders need to remember that.

A few minutes before 11 p.m., the restaurant closed for the night — an hour later than usual — and the group moved outside, chatting among themselves as the debate continued. Several people noted the heavy focus on Trump throughout the night.

“The conversation has to move past Trump,” Velazquez said. “We get it — Trump is a liar, Trump is a racist, Trump is a misogynist. But just being against Trump isn’t enough to win.”

THE BIG IDEA: “Godfather II” is the Francis Ford Coppola movie that’s been in the news lately. Roger Stone was convicted Nov. 15 of tampering with a witness and lying to Congress about his efforts to learn of hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election. An FBI agent testified at trial that President Trump’s longtime friend and former political strategist twice told an associate to do a “Frank Pentangeli” ahead of a deposition two years ago to avoid contradicting what Stone had previously told the House Intelligence Committee.

In that film, Pentangeli is about to begin his testimony during a congressional hearing into the Corleone organized crime family when Michael Corleone ominously enters the room with Pentangeli’s brother. Suddenly, Pentangeli clams up. “I don’t know nothin’ about that,” he insists. The judge in the Stone case rejected a request from prosecutors to play this clip at trial, accepting an argument from Stone’s lawyers that doing so could prejudice the jurors.

-- Fiona Hill’s epiphany that Gordon Sondland was running a “domestic political errand” for Trump conjured the climax of another Coppola classic. In “Apocalypse Now,” Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) finally tracks down Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) after his journey into the heart of Vietnam’s darkness.

“They told me that you had gone totally insane and that your methods were unsound,” Willard says.

Kurtz asks: “Are you an assassin?”

“I’m a soldier,” Willard answers.

“You’re neither,” replies Kurtz. “You’re an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill.”

-- Hill’s testimony on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee was almost as cinematic, and at times it felt like something that Coppola himself, now 80, might have directed. The former senior official on the National Security Council recalled confronting Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on June 18. “I actually said to him, ‘Who put you in charge of Ukraine?’ … I’ll admit I was a bit rude. And that’s when he told me, ‘The president.’ And that shut me up,” Hill said.

“I had not put my finger on that at the moment,” she continued, “but I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn’t fully coordinating. And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, ‘Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up.’ And here we are.”

Hill said that she later chastised Sondland for not coordinating with her, and he responded that he already was briefing Trump himself, plus acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-national security adviser John Bolton. “Who else,” Hill said Sondland asked her, “do I have to deal with?”

Hill said she finally realized while watching Sondland’s televised testimony on Wednesday that he was “absolutely right.”

“He wasn’t coordinating with us because we weren’t doing the same thing that he was doing,” Hill said. “He was being involved in a domestic political errand. And we were being involved in national security foreign policy.”

She testified that Bolton saw what was being “cooked up” as a “drug deal” and described Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, as a “hand grenade” who was going to “blow everyone up.”

Hill, with her British coal-miner daughter’s accent, exuded a no-nonsense vibe. The White House instructed her not to appear, but she complied with the House’s subpoena and came anyway. She was not deterred by criticism from Trump allies or death threats and doxing. The 54-year-old confirmed an anecdote of her steeliness from a New York Times profile that, when she was 11 years old, a boy set her pigtails on fire while she was taking a test — and she snuffed out the fire with her hands and finished the exam. “It is a true story,” Hill said, adding that there were “unfortunate consequences.”

“Afterward, my mother gave me a bowl haircut,” Hill lamented. “So, for the school photograph later in that week, I looked like Richard III.”

-- This whole mess stems, at least in part, from Trump’s expansive view of presidential powers. Set aside, for a moment, the growing body of evidence that Trump sought to coerce the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, his 2020 challenger, by holding up nearly $400 million in security assistance that had been approved by Congress and putting off a White House meeting with the country’s new president. Table the testimony that Trump told public officials to go “talk with Rudy,” his personal lawyer, to understand what he wanted from Ukraine, and unanswered questions about why Trump purportedly empowered Sondland to get involved in Ukraine policy, despite Ukraine not being part of the European Union. Look past the question of whether the president deserves to be impeached, an inherently political question.

Listen to Trump talk about this donnybrook specifically and the presidency generally, however, and it’s not at all clear that he thinks anything he’s accused of would have been inappropriate — if he did it. That’s not exculpatory, but it speaks volumes about his view of the presidency and raises a different set of questions about his fitness for the office.

Lawmakers asked the procession of witnesses this week whether the president’s purported behavior was inappropriate. They’ve asked, hypothetically, whether it’s okay for a governor to not fund a law enforcement agency if it doesn’t investigate an opponent. Even the witnesses called by Republicans agreed that this would be wrong.

Trump denies wrongdoing — as he always does — but it's unclear whether he thinks it's morally or legally problematic to seek foreign help for domestic political purposes. That might explain why he keeps describing as “perfect” the rough transcript of his July 25 call in which he asked for “a favor” as soon as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky broached his government’s desire to buy Javelin antitank missiles to fend off the Russian-backed separatists.

-- Trump likes to say he has an “absolute right” as president to do what he wants, whether it’s disclosing highly classified intelligence to Russian adversaries in the Oval Office, firing the FBI director and even pardoning himself. There are many more examples of Trump using this formulation and insisting that he has an “absolute right” to do what he wants as president.

The president has made increasingly provocative assertions of his own power since taking office almost three years ago. “Article II allows me to do whatever I want,” Trump said this summer. The president was making the point during an interview with ABC News that he could have fired Bob Mueller, who prepared the case against Stone, if he wanted to do so. He’s made variations of this statement several times in just the past few months, from a gaggle on the White House lawn to an 80-minute speech at a conference for pro-Trump students. “I have the right to do whatever I want as president,” Trump told the kids.

-- This, of course, is not true. Article II enumerates several specific powers for the president but by no means gives him total power. In fact, the impeachment clause is in Section Four of Article II. Removing a president for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors” is literally, by definition, a constitutional act.

During an appearance on Fox News two years ago, Trump was asked why he had left unfilled so many key political appointments at the State Department. “Let me tell you, the one that matters is me,” he replied. “I’m the only one that matters. Because when it comes to it, that’s what the policy is going to be. We don’t need all the people that they want.”

-- It’s not just Ukraine. Trump often mixes, or at least conflates, his private interests with the national interest. He’s shown no compunction about doing so. Trump pushed aides to choose his own resort in Doral, Fla., to host next year’s Group of Seven summit — and then backed off in the face of public backlash. Vice President Pence stayed at a Trump-owned property in Ireland that was hours away from his official meetings in Dublin because the president encouraged him to do so. The Air Force has scheduled up to 40 overnight stays at Trump’s property in Turnberry, Scotland.

-- Consider these three stories that have broken in the past 24 hours:

1) Trump is essentially charging the Secret Service to protect him. The U.S. Secret Service paid more than $250,000 to the president’s private businesses in just the first five months of his presidency — paying Trump’s company an average of nearly $2,000 per day. These new numbers come from credit card receipts obtained by the group Property of the People after an open-records lawsuit and detail additional revenue that Trump has taken from U.S. taxpayers. “The president has set up an extraordinary arrangement: He kept ownership of his businesses — and then visited them repeatedly, bringing along aides and security officials, and charging the government for what they bought,” David Fahrenthold, Jonathan O'Connell and Joshua Partlow report. “The documents do not give much detail about the spending. … The White House declined to comment. … The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. … A Secret Service spokeswoman declined to comment. …

“Previously, other records have shown that taxpayers covered the cost of Trump aides staying in the guest suites at Mar-a-Lago, at $546 per night. Taxpayers also paid for a $1,000 liquor tab rung up by Trump aides in a Mar-a-Lago bar. The Secret Service records released Thursday cover only the first five months of Trump’s term, during which he made 21 visits to Trump properties … Since then, Trump has made more than 100 additional visits to his properties. The Secret Service has not released records about those visits.”

2) The foreign emoluments clause gets most of the attention, but there’s also a domestic emoluments clause that legal experts say Trump may have violated. The president’s businesses have taken taxpayer money from governors seeking to curry favor with the president. The latest example: Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin stayed at Trump’s hotel when he came to Washington in January for two nights. Records obtained by The Post show that Kentucky taxpayers initially footed the $686 bill.

“Although Kentucky’s Republican Party reimbursed the state for Bevin’s stay two months later, the transaction may still run afoul of an anti-corruption provision of the Constitution,” O’Connell and Fahrenthold note. “In two cases wending their way through federal court, plaintiffs have alleged that Trump — by retaining his financial interest in his companies and doing business with state governments — has violated the Constitution’s domestic emoluments clause.

“A central example cited by plaintiffs has been visits to the hotel by … Republican Paul LePage, while he was governor of Maine. … Other guests have acknowledged staying at the hotel as a way of trying to curry favor with the president. … Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit are scheduled to hear arguments in the case Dec. 12 in Richmond, and legal experts expect that because no court has ever previously ruled on the emoluments provisions, the case is likely to reach the Supreme Court.”

3) A far-right group that believes Islamists are infiltrating the U.S. government will hold a banquet tomorrow at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club. Fahrenthold reports: “The group, the Center for Security Policy, has also spread the false idea that former president Barack Obama is a Muslim and alleged that mainstream Muslim organizations in the United States are secretly agents of anti-American jihad. The group has rented a ballroom for Saturday at Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla., for its annual Freedom Flame Award Dinner. The 200-person event, named after the group’s flaming-torch symbol, previously was held in New York City and Washington. … At this gala, a conservative group that wants to shape Trump’s public policy will also become his private customer. The permit says the Center for Security Policy event will cost $53,000.”

-- To channel a mentality Trump expressed in another context: When you’re a president, they let you do it.

QUOTE OF THE DAY: ""Where is Howard Baker?"" asked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, as he lamented the lack of House GOP defections.

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- No additional Intelligence Committee hearings are scheduled, though that can change if they can lock down additional witnesses. Committee staffers plan to release a report summarizing their findings based on the evidence that’s been presented during the hearings. Then the House Judiciary Committee will draft articles of impeachment, as soon as the week after Thanksgiving. (Karoun Demirjian, Elise Viebeck, Rosalind S. Helderman and Matt Zapotosky)

-- Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), the most moderate member on the Intelligence Committee, who is retiring and formerly served in the CIA, said as yesterday’s hearing wrapped up that what the president did was clearly “inappropriate” but not impeachable. If Hurd is toeing the line, it’s hard to see many — or any — House GOP defections.

-- The hearings have cemented House Democrats’ determination to proceed with impeachment. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report that the hearings have galvanized rank-and-file members and put the House on a clear trajectory toward impeachment: “‘The picture has been painted,’ said Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.). ‘This is a president who clearly tried to bribe a foreign government to investigate his opponent. I mean, and it’s almost like everyone in the room understands that. But some [Republicans] are arguing that the burden of proof is so high that it can’t be met.’ Some Democrats — including those holding some of the most vulnerable seats — said they were waiting to consider all the evidence before coming to a conclusion, but they also declined to identify any major gaps in evidence that they would want to see filled before a vote.”

-- A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday afternoon to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks. Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report: “The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, … the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely. …

“Even a two-week trial could run counter to what Trump has expressed privately. The president is ‘miserable’ about the impeachment inquiry and has pushed to dismiss the proceedings right away. … Still, administration officials are readying all options to present them to Trump, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone is preparing to mount a full defense of the president for an impeachment trial. … ‘I don’t want them to believe there’s an ability to dismiss the case before it’s heard,’ said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who was among the group of half a dozen GOP senators who met Thursday with White House officials to begin mapping out a trial strategy. ‘I think most everybody agreed, there’s not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call the case.’

“In addition to Graham, the meeting Thursday included Republican Sens. Mike Lee (Utah), Ron Johnson (Wis.), John Neely Kennedy (La.), Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Tom Cotton (Ark.), along with Cipollone; acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; and counselor Kellyanne Conway … Ultimately, Trump will make the final call on trial strategy, a senior administration official said.”

-- Graham, in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Pompeo to provide documents related to the Bidens, Ukraine and Burisma. Colby Itkowitz reports: “Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Joe Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation. Graham [said] in late October that he was under intense pressure to launch an investigation into Biden by Trump and his allies. But he said he would not ‘turn the Senate into a circus’ and would instead focus his committee’s work on the investigation into the Justice Department’s launch of the Russia investigation.” Apparently he's changed his mind after receiving pressure from the White House.

-- No precedent shields Trump from releasing his financial records, the top lawyer for the House argued in a filing with the Supreme Court. Robert Barnes reports: “House General Counsel Doug N. Letter said in a brief that the court’s precedents involving Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton make clear that the chief executive enjoys no special privilege to be free from investigation or legal action. The Supreme Court ‘has established that even a private citizen may invoke the courts’ subpoena power against the president in appropriate cases,’ the brief states. ‘In light of that settled law, it would hardly make sense to say that Congress, a coordinate branch, cannot use its own subpoena power in a matter involving the president.’” Letter added: ‘Each day of delay harms Congress by depriving it of important information it needs to carry out its constitutional responsibilities.”

-- The Justice Department inspector general found evidence that an FBI employee may have altered a document connected to court-approved surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser. Devlin Barrett, Ellen Nakashima and Matt Zapotosky report: Inspector General Michael Horowitz “concluded that the conduct did not affect the overall validity of the surveillance application. … The person under scrutiny has not been identified but is a low-level FBI lawyer who has since been forced out of the FBI. … The employee was forced out of the FBI after the incident was discovered, two U.S. officials said. Horowitz found that the employee erroneously indicated he had documentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis for the application. He then altered an email to back up that erroneous claim, they said.

“That conduct did not alter Horowitz’s finding that the surveillance application of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page had a proper legal and factual basis, the officials said. … Separately, Attorney General William P. Barr tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham to explore the origins of the FBI probe and U.S. intelligence agency activities aimed at the Trump campaign, and Durham is expected to pursue the allegation surrounding the altered document to see whether it constitutes a crime. ... Durham’s work is expected to continue well after publication of the inspector general’s report.”

-- Prosecutors behind an investigation into the Trump Organization have zeroed in on Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer, and his connection to the hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels. From ProPublica: “Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, or SDNY, contended that the Trump Organization had improperly booked reimbursements for the hush-money scheme as 'legal expenses,' with the aid of sham invoices. They granted legal immunity to Weisselberg and later closed their 18-month investigation with the guilty plea of one Trump associate, Michael Cohen. But Weisselberg’s immunity deal applied only to federal proceedings. Now [Cyrus] Vance’s state grand jury is examining whether Weisselberg, among others — and even the Trump Organization — should face state criminal charges for falsification of business records, according to a source familiar with the investigation. … Neither the president nor his sons appear to be in Vance’s crosshairs at this point in the investigation, which is at an early stage, according to the source familiar with the investigation. But, the source added, New York prosecutors are far from ruling that out.”

-- A new book written by Glenn Simpson and his partner Peter Fritsch, two operatives at Fusion GPS whose lives were upended by their role in the dissemination of the Steele dossier, vigorously defends their work. From the Atlantic: “Accustomed to writing the story, the two ex-journalists, Simpson and Fritsch, had now become one. Since the dossier’s publication, they have been sued and hauled before Congress. They’ve had company bank records examined by Republican-controlled congressional committees and been targets of sustained attacks by the opinion writers at their old newspaper [the Wall Street Journal]. They feared the firm would be bankrupted by legal fees, and they worried for their safety. That wasn’t paranoia: Trump used his Twitter feed to repeatedly attack the firm by name and discredit the dossier. …

“Some important assertions in the dossier remain unconfirmed. No pee tape has surfaced, nor is there any evidence that [Cohen] traveled to Prague during the 2016 campaign to meet with Kremlin officials and discuss payments to hackers, as the dossier alleged. Still, Simpson and Fritsch argue that the report was accurate in its warnings about Trump’s conduct and Russia’s willingness to undermine Western democracies. They note that the dossier mentioned how Russia had sought to woo Trump through real-estate deals. Trump long denied that he had any business dealings in Russia, though evidence emerged last year that Cohen had been talking with Russian figures about a Trump real-estate deal in Moscow deep into the 2016 campaign. 'After three years of investigations, a fair assessment of the memos would conclude that many of the allegations in the dossier have been borne out,' the authors write in the book’s epilogue. 'Some proved remarkably prescient. Other details remain stubbornly unconfirmed, while a handful now appear to be doubtful, though not yet disproven.'”

-- Hill also testified that conspiracy theories are as effective at advancing Russia’s agenda as they are at dividing Americans. Greg Miller reports: “‘Our nation is being torn apart,’ she said. ‘Truth is questioned.’ … Trump’s allies … [have] used the impeachment hearings to advance murkier claims that Ukraine sought to undermine Trump in the 2016 election. Hill treated such claims with scorn. ‘I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine — not Russia — attacked us in 2016,’ she said.”

-- In Ukraine, the U.S. impeachment inquiry has been met with a big yawn. Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern are on the ground: “Ukrainian leaders have done their best to stay out of it, seeing only peril in commenting for fear that Democrats or Republicans could use them as cudgels in their partisan brawl. Local media is filled with domestic intrigue about leaked corruption-related recordings, uncertain prospects for peace in eastern Ukraine and questions about where Ukraine’s comedian-turned-president … is taking the nation. And in the capital, Kyiv, ordinary citizens are far more focused on their own pocketbook concerns. … Protesters plan to mount a rally Thursday evening to press Zelensky to hold firm against Russia in his effort to bring peace to eastern Ukraine — the issue that is probably the biggest and most divisive in the country right now.”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULDN’T BE OVERSHADOWED:

-- Pentagon officials were mostly kept out of the loop as outsiders lobbied Trump for war crime pardons. Dan Lamothe and Josh Dawsey report: “Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, who faced a murder trial next year in the 2010 death of a suspected Taliban bombmaker, said he expected the call to be quick. But Trump talked to him for nearly 15 minutes, asking questions about his plans for the future and the Pentagon’s application of military justice. ‘I’m paraphrasing here, but he asked, ‘Did you feel like you were going to get a fair shake or that it was slanted or biased against you?’’ Golsteyn said in an interview. ‘I told him, ‘Sir, it was quite clear that the outcome was fixed.’ And he said, ‘Yeah, that was my thought, as well.’’ Trump’s intervention in the cases prompted a sharp backlash from some veterans and legal experts, who said that it will undermine the military justice system and weaken U.S. credibility abroad. But on Thursday, Trump weighed in again, saying in a tweet that he will not allow one of the service members [Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher] to be ejected from the Navy SEALs. Rear Adm. Charles Brown, the Navy’s top spokesman, said in a statement Thursday night that the service is aware of the president’s tweet and awaiting further guidance.

“How Trump came to believe that the Pentagon could not handle the cases fairly, and ultimately issue the pardons, reflects his tendency to accept the advice of people outside his administration. The president mostly left defense officials out of his discussions about the issue until a few weeks ago and told his top advisers that his supporters would back the move, according to five officials familiar with the situation. Instead, the officials said, Trump discussed the issue with other people in his orbit, including Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality who highlighted the cases on his show and described the service members as heroes facing malicious prosecution. Trump called Hegseth numerous times to discuss the issue and told others about the conversations, according to one current and one former administration official.”

-- Trump made an unannounced visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to receive the remains of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Toluse Olorunnipa reports: “David Knadle and Kirk Fuchigami Jr., who each held the rank of chief warrant officer 2, were killed Wednesday in a helicopter crash … Both men are Bronze Star recipients and both deployed to Afghanistan in October. … Trump traveled to Dover with first lady Melania Trump; Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and White House aides. After meeting with the families of the fallen soldiers, Trump stood silently and saluted as the men’s remains were carried by a group of service members and transferred into a waiting van. The actor Jon Voight, whom Trump awarded the National Medal of the Arts on Thursday, also attended the dignified transfer ceremony. Voight told reporters he did not meet with family members of the fallen soldiers. He said Trump invited him to attend the ceremony.”

-- The Department of Veterans Affairs put “millions of people at risk of identity theft” by not deleting personally identifying information from records released while responding to a request for documents. Eric Yoder reports: “That information included names and Social Security numbers of people such as other military personnel and doctors who had treated the veteran, said an inspector general report issued last week. The report said people whose names were in the records were not informed that their information had been released, ‘meaning individuals at risk of identity theft might not be aware of that risk.’ Under a policy that started in May 2016, the Veterans Benefits Administration, a sub-agency of VA, stopped redacting personal information on other people from those files, which can be requested under the Privacy Act.”

-- A government shutdown has been averted — for now. Erica Werner reports: “Trump signed a short-term spending bill Thursday to keep the government open through late December, staving off a shutdown that would have begun at midnight. Trump’s signature on the stopgap spending bill came following Senate passage of the legislation on a bipartisan 74-to-20 vote. The House passed it earlier in the week in the midst of public impeachment hearings. … The bill extends government funding through Dec. 20, setting up a fight over money for Trump’s border wall that could happen around the same time the House is voting on articles of impeachment. ... It is the second stopgap spending bill Congress has been forced to pass to keep the lights on in government for the 2020 budget year that began Oct. 1. … Trump and Senate Republicans want $5 billion for the wall, but House Democrats included no such money at all in the spending bills they passed. It remains unclear where a compromise might lie. By extending funding through Dec. 20, lawmakers hope to give themselves time to come up with a deal on that issue and others that would allow them to pass full-year bills to fund the government for the rest of the budget year that ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- White House officials will present Trump with a plan to crack down on homelessness in California as soon as next week, and a top federal housing official who was appointed during the Obama years has been ousted. Jeff Stein, Josh Dawsey and Tracy Jan report: ""Trump will be able to select ideas for how to address the growing homeless problem in several major cities. One person involved in deliberations said the administration’s plans are likely to target homelessness in Los Angeles and could include repurposing existing federal property, but the exact set of policy options to be presented to the president could not be learned. … The accelerating plans follow Trump’s demands to aides over the summer to do something about the homeless crisis in cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. …

“Rumors of the crackdown have generated concern among career officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as national housing experts, who worry Trump is trying to exploit the issue for political gain while offering solutions that could make the problem worse. Those fears flared up again when Matthew Doherty, who until Friday served as executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, was told ‘the administration no longer wishes to have me,’ according to an email Doherty sent to colleagues outside the government. On Tuesday, career staff at HUD were told at an internal meeting that Doherty was not willing to compromise his principles and follow the Trump administration’s lead on homelessness policy, according to a person who attended the meeting.”

-- Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has weakened safety rules dictating how companies need to store dangerous chemicals. The rules were enacted in the wake of a 2013 explosion in West, Tex., that killed 15. Juliet Eilperin reports: “Under the new standards, companies will not have to provide public access to information about what kinds of chemicals are stored on their sites. They also will not have to undertake several measures aimed at preventing accidents, such as analyzing safer technology and procedures, conducting a ‘root-cause analysis’ after a major chemical release or obtaining a third-party audit when an accident has occurred. In a statement, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the revised ‘Risk Management Program’ rule addresses concerns raised by security experts, who feared that releasing the location of the country’s chemical stores could provide a road map for terrorists, as well as others.”

-- The Trump administration unveiled a plan that could allow oil drilling on over three-quarters of the nation’s largest piece of unprotected wilderness, overhauling a 2013 plan that limited development on the Alaskan reserve. Eilperin reports: “The 23-million acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which is roughly the size of Indiana, has attracted relatively little public attention compared with the neighboring Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But it ranks as one of the most ecologically valuable and promising oil prospects in the country. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management announced it is considering four possible options for the reserve, from slightly scaling back the 11.7 million acres eligible for development to expanding the leasing area to 18.3 million acres. The Obama administration had put half of the reserve off limits to development six years ago, on the grounds that specific areas provided crucial habitat for hundreds of thousands of migrating birds and tens of thousands of caribou. But it is also the site of significant oil deposits, and recent findings suggest that it could hold as much as 8.7 billion barrels in undiscovered oil.”

President Trump pats Justice Anthony Kennedy on the back after last October's swearing-in ceremony for Brett Kavanaugh. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

-- Anthony Kennedy suggested Brett Kavanaugh as his replacement to Trump, according to a new book by deputy editorial page editor Ruth Marcus. Kennedy had a secret meeting with the president at the White House after a Rose Garden ceremony in April 2017 to swear in Neil Gorsuch, who like Kavanaugh was a former law clerk. Kennedy requested the private moment, Marcus reports, and told Trump that Kavanaugh should be on his shortlist. “The justice’s message to the president was as consequential as it was straightforward, and it was a remarkable insertion by a sitting justice into the distinctly presidential act of judge picking,” Marcus writes in “Supreme Ambition: Brett Kavanaugh and the Conservative Takeover.” Kennedy announced his retirement 14 months later — after Kavanaugh’s name was added to Trump’s public list by Don McGahn, Robert Barnes notes. “Marcus’s book, to be published Dec. 3, is at least the fifth to examine Kavanaugh’s nomination and confirmation. It does not attempt to prove or undermine the allegations against him …

“White House adviser Kellyanne Conway reported to Trump and her colleagues [in the spring of 2017] that she had spoken with Kennedy’s son Gregory Kennedy at the annual white-tie Alfalfa Club dinner. No one was happier about the outcome of the election than his father, Gregory Kennedy said, according to the book. … Marcus writes he wanted to be replaced by another Republican. ‘That’s good to know,’ Conway replied, according to the book. ‘That happiness has consequences.’ (In a footnote, Marcus says that Gregory Kennedy denied in an email this summer that he talked to Conway that night about his father.) … When Kennedy met with Trump on June 28, 2018, to say he was retiring, Kennedy suggested Kavanaugh as his replacement, Marcus reports …

“She quotes an anonymous White House official as saying he ‘had the most intense lobbying campaign inside and outside the White House.’ … She writes that a ‘delegation’ of former Kavanaugh clerks made a presentation to the influential Leonard A. Leo of the Federalist Society to try to persuade him that Kavanaugh was sufficiently conservative. Still, the nomination was not in the bag. Leo continued to advocate for a more conservative candidate, although his well-publicized role in the process annoyed Trump, the book says. ‘That [expletive] Leonard Leo yapping his mouth,’ the book quotes Trump as telling an adviser after seeing Leo on television. ‘Everybody should just keep quiet. I make the decisions here.’”

-- Former Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh pleaded guilty to fraud-and-tax-evasion conspiracies to illegally hide profits from sales of her children’s books to enhance her political and personal fortunes. Pugh’s acknowledgment of guilt in four of the 11 charges filed against her came during a court hearing in downtown Baltimore, the city the disgraced 69-year-old once led. Peter Hermann, Lynh Bui and Ann E. Marimow report: “Authorities in April searched Baltimore City Hall, Pugh’s homes and a nonprofit organization tied to her, seeking financial documents and other information related to almost $800,000 she allegedly was paid for her self-published books. … Most of the books in Pugh’s transactions were marketed and sold directly to nonprofit organizations and foundations, many of which did business or tried to get business with the state and city of Baltimore. … In all, court records show, Pugh took purchase orders for roughly 124,000 books but had printers produce only 63,210. ...

“Pugh’s hearing surfaced new details about at least one book purchaser, who Pugh said in her plea agreement was aware his payments were being diverted to aid Pugh personally. In the lead-up to the 2016 mayoral primary, J.P. Grant, the owner of Grant Capital Management — a financing company in Columbia, Md., that did business with the city — wrote a $50,000 check to Healthy Holly LLC, court filings show. Grant understood, according to Pugh’s agreement, that the money was intended to produce books for Baltimore students, with the balance going to her campaign. One month after the general election, Pugh told Grant she 'wanted to buy a larger house so she could entertain people when she became mayor' and she took Grant to see the property, according to the agreement she signed. Pugh suggested that Grant write another check to Healthy Holly LLC, this time for $100,000, with the understanding that some money would help her buy the home. None of the money went to print or deliver books to school students.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed papers to join the Democratic race. Michael Scherer reports: “Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision. An adviser said the timing of the filing was triggered by his earlier application for a spot on the Alabama ballot. But Bloomberg’s team has been moving swiftly over the past two weeks to rebuild a presidential campaign operation that was scuttled after he decided earlier this year not to run. … Bloomberg is positioned to be a force to counter the candidates who emerge from the first four nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In defiance of the traditional nominating calendar, Bloomberg has planned to skip those contests to spend heavily in states that will vote in March — including California, Texas and 12 other states that will award delegates on Super Tuesday.”

-- Terrible advance work: Deval Patrick canceled an event at Morehouse College in Atlanta when he showed up on Wednesday night and only two people had come to see him speak. It's an illustration of how little appetite there is for the former Massachusetts governor and also a reminder of how hard it is to jump into the contest so late. (Katie Mettler)

-- The moderates already in the race are striking back in a presidential contest defined so far by liberal litmus tests and one-upmanship. Sean Sullivan reports: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in a well-received debate performance, railed against the costs of the government giving too much away. Sen. Cory Booker cast doubt on a tax on the super-wealthy. … The presidential campaign’s ideological battle is far from settled, however, with staunchly liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) showing a resurgence since his Oct. 1 heart attack. His improvement has put pressure on the other leader on the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), to stand firmly behind liberal priorities as she seeks at the same time to broaden her appeal to more traditional Democrats. …

“The tone of Wednesday’s debate stood in contrast to earlier showdowns that had more anti-establishment, leftward bents. Where there was once criticism from Obama’s left about the former president, Wednesday brought nothing but praise for him, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris’s calls to ‘rebuild the Obama coalition.’ The name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who routinely has counseled a middle course, was invoked positively. The heated exchanges over highly charged issues such as gun buybacks and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings that headlined earlier debates were nowhere to be found.”

-- It seems as if the Democratic candidates have heeded Obama’s warning and discovered that ordinary voters matter more than social-media warriors. From Politico founder John F. Harris: “It often seemed like the candidates had taken to heart Obama’s paternal sermon last week, in which he said is not worried about a long and 'robust' primary process, but urged candidates not to orient their appeals around ‘left-leaning Twitter feeds’ and to recognize that the ‘average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.’ Even Sanders, who has described himself as a revolutionary, said he agreed with Obama. ‘We don’t have to tear down the system but we do have to do what the American people want,’ he said, especially with a health care system that is ‘cruel’ and ‘dysfunctional.’”

-- In Atlanta, Democrats made an urgent bid to court black voters. Chelsea Janes and Sean Sullivan report: “Booker was roaring through metaphors Thursday, quoting Scripture and Langston Hughes to a chorus of ‘Amen!’ and ‘Preach!’ in a room full of African American ministers, when a door opened a few feet away. A staffer ushered in South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who hunched over to sneak past Booker, trying not to interrupt or offend. He took a seat next to the Rev. Al Sharpton, then stood and clapped politely as the audience rose to its feet in raucous applause for Booker’s stemwinder. Toward the back of the room, an attendee observed the entrance of Buttigieg, who was set to follow Booker onstage. ‘Pete’s like, ‘What the hell am I going to do now?!’’ he mused to a friend, and the two dissolved in laughter. Buttigieg and Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday … in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for [Biden] — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances?”

-- Some Latino debate-watchers were disappointed by the few answers the debate offered to their most important questions. Jenna Johnson reports: As the debate “neared its second hour and paused for a commercial break, Diana Vela turned to her friends: ‘I’m waiting for the immigration question. I want to know: Am I getting deported or not?’ Although [Trump’s] wall along the southern border was mentioned, fixing the immigration system was not. … Trump made immigration — and the demonization of immigrants who came to the country illegally — a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and of his presidency, so Vela is surprised that Democrats have not made countering his message one of their top priorities, something deeply discussed at every debate, like health care. … As they watched Democrats churn through another event in the lengthy process of picking a presidential nominee, Vela and other young Latino voters with whom she watched the debate said they often feel forgotten. … Most campaigns have not spent the time and money to fully engage Latino voters, who participate in elections at much lower rates than whites or African Americans. In Georgia, about 2 percent of voters in 2018 were Latino, even though Latinos make up about 10 percent of the population.”

-- Wednesday’s debate on MSNBC captured only 6.5 million viewers overall, making it the least-watched of this cycle. It's a reminder that impeachment has frozen the 2020 race in many ways. (Variety)

-- Biden’s verbal stumbles have some voters worried about his mental fitness. But maybe they’d be more understanding if they knew he’s fighting a stutter, writes the Atlantic’s John Hendrickson: “His eyes fall to the floor when I ask him to describe it. We’ve been tiptoeing toward it for 45 minutes, and so far, every time he seems close, he backs away, or leads us in a new direction. There are competing theories in the press, but [Biden] has kept mum on the subject. I want to hear him explain it. I ask him to walk me through the night he appeared to lose control of his words onstage. ‘I — um — I don’t remember,’ Biden says. His voice has that familiar shake, the creak and the croak. ‘I’d have to see it. I-I-I don’t remember.’ … He stutters — ­if slightly — on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. Before addressing the debate specifically, I mention what I’ve just heard. ‘I want to ask you, as, you know, a … stutterer to, uh, to a … stutterer. When you were … talking a couple minutes ago, it, it seemed to … my ear, my eye … did you have … trouble on s? Or on … m?’ Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific — ' He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”

-- Buttigieg’s campaign staff is unionizing. From the HuffPost: “Buttigieg’s campaign still needs to reach a contract agreement with the workers, who are joining the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2321, which is based in North Andover, Massachusetts. The union will only represent campaign staff with the title of ‘organizer.’ The agreement means three of the four leading Democratic presidential campaigns are now unionized. [Biden’s] campaign is not. ”

-- Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is resisting pressure from Trump on the person to appoint to an interim U.S. Senate post. From the Journal: “In recent days, the president has spoken to Mr. Kemp at least twice — once face-to-face in Atlanta and once on the phone — urging him to pick Rep. Doug Collins (R., Ga.), a vocal supporter of the president in Congress ... Mr. Collins, a white conservative from north Georgia, has pushed for months to get the seat that Sen. Johnny Isakson, 74 years old, is leaving at the end of the year because of health problems. But the governor is leaning toward appointing a female or minority candidate to improve the GOP’s chances in Atlanta’s burgeoning suburbs, key battlegrounds in the 2020 elections.”

-- Campaigns say Google’s new restrictions on political advertising just sidestep the company’s problem with disinformation. From the Times: “The decision to limit campaigns from targeting users based on political affiliation or voter record, which Google announced Wednesday night, was aimed at addressing concerns about invasion of privacy and the exploitation of voters through hyperspecific targeting. But the policy will most likely have little impact on the thornier challenge of disinformation, which campaigns and cybersecurity experts say will be the more urgent problem facing the major social media platforms during the 2020 election. Google’s new policy restricts a tactic — microtargeting of voters — that campaigns heavily rely on, while not aggressively addressing misinformation. … On Thursday, two separate groups of digital strategists — a bipartisan coalition from the University of Chicago, and a group of roughly 40 Democratic and progressive strategists — released letters criticizing Google’s new policy. The letters … both fault Google for not adequately addressing disinformation.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was formally charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, making him the first Israeli premier to be indicted while in office and sending the country’s stalemated political system deeper into disarray. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit capped almost three years of investigation and months of speculation by issuing a 63-page indictment against the country’s longest-serving prime minister and its center of political gravity for the last decade. The cases against Netanyahu center on allegations that the prime minister and his wife, Sara, accepted more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods in exchange for political favors and that Netanyahu interceded with regulators and lawmakers on behalf of two media companies in exchange for positive news stories.

“Netanyahu, 70, has steadfastly denied wrongdoing during a wide-ranging probe that he has dismissed as a politically motivated ‘witch hunt.’ … Few here expect the pugnacious prime minister to do anything ­other than ferociously fight the counts that emerged. Many predict he will seek a vote in parliament granting him some measure of immunity. In a combative address Thursday night, Netanyahu called the indictment ‘a coup attempt’ driven by a corrupt set of prosecutors. He demanded that an independent body review the prosecution. ‘It’s time to investigate the investigators,’ he said.” Sound familiar? It's the same language Trump uses.

-- In Hong Kong, protesters trickled out from a besieged campus as the city prepares for elections. Simon Denyer, Tiffany Liang and Anna Kam report: “Half a dozen protesters, holding hands and wearing face masks, walked out of a besieged Hong Kong university campus and surrendered to police early Friday, leaving only a handful inside after a week-long standoff. Two more followed later, news agencies reported, bringing to around 30 the number who have surrendered in the past day at the Polytechnic University, which front-line pro-democracy protesters had occupied and transformed into a fortified base. … Surrounded by riot police, around 800 protesters surrendered Monday, with adults immediately arrested by police and hundreds of minors allowed to go free after having their names taken, but around 100 were believed to have remained inside.

“Police have said those who surrender could face charges of rioting, which carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence, and there have been fears of more violence if police storm the campus. So far, though, the police have been content to wait out the remaining protesters, whose supplies are diminishing. … On online forums and message groups, protesters advised each other not to wear black — the unofficial uniform of the pro-democracy movement — on Election Day for fear of being detained and denied the right to vote.”

-- Under U.S. pressure, South Korea said it would maintain an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan for now. Min Joo Kim and Simon Denyer report: “Seoul announced Friday it would suspend its decision to terminate the General Security of Military Intelligence Agreement (GSOMIA), hours before the pact was due to expire at midnight local time. Its initial decision not to renew the pact, announced three months ago, came under intense criticism from Washington, which believes that intelligence sharing between its two most important Asian allies is crucial to counter threats from North Korea and China. Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris told the Yonhap news agency that South Korea’s actions put U.S. troops at risk. But Seoul’s decision to postpone its exit from the pact was conditional, again restating a demand that Tokyo reverse an earlier decision to place controls on its exports to South Korea. Friday’s announcement could be seen as giving the two sides breathing space to find a solution to their spat, or as simply kicking the can a little farther down the road.”

-- In Iran, “rage is escalating” as economic stress reaches new levels. Erin Cunningham reports: “The protests have flared in many of the same areas that experienced unrest two years ago, when demonstrators protested a similar proposal to slash state subsidies. Then, as now, lower-income Iranians rose up against a system that they said had failed them economically. But a wider spectrum of society may have joined the revolt this time around, analysts say, pointing to demonstrations in major cities and at universities, including the University of Tehran. Protesters have also clashed with police in urban centers such as Isfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz and Tabriz. Over the past two years, Iran’s economy has worsened because of U.S. sanctions and declining oil sales — revenue the government uses to pay salaries and fund imports. Iran’s economy is expected to contract by 8.7 percent this year, according to the World Bank.”

-- Argentine prosecutors are calling for the international arrest of Gustavo Zanchetta, a Catholic bishop who worked closely with Pope Francis and who’s being accused of sexual abuse. Authorities claim he has gone dark inside Vatican City. Chico Harlan reports: “‘The [request] was imposed after the accused did not respond to repeated phone calls or emails, to the phone number and email voluntarily shared by him’ with authorities, according to a statement from an Argentine provincial prosecutors’ office. The attempt to bring Zanchetta back to Argentina sets up a potential conflict with the Vatican. It raises pressure on the pope to comply with a criminal justice proceeding, after outside experts have called on the church to be more cooperative with civil authorities. And it puts Francis’s judgment under the spotlight. Italian news media reported that Zanchetta is accused of abusing two adult seminarians. Zanchetta, 55, could not be immediately reached for comment. A Vatican spokesman, who is traveling with the pope in Thailand, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.”

-- Thousands of union members and anti-government protesters took to the streets of Colombia, making the Andean nation the latest in South America to break out in large-scale civil unrest. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “The protesters, who waved flags and banners, represented a range of disgruntled sectors of society — students, unions, and leftist and indigenous groups — that share rising anger against the increasingly unpopular government of conservative President Iván Duque. In Bogota, the capital, protesters waved the flags of Chile and Ecuador and carried banners that read ‘South America woke up’ and chanted ‘without violence.’ Videos circulating on social media showed riot police firing tear gas and apprehending demonstrators. Initially called by unions, the strike grew as other sectors joined in, furious over labor, pension and tax reforms being discussed in the national Congress, the killings of community organizers and indigenous leaders, and general dissatisfaction with the government’s failure to fully implement the historic 2016 peace accord with the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.”

-- Graphic videos and images showed a vehicle driving into crowds of Chilean protesters, an incident that could intensify already violent clashes in the country over inequality and economic disparities. Michael Brice-Saddler and Rachelle Krygier report: “The attack appeared to take place Thursday evening in Chile’s northern province of Antofagasta. In videos, protesters dive out of the way as a car speeds down the street into demonstrators. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people were injured as a result. … In response to the protests, which have already resulted in as many as 20 deaths as well as thousands of injuries and arrests, President Sebastián Piñera declared the country was at war — which only served to intensify the protesters’ furor. As videos of Thursday’s attack circulated on social media, people attempted to identify the car and its driver. Some pointed out that after the car drove off, a similar-looking vehicle was seen entering a local police station in Antofagasta. By Thursday night, the Chilean national police force confirmed the attack took place, tweeting that the person responsible had been delivered to their headquarters in Antofagasta.”

Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images

After he emerged unscathed from a presidential candidates’ debate in Atlanta, where many expected him to become a piñata, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg is heading toward the holidays in an enviable position in Iowa and New Hampshire polls. He appears to have plenty of money, a solid organization, and a degree of popularity that is likely to improve as he becomes better known (according to Morning Consult, 39 percent of Democratic primary voters don’t know enough about him to form an opinion). And it’s entirely possible that six of his rivals will be spending crucial days leading up to the early-state contests stuck in Washington in an impeachment trial with constraints on their ability to speak freely.

It is probably time, then, to think seriously about this unlikely candidate as a potential challenger to Donald Trump. To ask the slippery but inevitable question that anxious Democratic voters appear to keep in the back (if not the front) of their minds, is Mayor Pete electable?

For those who place faith in early head-to-head polls (which have a shaky reputation for reliability), there’s limited relevant data, since Buttigieg wasn’t often tested against Trump until recently. He has a 2.8 percent advantage over the president in the RealClearPolitics polling averages (not that impressive compared to Biden’s 9.6 percent edge, or Sanders’s 7.9 percent, or Warren’s 6.8 percent). But his relatively low name ID may artificially depress his numbers. Political scientist Robert Griffin estimates that Buttigieg’s six-point matchup advantage over Trump in one poll would jump to ten percent if he became as well-known as the Big Three.

Concerns about the mayor’s electability, though, are less about numbers than about questions concerning the coalition of voters he might or might not put together. Ironically, the candidate whose rhetoric and ideology are strikingly reminiscent of the 44th president’s has generated more skepticism than any of his rivals in terms of reviving the Obama coalition that once seemed to promise Democrats perpetual victory.

Despite his youth — which he emphasizes regularly on the campaign trail — Buttigieg isn’t notably lighting up young people. A new Civiqs poll of Iowa that shows him with a solid overall lead also shows him trailing septuagenarians Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren among under-35 voters, while he leads the field among seniors.

Buttigieg’s overwhelmingly white base of support has gotten a lot of attention. In a recent Latino Decisions poll of California Latinos, he came in at one percent, a point behind Andrew Yang. And his inability to attract African-American support is becoming even more conspicuous as his strength in mostly white places like Iowa and New Hampshire grows. Whether you think his problem in this demographic stems from the problems he’s had in South Bend with police-minority relations, or from his sexual orientation, or from his general “wine track” political style, it’s real, and it presents a real obstacle in his path to the nomination — particularly when the majority-black electorate in South Carolina weighs in on February 29. A new Quinnipiac poll of the Palmetto State released earlier this week gives Buttigieg a flat zero percent among black voters. And here’s how Reid Epstein summarizes the mayor’s visible black supporters:

Mr. Buttigieg has so few black elected officials and former elected officials backing him that they could all fit into a single S.U.V. The issue emerged during a meeting he held this summer with Congressional Black Caucus members who pressed him about why he did not have black officials from South Bend vouching for him on the campaign trail.

Of the black elected officials and former elected officials who have endorsed him, only Sean Shaw, a former one-term Florida state representative who lost his statewide race last year, has been to South Carolina on his behalf.

The vibe could soon get worse:

Our Revolution, a political organization backing Mr. Sanders, is planning a Dec. 7 rally in South Bend that will highlight Mr. Buttigieg’s handling of the June police shooting and feature a black South Bend Common Council member aggrieved that two of her properties were razed by Mr. Buttigieg’s municipal government.

Putting aside the impact of Buttigieg’s narrow band of support on what you might call his “nominatability,” though, does it mean he would lose a general election to the likes of Donald Trump? That’s hard to say.

Without question, Democrats are counting on minority-voter enthusiasm in 2020, and having a nominee who leaves black and brown voters cold could be a serious problem, particularly in the Rust Belt states where mediocre black-voter turnout was a factor in Hillary Clinton’s shocking 2016 loss. But then again, after three years of the racist stylings of the president, African-Americans may not need much motivation to turn out to smite him next year. As Frank Newport of Gallup noted this week, Trump’s job approval rating among black voters has been stuck at 10 to 11 percent since his inauguration, a number likely to produce a general-election showing in the single digits. If Trump decides, as is likely, to rev up his base with some unusually crude appeals to white identity politics, Buttigieg’s black enthusiasm problem could vanish. It’s also likely that Mayor Pete’s ambitious “Douglass Plan” for black empowerment, which has so far failed to move primary voters in his direction, would look much better to African-American voters in the context of a general-election contest with Trump.

It’s even more likely that the progressive activists who are currently expressing hostility to Buttigieg would come around. Much as they dislike Medicare for All Who Want It, it’s infinitely preferable to such Republican policy wish-list items as privatizing Medicare, repealing Obamacare, and radically cutting Medicaid.

In the end, though, a vote’s a vote, and the real question is whether Buttigieg could reach enough voters other potential nominees would miss to offset some turnout gaps. In that vein, his regional appeal is certainly germane to his competitiveness in those same Rust Belt states that Clinton lost. And the very wine-track style that creates problems with some voters may attract others — particularly those Republican-leaning suburbanites who helped Democrats retake the House last year.

One unavoidable question about Buttigieg is whether being the first openly gay major-party presidential nominee would be a net positive or negative. It’s almost impossible to calculate. The percentage of Americans saying they would be fine with a gay president is steadily rising, but a recent Morning Consult survey showed 37 percent weren’t ready for it. Recognizing that a solid majority of such voters probably wouldn’t vote for any liberal, it’s simply not clear whether the “backlash” to Buttigieg’s sexual orientation would exceed the “frontlash” from voters, including LGBTQ voters, pleased to break this particular barrier. And regardless of objective reality, yet another “nominatability” problem for Mayor Pete is that risk-averse Democrats might not want to test the proposition in this particular cycle, when a second Trump term is the punishment for guessing wrong.

If Buttigieg does, against the odds, become the Democratic presidential nominee in Milwaukee next July, he would be in a position to campaign as the ultimate un-Trump: progressive where Trump is reactionary; multilingual where Trump is barely literate in English; a meritocrat running against a great symbol of inherited privilege; a vet opposing a draft dodger; an observant Christian exposing the shallow belief system of a philistine and heathen. And in fact, that’s a context in which Buttigieg’s Obama-style rhetoric of unity and uplift might strike some sparks, instead of just reminding those who affectionately harken back to Trump’s predecessor of what the country has lost."

Among the vast compendium of lore thrown into political discourse by the Iowa Caucuses over the last 40 years or so is this famous slogan from former Democratic congressman Dave Nagle:

There are three rules to success in Iowa … Rule No. 1 is: Organize. Rule No. 2 is: Organize. Rule No. 3 is: You get hot at the end.

This last part about the value of peaking at the right moment is good advice for the candidates forming the Big Four in recent polls of likely caucusgoers (Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden) and for those bottom-feeders thought by some to have a chance of coming from the back of the pack down the home stretch (notably Amy Klobuchar). But simple as Nagle’s three rules are, recent Caucus history is a little more complicated than that, since the “end” at which you need to get “hot” is defined in different ways by different people. Katie Akin of the Des Moines Register offers a useful rundown on the path to victory on Caucus Night of various recent winning candidates in both parties:

Hillary Clinton stayed at the top of 2015 and 2016 Iowa polls, as rival Bernie Sanders climbed steadily closer. The final poll before the caucus had Clinton just 3 points above Sanders, 45 percent to 42 percent. Ted Cruz surged in December, taking first place with 31 percent. No November poll was conducted in 2016. Cruz lost his polling lead in a late-January poll as Donald Trump climbed, but more votes went to Cruz on caucus night. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth place in November 2011. He shot up in the December poll to 15 percent, though he still lagged behind leaders Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. The late momentum carried through caucus night, when he was virtually tied with Romney for first place — and later declared the winner. Mike Huckabee surged in the late November 2007 Iowa poll from third place, with 12 percent, to first place, with 29 percent. The poll was published in early December, one month before Huckabee won the caucus with 34.4 percent of the vote. Barack Obama led the Iowa poll for the first time in November 2007, with 26 percent of the respondents marking him as their first choice. He widened his lead over opponents Hillary Clinton and John Edwards in the late-December poll, ultimately winning the caucuses by a nearly 8-point margin. John Kerry was third place in November 2003, behind Democratic leaders Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt. He leaped to first in a January 2004 poll, from 15 percent to 26 percent, then won the caucus.

These outcomes may not have as much in common as you’d think, aside from winning candidates finishing strong — which of course they did!

HRC won in a tough grind against one other well-organized candidate in a race that had steadily grown closer as Caucus Night approached (She led Bernie Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling averages by about 13 points on January 1, by only by 4 points on the eve of the vote). Cruz maintained an organization far superior to Trump’s, which made his close second in late polls enough for a win. Santorum spent more time in the state than any other 2012 GOP candidate, and benefited from hard-core ideological voters and the late collapse of support for paper tiger front-runner Newt Gingrich. Huckabee was perfectly positioned for Iowa’s social-conservative-heavy Republican activists, and was helped by ultimate nominee John McCain’s refusal to go all in. Barack Obama won by expanding the universe of caucusgoers to include a lot of young voters and independents. And John Kerry successfully did what Kamala Harris has tried to do this year, all but abandoning other states in order to pull off a late Iowa surge.

Nobody in either party has won Iowa without a solid organization and momentum, but the exact timing of when a candidate “surges” has varied. This question is of particular importance to Pete Buttigieg, whose surge in the November Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll resembles that of three recent winners: Cruz, Huckabee, and Obama.

But in that poll, 62 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to change candidates before Caucus Night. That should make Team Pete — and any subsequent Iowa front-runners — nervous."

Buttigieg and Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances?

AD

“They’re pissed off, because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote,” Booker said Wednesday in describing the mood of black voters.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer appeared at Thursday’s gathering of African American ministers, sponsored by Sharpton’s National Action Network, alongside Booker and Buttigieg. A few minutes away, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) hosted a Black Women Power Breakfast.

AD

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), taking the stage at a rally at Morehouse College, unveiled a plan to increase funding to historically black colleges and universities. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered a speech centered on the contributions of black women throughout history.

And several of the candidates headed to Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, to take part in a phone bank organized by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, one of the party’s African American stars.

AD

Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. Harris said it had been “misdirected” for Buttigieg, at the debate, to refer to his experience as a gay man during a discussion of racial issues; Buttigieg responded that he hadn’t been equating one experience to the other.

AD

Nina Turner, a co-chair of the Sanders campaign, took aim at Biden, playing down his service with President Barack Obama, which Biden often touts, especially to black audiences. Sanders “doesn’t believe that proximity to a black president gives one person more right to get the black vote than anybody else,” Turner said.

Buttigieg, as a 37-year-old white man in charge of a small Midwestern town, arguably faces more pressure than most to convince black voters that they can trust him. He has been gaining momentum in the Democratic race, but without African American support, his path to the nomination is challenging, if not impossible.

AD

In the most diverse field in presidential history, Buttigieg has less experience handling racial issues than many of his competitors, and he has made several missteps during the campaign. While his support has grown in Iowa and New Hampshire — where more than 90 percent of Democrats are white — he is struggling in South Carolina, with its sizable black population.

AD

A recent Quinnipiac University poll found Buttigieg receiving less than 1 percent support among likely black voters in the state.

At Sharpton’s event Thursday, Buttigieg said that as a gay man, he recognizes that his rights were expanded by the advocacy of others. That, he said, “is why I understand my obligation to do everything in my power, as a candidate and as a president, to bring about a sense of belonging and to put an end to systemic racism in this country before it puts an end to the entire American project.”

AD

Sharpton praised Buttigieg for reaching out to him on racial issues.

“He was open and candid. He called me — we didn’t call him,” Sharpton said. “I think that he has brought a very serious and thought-out vision into this campaign. Wherever it ends up, I think we will be hearing from Mayor Pete — or who knows, another title — for a long time.”

Warren, in her speech at Clark Atlanta University, one of the oldest HBCUs in the country, was joined by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), an African American lawmaker who has endorsed her. Warren was careful not to compare her experience with that of African Americans.

“As a white woman, I will never fully understand the discrimination, pain and harm that black Americans have experienced just because of the color of their skin,” Warren said. “I’m not here to tell you about a painful history that black Americans experienced and know all too well. I am here today for a different reason. I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of black history will not be lost.”

AD

The speech was disrupted several times by a group of more than 100 black activists pushing for school choice. “We value our children’s education,” said Sarah Carpenter of Memphis, a spokeswoman for the group. “If you don’t listen to us, we are going to raise our voice.”

Biden met Thursday with Democratic mayors of Southern cities, several of whom had written the candidates in September saying they needed to provide detailed plans for addressing these cities’ challenges if they hoped to get an endorsement.

Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, one of those who met with Biden, said the session went well but was just a start.

“I thought it was a good discussion, but I think a lot of us still want to have more discussions,” Stoney said. “This is hopefully the first of many talks we will be having with the vice president.”

AD

Stoney eventually plans to make an endorsement in the presidential race, and he said he would be guided heavily by how his constituents feel. For the moment, “I don’t see that sort of coalition coming together for Mayor Buttigieg,” Stoney said. “I think a lot of my constituents just don’t know him.”

AD

Biden, he said in contrast, “is a household name.”

Buttigieg is hardly the only candidate struggling to garner black support. But his rivals have begun seizing on that vulnerability to dispute Buttigieg’s suggestions that he can bridge the nation’s divides, with some questioning how electable he is without African American support.

The carefully chosen words Buttigieg uses to address those concerns have not overcome a range of problems and missteps during the campaign. In June, a white police officer in South Bend shot a black man, prompting protests against Buttigieg by black activists and forcing the mayor to leave the campaign trail for some time.

AD

AD

More recently, some black leaders in South Carolina expressed frustration when Buttigieg’s campaign listed them as endorsing his “Douglass plan” for racial justice, saying the campaign had overstated their level of support. And his campaign recently had to answer for using a stock photo of a Kenyan woman as part of its outreach to black voters.

Harris used that incident to argue during the debate that the Democratic nominee must be comfortable in diverse communities and suggested that some of her rivals were not.

“The question has to be, where you been? And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?” she said.

In a sign of their growing importance, racial issues underlined some of the debate’s sharpest exchanges. Booker, apparently referring to leaked reports of a Buttigieg campaign focus group on black voters, declared, “Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African American voters.”

AD

He added that he thought Biden must have been “high” to oppose marijuana legalization, given the effect of the drug war on minorities.

Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night.

Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — “because they know me, they know who I am.” He called himself “part of that Obama coalition.”

But Biden also mistakenly said he had been endorsed by the only African American woman ever elected to the Senate, a reference to former senator Carol Moseley Braun (D-Ill.). The second African American woman elected to the Senate — Harris — was standing a few feet away.

The Warren and Sanders campaigns have both acknowledged the need for further outreach to black communities, and they are relying on high-profile surrogates to help build credibility. Activist Phillip Agnew joined Turner, the Sanders co-chair, for a tour of HBCUs in the days leading up to the debate, and both appeared with Sanders at Morehouse on Thursday afternoon.

Turner often speaks of Sanders’s longtime involvement in the civil rights movement, and some of his supporters wear T-shirts featuring Sanders getting arrested at a protest while in college.

Birmingham, Ala., Mayor Randall Woodfin, one of those who met with Biden on Thursday, is not backing a particular candidate, but he said that Buttigieg has reached out to him and that the two might meet in Birmingham later this year.

Asked why Buttigieg has not connected with black voters, Woodfin said, “It’s not necessarily why black voters are not connecting with another candidate.” Rather, he said, “there is a candidate in the race that is appealing to black voters because there is a sense of already knowing — a relationship,” meaning Biden.

Fayetteville, N.C., Mayor Mitch Colvin, however, said there appears to be some skepticism in African American communities about Buttigieg.

The three other candidates who went on to win the caucus had not yet captured the lead in November, and sometimes trailed by large margins. Ted Cruz was in third place in October 2016, and John Kerry was in third in November 2004. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth in November 2011.

Of the candidates who have won the Iowa caucuses, two surged in December: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in December 2015 and former senator Rick Santorum in December 2011. If you, as I did, seemed to remember really late surges, you might be surprised that the only one matching that description was Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, who popped up in January 2004. In other words, if a candidate isn’t on the upswing now or by next month, the caucuses are unlikely to go well for them in February. At this point, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is plainly surging, as is Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), although at a much lower level.

The Register warns, “One factor that might make a late surge more difficult this cycle: The race is more stratified at this point than most. After Buttigieg comes a tight pack of [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren at 16% and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, both at 15%. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is at 6%. Everyone else is at 3% or under.”

You can point to ground organization, retail political skills and sufficient (not necessarily the most) money when handicapping the race. Another way to think of it, however, is to see the big hurdle voters would need to get over to choose a particular candidate.

For most voters, Buttigieg’s question is unanswerable at this point: Will he be able to win over African American voters in South Carolina and beyond? Voters can guess, but for contests that precede South Carolina (and Nevada, to some extent), they don’t have real evidence. He’s a work in progress with African American voters. As for Iowa voters, Buttigieg seems to be hitting a sweet spot and garnering big crowds and favorable local coverage. If we don’t see someone else break through in December, he could come in well ahead of some much better-known candidates.

For Biden, voters may want to know, Is he sharp enough? His core group of supporters hasn’t lost confidence, but he is having trouble satisfying skeptics, so his numbers are not increasing as yet. His chance for a surge is, therefore, low.

AD

AD

Warren’s problem is plain: Did she blow it with Medicare-for-all, veering too far left? Her implementation plan did not do much to calm nervous voters who want, more than anything, to beat President Trump. Moreover, her fierce on-message style and remarkable repetition may leave voters feeling like they saw-that-heard-that. She has been on the decline in Iowa for a few weeks. If she cannot figure out how to enliven her message and reassure voters obsessed with electability, the one-time front-runner may be disappointed with the results.

Sanders has been rising since his heart attack, but the question remains: Are there enough voters in the democratic-socialist camp for him to win? The conventional wisdom that Warren and Sanders divvy up a finite group of voters, preventing either from breaking out, may be correct in this case.

Klobuchar’s rise may be prompting Iowa voters to say to themselves, I like her, but can she really win this over all these bigger names? Voters there might well give her a first-round caucus vote to see if she can get over the 15-percent hump, and if she doesn’t, then decamp to another candidate for the second and final round. Showing these voters that she is pulling in big money and moving in polls — projecting confidence and progress — may be more critical for Klobuchar than for any other candidate.

AD

AD

There’s one more candidate who I would not count out until we get through December: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Voters may ask, Do I now understand who she is? Her ups and downs in the polls may have scared off voters who want to go with someone who can win, but along the way (judging from the Liberty and Justice dinner in Iowa and the most recent debate), she finally hit her stride, giving impassioned and confident performances that show her deep concern about some core issues. Voters who appreciate her rhetorical panache may be rooting for a general-election debate in which she pummels Trump. If I had to pick a late bloomer, along with Klobuchar, I would watch Harris.

Yet the Wisconsin survey showed modest but nonetheless perceptible shifts in the direction favoring Trump, on the question of whether he should be impeached and also in head-to-head matchups against leading Democratic presidential candidates. What makes the Wisconsin poll important is that it is a snapshot of a state that, more than any other in the country, could decide the 2020 election.

The Marquette poll found 40 percent of registered voters favoring impeachment of Trump and his removal from office, compared with 44 percent in October. At the same time, 53 percent oppose impeachment and removal, compared with 51 percent the previous month.

Statistically these are tiny-to-insignificant shifts, but the direction of the changes on this and other questions are consistent. From one month to the next, Republican attitudes hardened ever so slightly in favor of the president. As Charles Franklin, who directs the poll, put it, “A Republican rally around Trump is very strongly demonstrated in the poll.”

Meanwhile, Democratic attitudes, while still overwhelmingly in favor of impeachment and removal, softened slightly. Support for impeachment among independents went from a margin of 22 points to a margin of 11 points.

AD

AD

Franklin pointed to another set of findings showing that 42 percent of registered voters saying Trump did something “seriously wrong,” 9 percent saying he did something “wrong” and 38 percent saying he did “nothing wrong.” He called that “the even split we see in Wisconsin politics.”

The survey was conducted Nov. 13-17, which means it began the day of the testimony by William B. Taylor Jr., the senior diplomat in Ukraine, and concluded after testimony from Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was removed from her post last spring on orders from the president. The survey, with a margin of error was plus-or-minus 4.1 percentage points, was completed before this past week’s testimony, including that of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.

The results from Wisconsin also showed that, since the summer, the Democratic candidates have seen clear slippage in their support in hypothetical matchups with the president. Former vice president Joe Biden led the president by 51 percent to 42 percent in August. By October the margin was 50 percent to 44 percent. The latest poll flips the script. Trump now is ahead of Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent. The shift came primarily from movement among independents, either away from the former vice president to Trump or to a posture of saying they liked neither candidate.

AD

AD

Similar shifts have taken place in matchups between Trump and other potential Democratic challengers. Trump leads Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by 48 percent to 45 percent. He is ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) by 48 percent to 43 percent after being in a dead heat with her previously. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has risen among Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys, is trailing the president by 47 percent to 39 percent.

Franklin described the findings on Biden, Sanders and Warren as a shift from what was “a modest, mostly inside the margin of error” advantage for the Democrats to “a modest, mostly inside the margin of error” advantage for the president. He added, “That’s what you would expect in a battleground state.”

On the electoral college map, Wisconsin might be considered the quintessential battleground state heading into 2020. Its current political culture and partisan divisions are a microcosm of the nation. The divisions long predated Trump’s presidency but began to intensify during former Republican governor Scott Walker’s two terms in office and more so the past three years.

AD

AD

The 2000 presidential election saw the state go Democratic by two-tenths of a percentage point. The 2004 presidential elections tipped to the Democrats by four-tenths of a point. Barack Obama proved to be an anomaly, winning the state in 2008 by double-digits and in 2012 by about seven points. After Obama, Wisconsin reverted to its earlier status as a true battleground. Trump carried it by eight-tenths of a point, about 23,000 votes.

Trump’s current approval rating in the state, according to the Marquette poll, is 47 percent — higher than his national number and about the same as it was in the poll in October. Republicans are more unified behind him today than they were when he first ran for president.

Wisconsin has settled into a rough parity in partisan identification. Where once there was a modest Democratic advantage in party identification among voters, today it is basically even. It is also a state in flux politically, reshaped by the same forces and changing voter coalitions that are changing politics in other states.

AD

AD

The urban-rural divide has widened in recent years. Rural areas in Wisconsin, as in many other states, have become more Republican, especially during Trump’s presidency. Meanwhile, Democrats have made gains in suburban counties in Wisconsin that once voted strongly Republican.

Counties around Milwaukee still favor Republicans but not by the margins of the past, as evidenced by the midterm election returns in 2018. Walker did worse in his home areas in southeast Wisconsin in 2018 than in his previous campaigns but better in rural areas in the northwest. The slippage in suburban areas has become a cause for concern among some Republican strategists who work the state regularly.

Wisconsin is one of three states of critical importance in 2020, the others being Michigan and Pennsylvania. All three went for Trump after consistently supporting Democratic nominees in a string of elections. If nothing else changes on the electoral map, which is to say if Trump again wins Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa, Democrats need the three northern states to capture the presidency or find substitutes elsewhere.

AD

AD

Of those three, Wisconsin could be the most difficult to convert. All three states now have Democratic governors, but Wisconsin’s Tony Evers won in 2018 by a percentage point over Walker; Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf both won by comfortable margins. Wisconsin’s population is whiter than the other two. Wisconsin’s union infrastructure, a valuable source of voter mobilization help, has deteriorated, thanks to Walker’s assault on public employee unions.

Democrats in Congress are moving forward to impeach the president and leaders have said that constitutional prerogatives, not political considerations, should shape the proceedings. But there will be political fallout, which is why attitudes from Wisconsin bear watching. Much can change in the weeks and months ahead, but the modest shifts in the past month are a reminder to Democrats that public opinion is not currently moving in their direction.

THE KEY

A frontal assault on claims by President Trump and Republicans that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election was welcome news to security researchers.

Fiona Hill, a former member of Trump's National Security Council, insisted in yesterday's impeachment hearing that such allegations not only undermine U.S. intelligence agencies' universal conclusion that Russia was responsible but play right into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,” Hill said. “This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”

This was a memorable clapback after a week of careful testimony by diplomats and a slew of conspiracy theories elevated by Republicans on the committee.

“It’s going to be incredibly difficult to prepare for 2020, or to deter activity in 2020, if we’re not clear about what happened in 2016,” John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, told me.

“[Russian interference] was agreed to by just about every intelligence agency and cybersecurity company out there. Any alternative story that hasn’t been vetted by serious organizations just muddies the waters.”

Hill also suggested that lawmakers' statements might make it easier for the Kremlin to strike again. “Right now, Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We are running out of time to stop them,” she said. “In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically derivative falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.”

In fact, as my colleague Philip Bump points out, ""we don’t need to take Hill’s word for it that Russia embraces the Ukraine-did-it-too narrative being deployed by Trump’s allies. [Putin] spoke at an event in Moscow on Wednesday and addressed the idea directly.""

“Thank God,” Putin said, “no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore. Now they’re accusing Ukraine.”

Hill's language was designed to send a message to politicians about the damage they were doing to the country. “These fictions are harmful, even if they're deployed for purely domestic political purposes,” she said. “President Putin and the Russian security services operate like a super PAC. They deploy millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives. When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each other, degrade our institutions and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy.”

Her comments drew cheers from Democratic lawmakers.

From House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.):

This morning, Fiona Hill, an expert on Russian & Eurasian affairs, will testify & dispel the GOP’s false claims that Ukraine – not Russia – interfered in our election. The GOP must stop peddling conspiracy theories as a way to blindly defend POTUS & #DefendOurDemocray. https://t.co/wDdam3HWVt — Steny Hoyer (@LeaderHoyer) November 21, 2019

From 2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.):

Republicans shot back, however, saying Hill was misstating their arguments because they haven’t explicitly denied Russia interfered in 2016.

“My Democratic colleagues attempting to manipulate media coverage with untruthful statements about our efforts to combat Russian interference reeks of political desperation. Not one Republican on the Committee has denied Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 election,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) tweeted.

The top Republican on the commitee, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who suggested specifically this week that Ukraine acted inappropriately in the 2016 election, said Republicans were only arguing that perhaps another country did, too. (As my colleague Aaron Blake points out, ""Trump, it bears noting, has suggested it was really only Ukraine."")

Addressing Hill's criticisms, Nunes said, ""it is entirely possible for two separate nations to engage in election meddling at the same time. And Republicans believe we should take meddling seriously by all foreign countries, regardless of which campaign is the target.”

""Later in the hearing, though, Hill offered an extensive response to that idea, arguing Ukraine’s actions were simply not at all comparable to what Russia did, given Russia’s was an extensive, top-down effort that included a misinformation campaign,"" Blake writes. ""And indeed, she said Ukraine’s actions weren’t terribly dissimilar from officials in other countries who assumed Hillary Clinton would win the election and that they could criticize Trump.""

PINGED: China hawks in the Senate are demanding the administration suspend a new program granting licenses for U.S. firms to sell less-risky components to the Chinese telecom firm Huawei until Congress gets a briefing on the national security implications, my colleague Jeanne Whalen reports.

The letter from a bipartisan group of 15 senators also asks for a warning before the Commerce Department issues any additional licenses. And they criticize the administration for continuing to delay a blanket ban on sales to Huawei over Chinese spying concerns.

“National security experts widely agree that Chinese companies cooperate heavily with the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government is thought to exercise considerable influence over Huawei, in particular,” the letter led by Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) states.

The licenses “will allow Huawei to fully resume its engagement with certain U.S. firms without an adequate assessment of the risks to national security,” they write.

The Commerce Department has said the licenses it approved this week were for “limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Huawei has consistently denied aiding Chinese government spying.

PATCHED: Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are just a few of the nations emerging as major players in a cyberthreat space once dominated by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, a new report from the Aspen Institute's cyber and technology program finds. China, Russia, North Korea and Iran traditionally get the most attention for offensive cyber operations, but other nations are starting to catch up.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have also managed to increase their offensive hacking capabilities by employing private firms such as U.S.-based CyberPoint, the Israeli NSO Group, and other hackers for hire to compete for regional power and silence dissidents. The NSO Group recently came under fire for hacking into the WhatsApp accounts of human rights activists and journalists. Vietnam, meanwhile, has started to copy China's playbook by using state-sponsored hackers typically to target corporate competitors in the region. Romania, by contrast, has served as a safe haven for hackers. Brazilian hacking remains uniquely driven by internal motives, including profit-seeking by domestic crime groups and “hacktivists” trying to expose government corruption.

PWNED: Mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign has an unusual strategy to get ahead of the possibility bad actors could manipulate audio and video of him: nonstop surveillance.

“We keep the mayor in front of a camera basically all his waking hours,” the campaign's chief security officer Mick Baccio told an audience at the Cyberwarcon outside Washington yesterday. “So if there is that doctored video we have the original to combat it.”

Manipulated video content has been a concern for politicians since a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), slowed down to make her appear drunk, went viral this summer. Even after the video was debunked, it continued to spread on Facebook and other platforms. The viral nature of the manipulated video is one reason that keeping a video record may not be enough to combat the problem, Foreign Policy Research Institute research fellow Clint Watts says.

“The people that tend to believe these things are so wrapped up in political bias, you could show them the real video later and they still might not believe it,” he says.

Having real content archived or easily accessible on social media does allow the campaign to react more quickly to combat the disinformation, Watts says. “It does give them a counter weapon … but it’s not a silver bullet either,” he says.

Watts says that Buttigieg and other candidates should push for a partnership between the government and social media companies to create a verification process designating the time, date and origin of digital content to help users discern which content is authentic.

CHAT ROOM

Even outside the impeachment hearings, it has been hard for the cybersecurity world to avoid the ongoing attention to a debunked conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee faked a 2016 hack by Russia and hid a server full of emails somewhere in Ukraine.

Bloomberg News's William Turton detailed how the conspiracy theory followed CrowdStrike, which has been accused of helping with the hidden server, into a security conference:

“The field will narrow, and there’s going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don’t agree with and you don’t find them completely inspiring the way you’d like, I don’t care,” Obama said Thursday. “Because the choice is so stark and the stakes are so high that you cannot afford to be ambivalent in this race.”

“I’m always suspicious of purity tests during elections,” Obama said, according to the New York Times. “Because you know what? The country’s complicated.”

The former president’s remarks came at a private fundraiser in the town of Los Altos Hills, near San Jose, hosted by physician and political donor Karla Jurvetson, where attendees paid up to $355,000 to attend, Recode reported.

In recent weeks, Obama has begun to emerge from the sidelines of the Democratic primary with headline-generating remarks about the 2020 race. His message to Democrats has hit the same notes throughout: Don’t stress too much, be mindful of losing touch with voters, and stay focused on the goal of beating Trump.

Obama’s engagement coincides with rising panic among some party figures that the liberal candidates are dragging the conversation too far to the left and that a more centrist, unifying approach will be required to defeat Trump next November.

Moderate Democratic candidates have attempted to seize their moment during a conversation dominated so far by liberal policies espoused by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.). At Wednesday night’s Democratic debate, candidates such as Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), along with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, elbowed their way to the fore with calls for “unity” and attacks on proposals to overhaul the health-care system with Medicare-for-all.

Meanwhile, two additional candidates with a centrist approach have attempted to join the fray: Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick entered the primary last week, and former New York mayor and billionaire Mike Bloomberg filed candidate paperwork on Thursday after initially ruling out a run.

Obama has so far declined to endorse in the 2020 Democratic primary, despite the fact that his former vice president, Joe Biden, is running, and Obama has also refrained from criticizing any candidate by name. But he has shared his general thoughts that to beat Trump, Democrats must be “bold in our vision” while staying “rooted in reality” so as not to turn away more-moderate voters.

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,” Obama said at a Nov. 15 meeting of the Democracy Alliance in Washington. “They like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn’t think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it’s important for us not to lose sight of that.

“My point is that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision,” he said Nov. 15, “we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party.”

THE BIG IDEA: “Godfather II” is the Francis Ford Coppola movie that’s been in the news lately. Roger Stone was convicted Nov. 15 of tampering with a witness and lying to Congress about his efforts to learn of hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election. An FBI agent testified at trial that President Trump’s longtime friend and former political strategist twice told an associate to do a “Frank Pentangeli” ahead of a deposition two years ago to avoid contradicting what Stone had previously told the House Intelligence Committee.

In that film, Pentangeli is about to begin his testimony during a congressional hearing into the Corleone organized crime family when Michael Corleone ominously enters the room with Pentangeli’s brother. Suddenly, Pentangeli clams up. “I don’t know nothin’ about that,” he insists. The judge in the Stone case rejected a request from prosecutors to play this clip at trial, accepting an argument from Stone’s lawyers that doing so could prejudice the jurors.

-- Fiona Hill’s epiphany that Gordon Sondland was running a “domestic political errand” for Trump conjured the climax of another Coppola classic. In “Apocalypse Now,” Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) finally tracks down Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) after his journey into the heart of Vietnam’s darkness.

“They told me that you had gone totally insane and that your methods were unsound,” Willard says.

Kurtz asks: “Are you an assassin?”

“I’m a soldier,” Willard answers.

“You’re neither,” replies Kurtz. “You’re an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill.”

-- Hill’s testimony on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee was almost as cinematic, and at times it felt like something that Coppola himself, now 80, might have directed. The former senior official on the National Security Council recalled confronting Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on June 18. “I actually said to him, ‘Who put you in charge of Ukraine?’ … I’ll admit I was a bit rude. And that’s when he told me, ‘The president.’ And that shut me up,” Hill said.

“I had not put my finger on that at the moment,” she continued, “but I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn’t fully coordinating. And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, ‘Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up.’ And here we are.”

Hill said that she later chastised Sondland for not coordinating with her, and he responded that he already was briefing Trump himself, plus acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-national security adviser John Bolton. “Who else,” Hill said Sondland asked her, “do I have to deal with?”

Hill said she finally realized while watching Sondland’s televised testimony on Wednesday that he was “absolutely right.”

“He wasn’t coordinating with us because we weren’t doing the same thing that he was doing,” Hill said. “He was being involved in a domestic political errand. And we were being involved in national security foreign policy.”

She testified that Bolton saw what was being “cooked up” as a “drug deal” and described Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, as a “hand grenade” who was going to “blow everyone up.”

Hill, with her British coal-miner daughter’s accent, exuded a no-nonsense vibe. The White House instructed her not to appear, but she complied with the House’s subpoena and came anyway. She was not deterred by criticism from Trump allies or death threats and doxing. The 54-year-old confirmed an anecdote of her steeliness from a New York Times profile that, when she was 11 years old, a boy set her pigtails on fire while she was taking a test — and she snuffed out the fire with her hands and finished the exam. “It is a true story,” Hill said, adding that there were “unfortunate consequences.”

“Afterward, my mother gave me a bowl haircut,” Hill lamented. “So, for the school photograph later in that week, I looked like Richard III.”

-- This whole mess stems, at least in part, from Trump’s expansive view of presidential powers. Set aside, for a moment, the growing body of evidence that Trump sought to coerce the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, his 2020 challenger, by holding up nearly $400 million in security assistance that had been approved by Congress and putting off a White House meeting with the country’s new president. Table the testimony that Trump told public officials to go “talk with Rudy,” his personal lawyer, to understand what he wanted from Ukraine, and unanswered questions about why Trump purportedly empowered Sondland to get involved in Ukraine policy, despite Ukraine not being part of the European Union. Look past the question of whether the president deserves to be impeached, an inherently political question.

Listen to Trump talk about this donnybrook specifically and the presidency generally, however, and it’s not at all clear that he thinks anything he’s accused of would have been inappropriate — if he did it. That’s not exculpatory, but it speaks volumes about his view of the presidency and raises a different set of questions about his fitness for the office.

Lawmakers asked the procession of witnesses this week whether the president’s purported behavior was inappropriate. They’ve asked, hypothetically, whether it’s okay for a governor to not fund a law enforcement agency if it doesn’t investigate an opponent. Even the witnesses called by Republicans agreed that this would be wrong.

Trump denies wrongdoing — as he always does — but it's unclear whether he thinks it's morally or legally problematic to seek foreign help for domestic political purposes. That might explain why he keeps describing as “perfect” the rough transcript of his July 25 call in which he asked for “a favor” as soon as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky broached his government’s desire to buy Javelin antitank missiles to fend off the Russian-backed separatists.

-- Trump likes to say he has an “absolute right” as president to do what he wants, whether it’s disclosing highly classified intelligence to Russian adversaries in the Oval Office, firing the FBI director and even pardoning himself. There are many more examples of Trump using this formulation and insisting that he has an “absolute right” to do what he wants as president.

The president has made increasingly provocative assertions of his own power since taking office almost three years ago. “Article II allows me to do whatever I want,” Trump said this summer. The president was making the point during an interview with ABC News that he could have fired Bob Mueller, who prepared the case against Stone, if he wanted to do so. He’s made variations of this statement several times in just the past few months, from a gaggle on the White House lawn to an 80-minute speech at a conference for pro-Trump students. “I have the right to do whatever I want as president,” Trump told the kids.

-- This, of course, is not true. Article II enumerates several specific powers for the president but by no means gives him total power. In fact, the impeachment clause is in Section Four of Article II. Removing a president for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors” is literally, by definition, a constitutional act.

During an appearance on Fox News two years ago, Trump was asked why he had left unfilled so many key political appointments at the State Department. “Let me tell you, the one that matters is me,” he replied. “I’m the only one that matters. Because when it comes to it, that’s what the policy is going to be. We don’t need all the people that they want.”

-- It’s not just Ukraine. Trump often mixes, or at least conflates, his private interests with the national interest. He’s shown no compunction about doing so. Trump pushed aides to choose his own resort in Doral, Fla., to host next year’s Group of Seven summit — and then backed off in the face of public backlash. Vice President Pence stayed at a Trump-owned property in Ireland that was hours away from his official meetings in Dublin because the president encouraged him to do so. The Air Force has scheduled up to 40 overnight stays at Trump’s property in Turnberry, Scotland.

-- Consider these three stories that have broken in the past 24 hours:

1) Trump is essentially charging the Secret Service to protect him. The U.S. Secret Service paid more than $250,000 to the president’s private businesses in just the first five months of his presidency — paying Trump’s company an average of nearly $2,000 per day. These new numbers come from credit card receipts obtained by the group Property of the People after an open-records lawsuit and detail additional revenue that Trump has taken from U.S. taxpayers. “The president has set up an extraordinary arrangement: He kept ownership of his businesses — and then visited them repeatedly, bringing along aides and security officials, and charging the government for what they bought,” David Fahrenthold, Jonathan O'Connell and Joshua Partlow report. “The documents do not give much detail about the spending. … The White House declined to comment. … The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. … A Secret Service spokeswoman declined to comment. …

“Previously, other records have shown that taxpayers covered the cost of Trump aides staying in the guest suites at Mar-a-Lago, at $546 per night. Taxpayers also paid for a $1,000 liquor tab rung up by Trump aides in a Mar-a-Lago bar. The Secret Service records released Thursday cover only the first five months of Trump’s term, during which he made 21 visits to Trump properties … Since then, Trump has made more than 100 additional visits to his properties. The Secret Service has not released records about those visits.”

2) The foreign emoluments clause gets most of the attention, but there’s also a domestic emoluments clause that legal experts say Trump may have violated. The president’s businesses have taken taxpayer money from governors seeking to curry favor with the president. The latest example: Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin stayed at Trump’s hotel when he came to Washington in January for two nights. Records obtained by The Post show that Kentucky taxpayers initially footed the $686 bill.

“Although Kentucky’s Republican Party reimbursed the state for Bevin’s stay two months later, the transaction may still run afoul of an anti-corruption provision of the Constitution,” O’Connell and Fahrenthold note. “In two cases wending their way through federal court, plaintiffs have alleged that Trump — by retaining his financial interest in his companies and doing business with state governments — has violated the Constitution’s domestic emoluments clause.

“A central example cited by plaintiffs has been visits to the hotel by … Republican Paul LePage, while he was governor of Maine. … Other guests have acknowledged staying at the hotel as a way of trying to curry favor with the president. … Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit are scheduled to hear arguments in the case Dec. 12 in Richmond, and legal experts expect that because no court has ever previously ruled on the emoluments provisions, the case is likely to reach the Supreme Court.”

3) A far-right group that believes Islamists are infiltrating the U.S. government will hold a banquet tomorrow at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club. Fahrenthold reports: “The group, the Center for Security Policy, has also spread the false idea that former president Barack Obama is a Muslim and alleged that mainstream Muslim organizations in the United States are secretly agents of anti-American jihad. The group has rented a ballroom for Saturday at Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla., for its annual Freedom Flame Award Dinner. The 200-person event, named after the group’s flaming-torch symbol, previously was held in New York City and Washington. … At this gala, a conservative group that wants to shape Trump’s public policy will also become his private customer. The permit says the Center for Security Policy event will cost $53,000.”

-- To channel a mentality Trump expressed in another context: When you’re a president, they let you do it.

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- No additional Intelligence Committee hearings are scheduled, though that can change if they can lock down additional witnesses. Committee staffers plan to release a report summarizing their findings based on the evidence that’s been presented during the hearings. Then the House Judiciary Committee will draft articles of impeachment, as soon as the week after Thanksgiving. (Karoun Demirjian, Elise Viebeck, Rosalind S. Helderman and Matt Zapotosky)

-- Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), the most moderate member on the Intelligence Committee, who is retiring and formerly served in the CIA, said as yesterday’s hearing wrapped up that what the president did was clearly “inappropriate” but not impeachable. If Hurd is toeing the line, it’s hard to see many — or any — House GOP defections.

-- The hearings have cemented House Democrats’ determination to proceed with impeachment. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report that the hearings have galvanized rank-and-file members and put the House on a clear trajectory toward impeachment: “‘The picture has been painted,’ said Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.). ‘This is a president who clearly tried to bribe a foreign government to investigate his opponent. I mean, and it’s almost like everyone in the room understands that. But some [Republicans] are arguing that the burden of proof is so high that it can’t be met.’ Some Democrats — including those holding some of the most vulnerable seats — said they were waiting to consider all the evidence before coming to a conclusion, but they also declined to identify any major gaps in evidence that they would want to see filled before a vote.”

-- A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday afternoon to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks. Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report: “The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, … the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely. …

“Even a two-week trial could run counter to what Trump has expressed privately. The president is ‘miserable’ about the impeachment inquiry and has pushed to dismiss the proceedings right away. … Still, administration officials are readying all options to present them to Trump, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone is preparing to mount a full defense of the president for an impeachment trial. … ‘I don’t want them to believe there’s an ability to dismiss the case before it’s heard,’ said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who was among the group of half a dozen GOP senators who met Thursday with White House officials to begin mapping out a trial strategy. ‘I think most everybody agreed, there’s not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call the case.’

“In addition to Graham, the meeting Thursday included Republican Sens. Mike Lee (Utah), Ron Johnson (Wis.), John Neely Kennedy (La.), Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Tom Cotton (Ark.), along with Cipollone; acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; and counselor Kellyanne Conway … Ultimately, Trump will make the final call on trial strategy, a senior administration official said.”

-- Graham, in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Pompeo to provide documents related to the Bidens, Ukraine and Burisma. Colby Itkowitz reports: “Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Joe Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation. Graham [said] in late October that he was under intense pressure to launch an investigation into Biden by Trump and his allies. But he said he would not ‘turn the Senate into a circus’ and would instead focus his committee’s work on the investigation into the Justice Department’s launch of the Russia investigation.” Apparently he's changed his mind after receiving pressure from the White House.

-- No precedent shields Trump from releasing his financial records, the top lawyer for the House argued in a filing with the Supreme Court. Robert Barnes reports: “House General Counsel Doug N. Letter said in a brief that the court’s precedents involving Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton make clear that the chief executive enjoys no special privilege to be free from investigation or legal action. The Supreme Court ‘has established that even a private citizen may invoke the courts’ subpoena power against the president in appropriate cases,’ the brief states. ‘In light of that settled law, it would hardly make sense to say that Congress, a coordinate branch, cannot use its own subpoena power in a matter involving the president.’” Letter added: ‘Each day of delay harms Congress by depriving it of important information it needs to carry out its constitutional responsibilities.”

-- The Justice Department inspector general found evidence that an FBI employee may have altered a document connected to court-approved surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser. Devlin Barrett, Ellen Nakashima and Matt Zapotosky report: Inspector General Michael Horowitz “concluded that the conduct did not affect the overall validity of the surveillance application. … The person under scrutiny has not been identified but is a low-level FBI lawyer who has since been forced out of the FBI. … The employee was forced out of the FBI after the incident was discovered, two U.S. officials said. Horowitz found that the employee erroneously indicated he had documentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis for the application. He then altered an email to back up that erroneous claim, they said.

“That conduct did not alter Horowitz’s finding that the surveillance application of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page had a proper legal and factual basis, the officials said. … Separately, Attorney General William P. Barr tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham to explore the origins of the FBI probe and U.S. intelligence agency activities aimed at the Trump campaign, and Durham is expected to pursue the allegation surrounding the altered document to see whether it constitutes a crime. ... Durham’s work is expected to continue well after publication of the inspector general’s report.”

-- Prosecutors behind an investigation into the Trump Organization have zeroed in on Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer, and his connection to the hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels. From ProPublica: “Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, or SDNY, contended that the Trump Organization had improperly booked reimbursements for the hush-money scheme as 'legal expenses,' with the aid of sham invoices. They granted legal immunity to Weisselberg and later closed their 18-month investigation with the guilty plea of one Trump associate, Michael Cohen. But Weisselberg’s immunity deal applied only to federal proceedings. Now [Cyrus] Vance’s state grand jury is examining whether Weisselberg, among others — and even the Trump Organization — should face state criminal charges for falsification of business records, according to a source familiar with the investigation. … Neither the president nor his sons appear to be in Vance’s crosshairs at this point in the investigation, which is at an early stage, according to the source familiar with the investigation. But, the source added, New York prosecutors are far from ruling that out.”

-- A new book written by Glenn Simpson and his partner Peter Fritsch, two operatives at Fusion GPS whose lives were upended by their role in the dissemination of the Steele dossier, vigorously defends their work. From the Atlantic: “Accustomed to writing the story, the two ex-journalists, Simpson and Fritsch, had now become one. Since the dossier’s publication, they have been sued and hauled before Congress. They’ve had company bank records examined by Republican-controlled congressional committees and been targets of sustained attacks by the opinion writers at their old newspaper [the Wall Street Journal]. They feared the firm would be bankrupted by legal fees, and they worried for their safety. That wasn’t paranoia: Trump used his Twitter feed to repeatedly attack the firm by name and discredit the dossier. …

“Some important assertions in the dossier remain unconfirmed. No pee tape has surfaced, nor is there any evidence that [Cohen] traveled to Prague during the 2016 campaign to meet with Kremlin officials and discuss payments to hackers, as the dossier alleged. Still, Simpson and Fritsch argue that the report was accurate in its warnings about Trump’s conduct and Russia’s willingness to undermine Western democracies. They note that the dossier mentioned how Russia had sought to woo Trump through real-estate deals. Trump long denied that he had any business dealings in Russia, though evidence emerged last year that Cohen had been talking with Russian figures about a Trump real-estate deal in Moscow deep into the 2016 campaign. 'After three years of investigations, a fair assessment of the memos would conclude that many of the allegations in the dossier have been borne out,' the authors write in the book’s epilogue. 'Some proved remarkably prescient. Other details remain stubbornly unconfirmed, while a handful now appear to be doubtful, though not yet disproven.'”

-- Hill also testified that conspiracy theories are as effective at advancing Russia’s agenda as they are at dividing Americans. Greg Miller reports: “‘Our nation is being torn apart,’ she said. ‘Truth is questioned.’ … Trump’s allies … [have] used the impeachment hearings to advance murkier claims that Ukraine sought to undermine Trump in the 2016 election. Hill treated such claims with scorn. ‘I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine — not Russia — attacked us in 2016,’ she said.”

-- In Ukraine, the U.S. impeachment inquiry has been met with a big yawn. Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern are on the ground: “Ukrainian leaders have done their best to stay out of it, seeing only peril in commenting for fear that Democrats or Republicans could use them as cudgels in their partisan brawl. Local media is filled with domestic intrigue about leaked corruption-related recordings, uncertain prospects for peace in eastern Ukraine and questions about where Ukraine’s comedian-turned-president … is taking the nation. And in the capital, Kyiv, ordinary citizens are far more focused on their own pocketbook concerns. … Protesters plan to mount a rally Thursday evening to press Zelensky to hold firm against Russia in his effort to bring peace to eastern Ukraine — the issue that is probably the biggest and most divisive in the country right now.”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULDN’T BE OVERSHADOWED:

-- Pentagon officials were mostly kept out of the loop as outsiders lobbied Trump for war crime pardons. Dan Lamothe and Josh Dawsey report: “Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, who faced a murder trial next year in the 2010 death of a suspected Taliban bombmaker, said he expected the call to be quick. But Trump talked to him for nearly 15 minutes, asking questions about his plans for the future and the Pentagon’s application of military justice. ‘I’m paraphrasing here, but he asked, ‘Did you feel like you were going to get a fair shake or that it was slanted or biased against you?’’ Golsteyn said in an interview. ‘I told him, ‘Sir, it was quite clear that the outcome was fixed.’ And he said, ‘Yeah, that was my thought, as well.’’ Trump’s intervention in the cases prompted a sharp backlash from some veterans and legal experts, who said that it will undermine the military justice system and weaken U.S. credibility abroad. But on Thursday, Trump weighed in again, saying in a tweet that he will not allow one of the service members [Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher] to be ejected from the Navy SEALs. Rear Adm. Charles Brown, the Navy’s top spokesman, said in a statement Thursday night that the service is aware of the president’s tweet and awaiting further guidance.

“How Trump came to believe that the Pentagon could not handle the cases fairly, and ultimately issue the pardons, reflects his tendency to accept the advice of people outside his administration. The president mostly left defense officials out of his discussions about the issue until a few weeks ago and told his top advisers that his supporters would back the move, according to five officials familiar with the situation. Instead, the officials said, Trump discussed the issue with other people in his orbit, including Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality who highlighted the cases on his show and described the service members as heroes facing malicious prosecution. Trump called Hegseth numerous times to discuss the issue and told others about the conversations, according to one current and one former administration official.”

-- Trump made an unannounced visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to receive the remains of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Toluse Olorunnipa reports: “David Knadle and Kirk Fuchigami Jr., who each held the rank of chief warrant officer 2, were killed Wednesday in a helicopter crash … Both men are Bronze Star recipients and both deployed to Afghanistan in October. … Trump traveled to Dover with first lady Melania Trump; Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and White House aides. After meeting with the families of the fallen soldiers, Trump stood silently and saluted as the men’s remains were carried by a group of service members and transferred into a waiting van. The actor Jon Voight, whom Trump awarded the National Medal of the Arts on Thursday, also attended the dignified transfer ceremony. Voight told reporters he did not meet with family members of the fallen soldiers. He said Trump invited him to attend the ceremony.”

-- The Department of Veterans Affairs put “millions of people at risk of identity theft” by not deleting personally identifying information from records released while responding to a request for documents. Eric Yoder reports: “That information included names and Social Security numbers of people such as other military personnel and doctors who had treated the veteran, said an inspector general report issued last week. The report said people whose names were in the records were not informed that their information had been released, ‘meaning individuals at risk of identity theft might not be aware of that risk.’ Under a policy that started in May 2016, the Veterans Benefits Administration, a sub-agency of VA, stopped redacting personal information on other people from those files, which can be requested under the Privacy Act.”

-- A government shutdown has been averted — for now. Erica Werner reports: “Trump signed a short-term spending bill Thursday to keep the government open through late December, staving off a shutdown that would have begun at midnight. Trump’s signature on the stopgap spending bill came following Senate passage of the legislation on a bipartisan 74-to-20 vote. The House passed it earlier in the week in the midst of public impeachment hearings. … The bill extends government funding through Dec. 20, setting up a fight over money for Trump’s border wall that could happen around the same time the House is voting on articles of impeachment. ... It is the second stopgap spending bill Congress has been forced to pass to keep the lights on in government for the 2020 budget year that began Oct. 1. … Trump and Senate Republicans want $5 billion for the wall, but House Democrats included no such money at all in the spending bills they passed. It remains unclear where a compromise might lie. By extending funding through Dec. 20, lawmakers hope to give themselves time to come up with a deal on that issue and others that would allow them to pass full-year bills to fund the government for the rest of the budget year that ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- White House officials will present Trump with a plan to crack down on homelessness in California as soon as next week, and a top federal housing official who was appointed during the Obama years has been ousted. Jeff Stein, Josh Dawsey and Tracy Jan report: ""Trump will be able to select ideas for how to address the growing homeless problem in several major cities. One person involved in deliberations said the administration’s plans are likely to target homelessness in Los Angeles and could include repurposing existing federal property, but the exact set of policy options to be presented to the president could not be learned. … The accelerating plans follow Trump’s demands to aides over the summer to do something about the homeless crisis in cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. …

“Rumors of the crackdown have generated concern among career officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as national housing experts, who worry Trump is trying to exploit the issue for political gain while offering solutions that could make the problem worse. Those fears flared up again when Matthew Doherty, who until Friday served as executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, was told ‘the administration no longer wishes to have me,’ according to an email Doherty sent to colleagues outside the government. On Tuesday, career staff at HUD were told at an internal meeting that Doherty was not willing to compromise his principles and follow the Trump administration’s lead on homelessness policy, according to a person who attended the meeting.”

-- Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has weakened safety rules dictating how companies need to store dangerous chemicals. The rules were enacted in the wake of a 2013 explosion in West, Tex., that killed 15. Juliet Eilperin reports: “Under the new standards, companies will not have to provide public access to information about what kinds of chemicals are stored on their sites. They also will not have to undertake several measures aimed at preventing accidents, such as analyzing safer technology and procedures, conducting a ‘root-cause analysis’ after a major chemical release or obtaining a third-party audit when an accident has occurred. In a statement, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the revised ‘Risk Management Program’ rule addresses concerns raised by security experts, who feared that releasing the location of the country’s chemical stores could provide a road map for terrorists, as well as others.”

-- The Trump administration unveiled a plan that could allow oil drilling on over three-quarters of the nation’s largest piece of unprotected wilderness, overhauling a 2013 plan that limited development on the Alaskan reserve. Eilperin reports: “The 23-million acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which is roughly the size of Indiana, has attracted relatively little public attention compared with the neighboring Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But it ranks as one of the most ecologically valuable and promising oil prospects in the country. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management announced it is considering four possible options for the reserve, from slightly scaling back the 11.7 million acres eligible for development to expanding the leasing area to 18.3 million acres. The Obama administration had put half of the reserve off limits to development six years ago, on the grounds that specific areas provided crucial habitat for hundreds of thousands of migrating birds and tens of thousands of caribou. But it is also the site of significant oil deposits, and recent findings suggest that it could hold as much as 8.7 billion barrels in undiscovered oil.”

President Trump pats Justice Anthony Kennedy on the back after last October's swearing-in ceremony for Brett Kavanaugh. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

-- Anthony Kennedy suggested Brett Kavanaugh as his replacement to Trump, according to a new book by deputy editorial page editor Ruth Marcus. Kennedy had a secret meeting with the president at the White House after a Rose Garden ceremony in April 2017 to swear in Neil Gorsuch, who like Kavanaugh was a former law clerk. Kennedy requested the private moment, Marcus reports, and told Trump that Kavanaugh should be on his shortlist. “The justice’s message to the president was as consequential as it was straightforward, and it was a remarkable insertion by a sitting justice into the distinctly presidential act of judge picking,” Marcus writes in “Supreme Ambition: Brett Kavanaugh and the Conservative Takeover.” Kennedy announced his retirement 14 months later — after Kavanaugh’s name was added to Trump’s public list by Don McGahn, Robert Barnes notes. “Marcus’s book, to be published Dec. 3, is at least the fifth to examine Kavanaugh’s nomination and confirmation. It does not attempt to prove or undermine the allegations against him …

“White House adviser Kellyanne Conway reported to Trump and her colleagues [in the spring of 2017] that she had spoken with Kennedy’s son Gregory Kennedy at the annual white-tie Alfalfa Club dinner. No one was happier about the outcome of the election than his father, Gregory Kennedy said, according to the book. … Marcus writes he wanted to be replaced by another Republican. ‘That’s good to know,’ Conway replied, according to the book. ‘That happiness has consequences.’ (In a footnote, Marcus says that Gregory Kennedy denied in an email this summer that he talked to Conway that night about his father.) … When Kennedy met with Trump on June 28, 2018, to say he was retiring, Kennedy suggested Kavanaugh as his replacement, Marcus reports …

“She quotes an anonymous White House official as saying he ‘had the most intense lobbying campaign inside and outside the White House.’ … She writes that a ‘delegation’ of former Kavanaugh clerks made a presentation to the influential Leonard A. Leo of the Federalist Society to try to persuade him that Kavanaugh was sufficiently conservative. Still, the nomination was not in the bag. Leo continued to advocate for a more conservative candidate, although his well-publicized role in the process annoyed Trump, the book says. ‘That [expletive] Leonard Leo yapping his mouth,’ the book quotes Trump as telling an adviser after seeing Leo on television. ‘Everybody should just keep quiet. I make the decisions here.’”

-- Former Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh pleaded guilty to fraud-and-tax-evasion conspiracies to illegally hide profits from sales of her children’s books to enhance her political and personal fortunes. Pugh’s acknowledgment of guilt in four of the 11 charges filed against her came during a court hearing in downtown Baltimore, the city the disgraced 69-year-old once led. Peter Hermann, Lynh Bui and Ann E. Marimow report: “Authorities in April searched Baltimore City Hall, Pugh’s homes and a nonprofit organization tied to her, seeking financial documents and other information related to almost $800,000 she allegedly was paid for her self-published books. … Most of the books in Pugh’s transactions were marketed and sold directly to nonprofit organizations and foundations, many of which did business or tried to get business with the state and city of Baltimore. … In all, court records show, Pugh took purchase orders for roughly 124,000 books but had printers produce only 63,210. ...

“Pugh’s hearing surfaced new details about at least one book purchaser, who Pugh said in her plea agreement was aware his payments were being diverted to aid Pugh personally. In the lead-up to the 2016 mayoral primary, J.P. Grant, the owner of Grant Capital Management — a financing company in Columbia, Md., that did business with the city — wrote a $50,000 check to Healthy Holly LLC, court filings show. Grant understood, according to Pugh’s agreement, that the money was intended to produce books for Baltimore students, with the balance going to her campaign. One month after the general election, Pugh told Grant she 'wanted to buy a larger house so she could entertain people when she became mayor' and she took Grant to see the property, according to the agreement she signed. Pugh suggested that Grant write another check to Healthy Holly LLC, this time for $100,000, with the understanding that some money would help her buy the home. None of the money went to print or deliver books to school students.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed papers to join the Democratic race. Michael Scherer reports: “Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision. An adviser said the timing of the filing was triggered by his earlier application for a spot on the Alabama ballot. But Bloomberg’s team has been moving swiftly over the past two weeks to rebuild a presidential campaign operation that was scuttled after he decided earlier this year not to run. … Bloomberg is positioned to be a force to counter the candidates who emerge from the first four nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In defiance of the traditional nominating calendar, Bloomberg has planned to skip those contests to spend heavily in states that will vote in March — including California, Texas and 12 other states that will award delegates on Super Tuesday.”

-- Terrible advance work: Deval Patrick canceled an event at Morehouse College in Atlanta when he showed up on Wednesday night and only two people had come to see him speak. It's an illustration of how little appetite there is for the former Massachusetts governor and also a reminder of how hard it is to jump into the contest so late. (Katie Mettler)

-- The moderates already in the race are striking back in a presidential contest defined so far by liberal litmus tests and one-upmanship. Sean Sullivan reports: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in a well-received debate performance, railed against the costs of the government giving too much away. Sen. Cory Booker cast doubt on a tax on the super-wealthy. … The presidential campaign’s ideological battle is far from settled, however, with staunchly liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) showing a resurgence since his Oct. 1 heart attack. His improvement has put pressure on the other leader on the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), to stand firmly behind liberal priorities as she seeks at the same time to broaden her appeal to more traditional Democrats. …

“The tone of Wednesday’s debate stood in contrast to earlier showdowns that had more anti-establishment, leftward bents. Where there was once criticism from Obama’s left about the former president, Wednesday brought nothing but praise for him, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris’s calls to ‘rebuild the Obama coalition.’ The name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who routinely has counseled a middle course, was invoked positively. The heated exchanges over highly charged issues such as gun buybacks and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings that headlined earlier debates were nowhere to be found.”

-- It seems as if the Democratic candidates have heeded Obama’s warning and discovered that ordinary voters matter more than social-media warriors. From Politico founder John F. Harris: “It often seemed like the candidates had taken to heart Obama’s paternal sermon last week, in which he said is not worried about a long and 'robust' primary process, but urged candidates not to orient their appeals around ‘left-leaning Twitter feeds’ and to recognize that the ‘average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.’ Even Sanders, who has described himself as a revolutionary, said he agreed with Obama. ‘We don’t have to tear down the system but we do have to do what the American people want,’ he said, especially with a health care system that is ‘cruel’ and ‘dysfunctional.’”

-- In Atlanta, Democrats made an urgent bid to court black voters. Chelsea Janes and Sean Sullivan report: “Booker was roaring through metaphors Thursday, quoting Scripture and Langston Hughes to a chorus of ‘Amen!’ and ‘Preach!’ in a room full of African American ministers, when a door opened a few feet away. A staffer ushered in South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who hunched over to sneak past Booker, trying not to interrupt or offend. He took a seat next to the Rev. Al Sharpton, then stood and clapped politely as the audience rose to its feet in raucous applause for Booker’s stemwinder. Toward the back of the room, an attendee observed the entrance of Buttigieg, who was set to follow Booker onstage. ‘Pete’s like, ‘What the hell am I going to do now?!’’ he mused to a friend, and the two dissolved in laughter. Buttigieg and Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday … in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for [Biden] — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances?”

-- Some Latino debate-watchers were disappointed by the few answers the debate offered to their most important questions. Jenna Johnson reports: As the debate “neared its second hour and paused for a commercial break, Diana Vela turned to her friends: ‘I’m waiting for the immigration question. I want to know: Am I getting deported or not?’ Although [Trump’s] wall along the southern border was mentioned, fixing the immigration system was not. … Trump made immigration — and the demonization of immigrants who came to the country illegally — a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and of his presidency, so Vela is surprised that Democrats have not made countering his message one of their top priorities, something deeply discussed at every debate, like health care. … As they watched Democrats churn through another event in the lengthy process of picking a presidential nominee, Vela and other young Latino voters with whom she watched the debate said they often feel forgotten. … Most campaigns have not spent the time and money to fully engage Latino voters, who participate in elections at much lower rates than whites or African Americans. In Georgia, about 2 percent of voters in 2018 were Latino, even though Latinos make up about 10 percent of the population.”

-- Wednesday’s debate on MSNBC captured only 6.5 million viewers overall, making it the least-watched of this cycle. It's a reminder that impeachment has frozen the 2020 race in many ways. (Variety)

-- Biden’s verbal stumbles have some voters worried about his mental fitness. But maybe they’d be more understanding if they knew he’s fighting a stutter, writes the Atlantic’s John Hendrickson: “His eyes fall to the floor when I ask him to describe it. We’ve been tiptoeing toward it for 45 minutes, and so far, every time he seems close, he backs away, or leads us in a new direction. There are competing theories in the press, but [Biden] has kept mum on the subject. I want to hear him explain it. I ask him to walk me through the night he appeared to lose control of his words onstage. ‘I — um — I don’t remember,’ Biden says. His voice has that familiar shake, the creak and the croak. ‘I’d have to see it. I-I-I don’t remember.’ … He stutters — ­if slightly — on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. Before addressing the debate specifically, I mention what I’ve just heard. ‘I want to ask you, as, you know, a … stutterer to, uh, to a … stutterer. When you were … talking a couple minutes ago, it, it seemed to … my ear, my eye … did you have … trouble on s? Or on … m?’ Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific — ' He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”

-- Buttigieg’s campaign staff is unionizing. From the HuffPost: “Buttigieg’s campaign still needs to reach a contract agreement with the workers, who are joining the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2321, which is based in North Andover, Massachusetts. The union will only represent campaign staff with the title of ‘organizer.’ The agreement means three of the four leading Democratic presidential campaigns are now unionized. [Biden’s] campaign is not. ”

-- Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is resisting pressure from Trump on the person to appoint to an interim U.S. Senate post. From the Journal: “In recent days, the president has spoken to Mr. Kemp at least twice — once face-to-face in Atlanta and once on the phone — urging him to pick Rep. Doug Collins (R., Ga.), a vocal supporter of the president in Congress ... Mr. Collins, a white conservative from north Georgia, has pushed for months to get the seat that Sen. Johnny Isakson, 74 years old, is leaving at the end of the year because of health problems. But the governor is leaning toward appointing a female or minority candidate to improve the GOP’s chances in Atlanta’s burgeoning suburbs, key battlegrounds in the 2020 elections.”

-- Campaigns say Google’s new restrictions on political advertising just sidestep the company’s problem with disinformation. From the Times: “The decision to limit campaigns from targeting users based on political affiliation or voter record, which Google announced Wednesday night, was aimed at addressing concerns about invasion of privacy and the exploitation of voters through hyperspecific targeting. But the policy will most likely have little impact on the thornier challenge of disinformation, which campaigns and cybersecurity experts say will be the more urgent problem facing the major social media platforms during the 2020 election. Google’s new policy restricts a tactic — microtargeting of voters — that campaigns heavily rely on, while not aggressively addressing misinformation. … On Thursday, two separate groups of digital strategists — a bipartisan coalition from the University of Chicago, and a group of roughly 40 Democratic and progressive strategists — released letters criticizing Google’s new policy. The letters … both fault Google for not adequately addressing disinformation.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was formally charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, making him the first Israeli premier to be indicted while in office and sending the country’s stalemated political system deeper into disarray. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit capped almost three years of investigation and months of speculation by issuing a 63-page indictment against the country’s longest-serving prime minister and its center of political gravity for the last decade. The cases against Netanyahu center on allegations that the prime minister and his wife, Sara, accepted more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods in exchange for political favors and that Netanyahu interceded with regulators and lawmakers on behalf of two media companies in exchange for positive news stories.

“Netanyahu, 70, has steadfastly denied wrongdoing during a wide-ranging probe that he has dismissed as a politically motivated ‘witch hunt.’ … Few here expect the pugnacious prime minister to do anything ­other than ferociously fight the counts that emerged. Many predict he will seek a vote in parliament granting him some measure of immunity. In a combative address Thursday night, Netanyahu called the indictment ‘a coup attempt’ driven by a corrupt set of prosecutors. He demanded that an independent body review the prosecution. ‘It’s time to investigate the investigators,’ he said.” Sound familiar? It's the same language Trump uses.

-- In Hong Kong, protesters trickled out from a besieged campus as the city prepares for elections. Simon Denyer, Tiffany Liang and Anna Kam report: “Half a dozen protesters, holding hands and wearing face masks, walked out of a besieged Hong Kong university campus and surrendered to police early Friday, leaving only a handful inside after a week-long standoff. Two more followed later, news agencies reported, bringing to around 30 the number who have surrendered in the past day at the Polytechnic University, which front-line pro-democracy protesters had occupied and transformed into a fortified base. … Surrounded by riot police, around 800 protesters surrendered Monday, with adults immediately arrested by police and hundreds of minors allowed to go free after having their names taken, but around 100 were believed to have remained inside.

“Police have said those who surrender could face charges of rioting, which carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence, and there have been fears of more violence if police storm the campus. So far, though, the police have been content to wait out the remaining protesters, whose supplies are diminishing. … On online forums and message groups, protesters advised each other not to wear black — the unofficial uniform of the pro-democracy movement — on Election Day for fear of being detained and denied the right to vote.”

-- Under U.S. pressure, South Korea said it would maintain an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan for now. Min Joo Kim and Simon Denyer report: “Seoul announced Friday it would suspend its decision to terminate the General Security of Military Intelligence Agreement (GSOMIA), hours before the pact was due to expire at midnight local time. Its initial decision not to renew the pact, announced three months ago, came under intense criticism from Washington, which believes that intelligence sharing between its two most important Asian allies is crucial to counter threats from North Korea and China. Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris told the Yonhap news agency that South Korea’s actions put U.S. troops at risk. But Seoul’s decision to postpone its exit from the pact was conditional, again restating a demand that Tokyo reverse an earlier decision to place controls on its exports to South Korea. Friday’s announcement could be seen as giving the two sides breathing space to find a solution to their spat, or as simply kicking the can a little farther down the road.”

-- In Iran, “rage is escalating” as economic stress reaches new levels. Erin Cunningham reports: “The protests have flared in many of the same areas that experienced unrest two years ago, when demonstrators protested a similar proposal to slash state subsidies. Then, as now, lower-income Iranians rose up against a system that they said had failed them economically. But a wider spectrum of society may have joined the revolt this time around, analysts say, pointing to demonstrations in major cities and at universities, including the University of Tehran. Protesters have also clashed with police in urban centers such as Isfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz and Tabriz. Over the past two years, Iran’s economy has worsened because of U.S. sanctions and declining oil sales — revenue the government uses to pay salaries and fund imports. Iran’s economy is expected to contract by 8.7 percent this year, according to the World Bank.”

-- Argentine prosecutors are calling for the international arrest of Gustavo Zanchetta, a Catholic bishop who worked closely with Pope Francis and who’s being accused of sexual abuse. Authorities claim he has gone dark inside Vatican City. Chico Harlan reports: “‘The [request] was imposed after the accused did not respond to repeated phone calls or emails, to the phone number and email voluntarily shared by him’ with authorities, according to a statement from an Argentine provincial prosecutors’ office. The attempt to bring Zanchetta back to Argentina sets up a potential conflict with the Vatican. It raises pressure on the pope to comply with a criminal justice proceeding, after outside experts have called on the church to be more cooperative with civil authorities. And it puts Francis’s judgment under the spotlight. Italian news media reported that Zanchetta is accused of abusing two adult seminarians. Zanchetta, 55, could not be immediately reached for comment. A Vatican spokesman, who is traveling with the pope in Thailand, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.”

-- Thousands of union members and anti-government protesters took to the streets of Colombia, making the Andean nation the latest in South America to break out in large-scale civil unrest. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “The protesters, who waved flags and banners, represented a range of disgruntled sectors of society — students, unions, and leftist and indigenous groups — that share rising anger against the increasingly unpopular government of conservative President Iván Duque. In Bogota, the capital, protesters waved the flags of Chile and Ecuador and carried banners that read ‘South America woke up’ and chanted ‘without violence.’ Videos circulating on social media showed riot police firing tear gas and apprehending demonstrators. Initially called by unions, the strike grew as other sectors joined in, furious over labor, pension and tax reforms being discussed in the national Congress, the killings of community organizers and indigenous leaders, and general dissatisfaction with the government’s failure to fully implement the historic 2016 peace accord with the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.”

-- Graphic videos and images showed a vehicle driving into crowds of Chilean protesters, an incident that could intensify already violent clashes in the country over inequality and economic disparities. Michael Brice-Saddler and Rachelle Krygier report: “The attack appeared to take place Thursday evening in Chile’s northern province of Antofagasta. In videos, protesters dive out of the way as a car speeds down the street into demonstrators. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people were injured as a result. … In response to the protests, which have already resulted in as many as 20 deaths as well as thousands of injuries and arrests, President Sebastián Piñera declared the country was at war — which only served to intensify the protesters’ furor. As videos of Thursday’s attack circulated on social media, people attempted to identify the car and its driver. Some pointed out that after the car drove off, a similar-looking vehicle was seen entering a local police station in Antofagasta. By Thursday night, the Chilean national police force confirmed the attack took place, tweeting that the person responsible had been delivered to their headquarters in Antofagasta.”

The Republican National Committee bought enough copies of Donald Trump Jr.'s book to catapult it onto the bestseller lists.

Among the vast compendium of lore thrown into political discourse by the Iowa Caucuses over the last 40 years or so is this famous slogan from former Democratic congressman Dave Nagle:

There are three rules to success in Iowa … Rule No. 1 is: Organize. Rule No. 2 is: Organize. Rule No. 3 is: You get hot at the end.

This last part about the value of peaking at the right moment is good advice for the candidates forming the Big Four in recent polls of likely caucusgoers (Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden) and for those bottom-feeders thought by some to have a chance of coming from the back of the pack down the home stretch (notably Amy Klobuchar). But simple as Nagle’s three rules are, recent Caucus history is a little more complicated than that, since the “end” at which you need to get “hot” is defined in different ways by different people. Katie Akin of the Des Moines Register offers a useful rundown on the path to victory on Caucus Night of various recent winning candidates in both parties:

Hillary Clinton stayed at the top of 2015 and 2016 Iowa polls, as rival Bernie Sanders climbed steadily closer. The final poll before the caucus had Clinton just 3 points above Sanders, 45 percent to 42 percent. Ted Cruz surged in December, taking first place with 31 percent. No November poll was conducted in 2016. Cruz lost his polling lead in a late-January poll as Donald Trump climbed, but more votes went to Cruz on caucus night. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth place in November 2011. He shot up in the December poll to 15 percent, though he still lagged behind leaders Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. The late momentum carried through caucus night, when he was virtually tied with Romney for first place — and later declared the winner. Mike Huckabee surged in the late November 2007 Iowa poll from third place, with 12 percent, to first place, with 29 percent. The poll was published in early December, one month before Huckabee won the caucus with 34.4 percent of the vote. Barack Obama led the Iowa poll for the first time in November 2007, with 26 percent of the respondents marking him as their first choice. He widened his lead over opponents Hillary Clinton and John Edwards in the late-December poll, ultimately winning the caucuses by a nearly 8-point margin. John Kerry was third place in November 2003, behind Democratic leaders Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt. He leaped to first in a January 2004 poll, from 15 percent to 26 percent, then won the caucus.

These outcomes may not have as much in common as you’d think, aside from winning candidates finishing strong — which of course they did!

HRC won in a tough grind against one other well-organized candidate in a race that had steadily grown closer as Caucus Night approached (She led Bernie Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling averages by about 13 points on January 1, by only by 4 points on the eve of the vote). Cruz maintained an organization far superior to Trump’s, which made his close second in late polls enough for a win. Santorum spent more time in the state than any other 2012 GOP candidate, and benefited from hard-core ideological voters and the late collapse of support for paper tiger front-runner Newt Gingrich. Huckabee was perfectly positioned for Iowa’s social-conservative-heavy Republican activists, and was helped by ultimate nominee John McCain’s refusal to go all in. Barack Obama won by expanding the universe of caucusgoers to include a lot of young voters and independents. And John Kerry successfully did what Kamala Harris has tried to do this year, all but abandoning other states in order to pull off a late Iowa surge.

Nobody in either party has won Iowa without a solid organization and momentum, but the exact timing of when a candidate “surges” has varied. This question is of particular importance to Pete Buttigieg, whose surge in the November Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll resembles that of three recent winners: Cruz, Huckabee, and Obama.

But in that poll, 62 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to change candidates before Caucus Night. That should make Team Pete — and any subsequent Iowa front-runners — nervous."

The Marquette poll found 40 percent of registered voters favoring impeachment of Trump and his removal from office, compared with 44 percent in October. At the same time, 53 percent oppose impeachment and removal, compared with 51 percent the previous month.

Statistically these are tiny-to-insignificant shifts, but the direction of the changes on this and other questions are consistent. From one month to the next, Republican attitudes hardened ever so slightly in favor of the president. As Charles Franklin, who directs the poll, put it, “A Republican rally around Trump is very strongly demonstrated in the poll.”

Meanwhile, Democratic attitudes, while still overwhelmingly in favor of impeachment and removal, softened slightly. Support for impeachment among independents went from a margin of 22 points to a margin of 11 points.

AD

AD

Franklin pointed to another set of findings showing that 42 percent of registered voters saying Trump did something “seriously wrong,” 9 percent saying he did something “wrong” and 38 percent saying he did “nothing wrong.” He called that “the even split we see in Wisconsin politics.”

The survey was conducted Nov. 13-17, which means it began the day of the testimony by William B. Taylor Jr., the senior diplomat in Ukraine, and concluded after testimony from Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was removed from her post last spring on orders from the president. The survey, with a margin of error was plus-or-minus 4.1 percentage points, was completed before this past week’s testimony, including that of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.

The results from Wisconsin also showed that, since the summer, the Democratic candidates have seen clear slippage in their support in hypothetical matchups with the president. Former vice president Joe Biden led the president by 51 percent to 42 percent in August. By October the margin was 50 percent to 44 percent. The latest poll flips the script. Trump now is ahead of Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent. The shift came primarily from movement among independents, either away from the former vice president to Trump or to a posture of saying they liked neither candidate.

AD

AD

Similar shifts have taken place in matchups between Trump and other potential Democratic challengers. Trump leads Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by 48 percent to 45 percent. He is ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) by 48 percent to 43 percent after being in a dead heat with her previously. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has risen among Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys, is trailing the president by 47 percent to 39 percent.

Franklin described the findings on Biden, Sanders and Warren as a shift from what was “a modest, mostly inside the margin of error” advantage for the Democrats to “a modest, mostly inside the margin of error” advantage for the president. He added, “That’s what you would expect in a battleground state.”

On the electoral college map, Wisconsin might be considered the quintessential battleground state heading into 2020. Its current political culture and partisan divisions are a microcosm of the nation. The divisions long predated Trump’s presidency but began to intensify during former Republican governor Scott Walker’s two terms in office and more so the past three years.

The 2000 presidential election saw the state go Democratic by two-tenths of a percentage point. The 2004 presidential elections tipped to the Democrats by four-tenths of a point. Barack Obama proved to be an anomaly, winning the state in 2008 by double-digits and in 2012 by about seven points. After Obama, Wisconsin reverted to its earlier status as a true battleground. Trump carried it by eight-tenths of a point, about 23,000 votes.

Trump’s current approval rating in the state, according to the Marquette poll, is 47 percent — higher than his national number and about the same as it was in the poll in October. Republicans are more unified behind him today than they were when he first ran for president.

Wisconsin has settled into a rough parity in partisan identification. Where once there was a modest Democratic advantage in party identification among voters, today it is basically even. It is also a state in flux politically, reshaped by the same forces and changing voter coalitions that are changing politics in other states.

AD

AD

The urban-rural divide has widened in recent years. Rural areas in Wisconsin, as in many other states, have become more Republican, especially during Trump’s presidency. Meanwhile, Democrats have made gains in suburban counties in Wisconsin that once voted strongly Republican.

Counties around Milwaukee still favor Republicans but not by the margins of the past, as evidenced by the midterm election returns in 2018. Walker did worse in his home areas in southeast Wisconsin in 2018 than in his previous campaigns but better in rural areas in the northwest. The slippage in suburban areas has become a cause for concern among some Republican strategists who work the state regularly.

Wisconsin is one of three states of critical importance in 2020, the others being Michigan and Pennsylvania. All three went for Trump after consistently supporting Democratic nominees in a string of elections. If nothing else changes on the electoral map, which is to say if Trump again wins Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa, Democrats need the three northern states to capture the presidency or find substitutes elsewhere.

AD

AD

Of those three, Wisconsin could be the most difficult to convert. All three states now have Democratic governors, but Wisconsin’s Tony Evers won in 2018 by a percentage point over Walker; Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf both won by comfortable margins. Wisconsin’s population is whiter than the other two. Wisconsin’s union infrastructure, a valuable source of voter mobilization help, has deteriorated, thanks to Walker’s assault on public employee unions.

Democrats in Congress are moving forward to impeach the president and leaders have said that constitutional prerogatives, not political considerations, should shape the proceedings. But there will be political fallout, which is why attitudes from Wisconsin bear watching. Much can change in the weeks and months ahead, but the modest shifts in the past month are a reminder to Democrats that public opinion is not currently moving in their direction.

As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts.

AD

Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.

“I literally had someone say, ‘How are you going to beat Donald Trump with love, Cory?’ ” he said after an event Friday in New Hampshire, placing himself in the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. “And I laughed. You don’t know our history! That’s how we always win! King said, ‘Darkness can’t drive out darkness; only love can do that.’”

AD

Everywhere Booker goes these days — in press gaggles and at candidate forums, in Iowa church pews and New Hampshire town halls — he is followed by questions about why his bid is still stuck in the low single digits.

AD

The senator from New Jersey’s stock answer is that he just needs more time, a few more donors — “Please go to corybooker.com,” he pleaded at the last debate — and the wisdom to remember that past Democratic nominees Barack Obama and John Kerry were trailing at this point in their primary campaigns.

But in moments of candor, he can be more reflective. “This is the challenge,” he told one loyal volunteer last month who had asked at a town hall in West Des Moines what more she could do to get his name out there.

AD

He even betrayed some frustration at the debate last week about his ability to break through. “I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage,” he said, in a dig at the attention that has been drawn to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The broader dilemma he faces has bedeviled more than a dozen campaigns this cycle. Those out of the top tier struggle as they seek even minimal attention, and without attention they cannot reach the top tier.

AD

“Until voting starts, the way voters can determine viability is through things like fundraising, polling and earned-media coverage,” said Meredith Kelly, a Democratic strategist who advised the short-lived campaign of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). “And if you aren’t considered worthy of going viral, worthy of being a top-tier candidate by cable news and big donors, then it becomes this self-fulfilling cycle.”

AD

Booker’s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, told The Washington Post that Booker’s success has often been unfairly contrasted with the high expectations set by a political establishment that long saw him as a rising star.

“We have a high bar to clear,” he said Saturday. “And the reality is he’s been clearing it, particularly in the early states. But the metric that the press has been paying the most attention to is polling — not endorsements, not favorability, not consideration. We’re winning by those metrics. It’s only the horse race that we’re not winning, yet.”

AD

Booker’s campaign message, a departure from the rest of the pack, has so far failed to overcome the challenge, although he says he has attracted a devoted following. His fundraising jumped after Wednesday’s debate — his campaign anticipated it will have collected $1 million by the end of the weekend — and he points to relatively high favorability in recent Democratic polls.

AD

His announcement video, scored to a drum-line beat, showed him walking the graffiti-strewn streets of Newark, yelling “What’s up?” to a passerby. An early endorser of Medicare-for-all, he has campaigned on legalizing marijuana and expunging the records of the mostly nonwhite Americans with minor drug convictions.

This was a departure from the more buttoned-up approach he took in his first Senate campaign, a 2013 special election, in which he ran ads that showed him in a suit and tie, speaking in glass-walled conference rooms, with graphics about bringing in “new business” and a voice-over that promised innovation and to “reach for new answers.” As a senator, he has been known as a more moderate Democrat, earning financial support from former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, supporting charter schools and voting against a bill to encourage the importation of drugs from Canada.

AD

As a presidential candidate, by contrast, he has more closely identified with the struggles of urban populations. Like Sen.Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and former housing secretary Julián Castro, Booker has argued that the party needs to focus on black voters to increase turnout in cities like Detroit and Philadelphia in the general election. But the positioning has yet to earn any of them a spike in support among black voters, who continue to back former vice president Joe Biden in polls.

AD

Interviews with black voters in South Carolina found high praise for Booker’s message. But those same voters repeatedly stopped short of supporting him.

“He may be eloquent and he may be educated, but will they vote for him?” asked Wilma Doyle, 74, a retired schoolteacher from Greenville who said she likes almost everything about Booker. “He is good, but I don’t think he has the best chance.”

AD

David Gaston, 75, a Vietnam veteran from Greenwood, said he likes Booker personally, but still ranks Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) ahead of him in his preference for a nominee.

“Sometimes, you’ve got to fight. When you’re in a war, you’ve got to fight,” Gaston said. “Biden has the knowledge of how the world works. Elizabeth Warren is a fighter.”

AD

Booker has approached the campaign, instead, as a moment for national inspiration and spiritual rebirth.

“Love is not sentimentality,” Booker said Friday at a University of New Hampshire town hall in Durham. “Love is service. Love is sacrifice. Love is saying, ‘Hey, if your kids don’t have a great public school to go to, my kids are lesser off.’ Love says that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”

He hugged an audience member for asking a question about poverty.

AD

To make the cut for the December debate, Booker will need to score 4 percent or higher in four party-sanctioned polls over the coming weeks. He has so far failed to reach that level in any party-sanctioned poll published since mid-October.

AD

Even if he does not make the cut, he has vowed to continue his campaign, with a pathway that remains focused on Iowa. He has devoted significant resources to the first-voting state, hiring an early statewide staff of 50, including several aides who got tattoos of the slogan “We Rise” in Booker’s handwriting.

“Booker could actually do incredibly well here. He has a great organization, has a great staff. They’ve got great endorsements,” said Grant Woodard, a Des Moines attorney and former Democratic strategist who is unaffiliated in the race. “But there’s just so much noise with all these other candidates running.”

AD

At his second New Hampshire event Friday, 125 people overflowed a brewery in downtown Portsmouth, where organizers had planned for 50 people.

After Booker finished speaking, Greg Norris, a marketing executive, hung in the back of the event space with a beer as his 18-year-old son waited in line for a selfie with the senator.

“I think his message of inclusion is right on,” Norris said about his first time seeing Booker. “I’m very surprised that he hasn’t gotten the traction. When you look at just the qualifications, the way he speaks, a level of intelligence, the education, the experience, I’m really surprised, relative to the other candidates.”

But Norris still wasn’t sold. He said he was not yet ready to say he would vote for Booker."

One of the really unfortunate consequences of Donald Trump’s presidency isn’t an impeachable offense. But it has arguably deranged many political observers and regular voters who now believe his improbable election in 2016 has abolished every single rule of logic, history, and even common sense in terms of who might succeed him in office. The most obvious example of this anybody-can-win bender is the sudden belief of every other billionaire in this country that they ought to at least consider a presidential run. Two of them are actually in the race.

But another is the proliferation of asinine theories about which Trump challengers have a plausible rationale for candidacy, or who might (as the saying always goes) strike fear into the hearts of the president and his cronies. The worst yet arrived this weekend at The Hill from former Republican staffer and freelance pundit Douglas MacKinnon. I won’t go through his litany of examples of occasions when the pundits have been wrong about presidential nominating contests; needless to say he doesn’t bother to mention the many other times the conventional wisdom has been right and the many other times there were mild upsets that were by no means Trump-size. Here’s where he lands, though:

As one who was involved in three winning presidential campaigns, I have watched the ever-evolving Democratic primary campaign for 2020 with growing interest. Over the course of the past year, I’ve discussed with a number of friends and political operatives from both parties that the two Democrats who should strike the most fear in Trump are Buttigieg and Gabbard.

Since precisely zero people have publicly made this argument, you have to wonder if by “discussed” MacKinnon means that these “friends and political operatives” were just listening to him and rolling their eyes.

The headline mentions a “ticket” and the column itself refers to Buttigieg and Gabbard as a “package,” but MacKinnon does not explicitly say which candidate should be the presidential nominee and which the veep. I don’t know if that was intended to boost the odds of this prophecy coming true from .000001 percent to .00001 percent, or was just an oversight in a piece tossed off between drinks or before breakfast. Perhaps more to the point, MacKinnon never really explains why this combination of candidates would be so powerful. We get, on Mayor Pete’s behalf, the unsupported assertion that America is “more than ready” to elect a gay president (I hope that’s true, but I would like to see maybe a speck of evidence), and apparently Gabbard’s big credential is that Hillary Clinton attacked her. Then there’s this clincher:

As a package, those two candidates, with their various skill sets and experiences, do speak to a great many communities and demographics across the country.

Yes, and so would a ticket composed of Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang. That doesn’t mean it makes any sense or would have a snowball’s chance in hell of happening.

MacKinnon was involved in campaigns during the era of Reagan and Poppy Bush, so maybe he’s stuck there and thinks it’s crucial for Democrats to run military veterans. That’s really about the only thing Gabbard and Buttigieg have in common other than being half the age of Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders. Perhaps the weirdest thing about this particular suggestion is that it comes so soon after a Democratic candidate debate in which a nasty quarrel between Buttigieg and Gabbard provided the main drama. Here’s how it was summarized by The Hill, the publication that ran MacKinnon’s column:

Democratic presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard tussled Wednesday night over prior experience and judgment after the Hawaii congresswoman said the South Bend, Ind., mayor wanted to use the U.S. military to fight drug cartels in Mexico, which he denied …

Buttigieg called the accusation “outlandish” and said his comments had been taken out of context. He said he had been talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation and continuing to develop existing law enforcement and military cooperation between the two countries …

﻿Buttigieg on Wednesday countered that he has “enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like” Syrian President Bashar Assad, with whom Gabbard met in 2017.

Gabbard shot back that Buttigieg had made clear that he “would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation.”

These candidates do not appear to like each other. Their ticket is so not happening, and it’s impossible to believe anyone in the White House is losing a moment’s sleep over it. Next, someone will tell us an all-billionaire ticket of Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg (with first and second places TBD) would surely rout the MAGA hordes. It’s about as likely."

As the decade began, there were rea­sons to be optimistic: America had elected its first black president, and despite a global recession just two years earlier, the world hadn’t cascaded into total financial collapse. Obama­care, for all its flaws, was passed, and then came the Iran deal and the Paris climate accords. Sure, there were danger signs: the anger of the tea party, the slow hollowing out of legacy news media, a troubling sense that somehow the bankers got away with it. But then maybe the immediacy of social media gave some hope, at least if you listened to the chatter of the bright young kids in the Bay Area trying to build a new kind of unmediated citizenship. Maybe every­day celebrity, post-­gatekeeper, would change the world for the better. Some of that happened. But we also ended up with the alt­-right and Donald Trump, inequality, impeachment, and debilitating FOMO. How did we get here? Throughout this week, we will be publishing long talks with six people who helped shape the decade — and were shaped by it — to hear what they’ve learned. Read them all here.

If the racial politics of the 2010s has a definitive chronicler, it is Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose magisterial 2014 Atlantic essay “The Case for Reparations” forced Americans to reckon with slavery, Jim Crow, and redlining in ways that many of them never had. Since the essay’s publication — which eventually prompted a congressional hearing on the subject this year, at which Coates testified — the 44-year-old has won a National Book Award for his 2015 book, Between the World and Me, and was awarded a MacArthur “genius” grant. More recently, he’s been writing fiction: He scripted a run of Marvel’s Black Panther comic and published his celebrated first novel, The Water Dancer, which concerns an enslaved man gifted with supernatural powers in antebellum Virginia. Coates’s expansive imagination and incisive, historically grounded writing about Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and cultural figures like Kanye West has cemented his status as a writer through whose eyes many Americans have come to understand the modern era — including me.

Let’s talk about race and politics in the 2010s.

It’s Obama’s decade, unquestionably, which is not to say he was always the prime actor, but I think the force of a black president was such a historic and seismic event that everything, including my conversation with you right now, just was touched by it. It’s really like if I had to pick a singular thing that defined the decade, it would probably be the thing that happened before the 2010s, and that was his election.

The actual start of the decade did mark the beginning of an ill-defined something in politics with the rise of the tea party. If you wanted to mark it there, you would say his losing the House majority, right?

Yeah. We get this electoral manifestation of right-wing backlash for the first time.

How did 2010 affect your understanding of political partisanship? Is partisanship a useful frame through which to understand racism in the past ten years?

I would probably say it the other way and say racism is a useful frame to understand partisanship since the 1960s. The Republican Party is effectively a white party in this country. It’s the party of a white majority that greatly fears becoming a white minority. You have to separate the fact of Obama being a black man from the fact that that black man represented a multiracial party. That’s very, very important. One of the things that I actually even heard Obama himself say was, “Well, I don’t know how much of the opposition is about race because Bill Clinton got it pretty bad before me.” But see, Bill Clinton represented the party that was most associated with black people. He represented, too, a multiracial party. I think Hillary Clinton would have been racialized in the same way. I don’t think you escaped it because you’re white. True, Obama was a much more intense representation of it, but it was really those two things working together. It’s the figure of a black president. At the same time, that figure representing a multiracial party in opposition to a party that is effectively a white party. As much as the tea-party movement in 2010 is just a line of demarcation, you have the current president’s invocation of birtherism, and birtherism is little more than telling the first black president, “Go back to Africa.” It’s not a mistake that throughout Obama’s presidency, you could poll the Republican Party and find anywhere from half to a solid majority of people who actually were birtherists. That’s not accidental. Racism is and was core to what the Republican Party is, which is not to say it has no manifestation and no effect in the Democratic Party.

Birtherism strikes me as one of the few things Trump has done that Republicans haven’t been explicitly willing to defend, even as they do stuff like rationalize his defense of white supremacists in Charlottesville. But there’s also been no broader reckoning with its effect or with how successful it was in getting a number of current Republican representatives into office, either.

Totally. Some of them know better, but that’s always been true. George Wallace — you know his story. Wallace was liked by the NAACP and was liked by black people, and his earliest campaign for governor did not want to make segregation and racism central to his campaign. Then he lost to a guy who went out and did that. He said, “I will never be out-n—–ed again.” He said, “I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about ‘n—–s,’ and they stomped the floor.” It’s a guy that probably knew better. Some of these folks, if they are not racist themselves — and I’m willing to grant that — they don’t find racism so odious and so offensive that they either (a) would not stoop to using it themselves or (b) don’t mind the occupant of the White House using it or being a racist himself.

It does seem odd that with Charlottesville, they’ll bend over backward to be like, “Oh, he didn’t mean that when he was talking about very fine people on both sides,” but with birtherism, Jared Kushner’s like, “I wasn’t around for that. I don’t know about that.” It’s just a very kind of confusing divide to me.

Whenever you have power, you get to delineate history where you want to delineate history. It starts where you want it to matter.

You’ve said that Obama’s presidency made your work possible in that it created this interest and audience for the type of analysis that you were uniquely well positioned to provide. If that’s the case, why do you think people gravitated toward your fairly downbeat analysis of Obama, this figure who inspired a lot of hope and warm feelings?

I really don’t know. I’ve always thought of my job as to try to arrive to some sort of truth, render that truth in a way that is as convincing and as powerful as possible to myself, and then present it to the world. But why people are moved by the things they are moved by, I don’t know. I will say this: I think I am one who has always been attracted to the power of storytelling, whereas if I were, say, a columnist at the New York Times, I don’t know that that effect would’ve held in the same way.

Do you think what Obama made possible in cultural conversation and political conversation extends to this resurgent interest in black cultural products? I’m thinking of stuff like Black Panther, Barry Jenkins’s work.

I really do, because I think there are two ways of analyzing Obama. There’s a politics of him, and there’s Obama as a mythical figure, the symbolic aspect of what he is. People sometimes think the symbols are not very important. I think symbols are really, really important. There’s a reason people fight over the Confederate flag. There’s a reason that Charlottesville starts with wanting a statue of Robert E. Lee to remain. Symbols open people’s minds to what’s possible. It actually was quietly really important that while Barack Obama never disguised the fact that he was biracial, he identified as a black man. He was really clear about that. He managed to assert himself as a black person without any sort of denialism about what his actual ancestry was. I think that was really inspiring to a lot of black people and a lot of white people. I don’t think it was everything. I don’t think it was enough, but I think one should not underestimate the power of Obama as a symbol of the first black president.

Because I’ll tell you one thing, if Obama, let’s say, had been Bill Clinton, right? Like if Obama had been credited to all these rumors of him womanizing or fraternizing with all these white women, and if he had been found to have, God forbid, actual rape allegations on top of that, and if he had been found to, I don’t know, carry on an affair with some 22-year-old white intern, the effect would have been devastating. Negroes would have been hanging their heads like, I cannot believe. And that’s about the symbolism. That’s not about policy.

Is it that Obama was a symbol we could collectively feel good about, who made us feel good about ourselves and our place in America as black people, while also making white people feel good about their ability to tolerate us?

Yeah, it probably did. People forget that Obama is immensely popular with black people, like probably the most popular person maybe after his wife. Why is that? Is that because of policy? No, he is confirming something in them. There’s something in black folks that they feel good about when they see him. And there probably is a critical mass of white people who feel good maybe for other reasons but feel good themselves. Part of that is about the way he conducts himself in public. When Michelle said for the first time in her life, she’s proud to be an American, I bet a lot of black people felt the same way. You got this guy, the embodiment of all of these middle-class values that America preaches and also the black community actually believe in themselves, and here it’s embodied and modeled before the world for eight years. Before Obama, most famous black people were all entertainers. And now you got an actual head of state who conducts himself in a way that you would want your son to conduct himself.

Has that then translated into, okay, so maybe there’s more to us as black people that’s worth investing in, and that’s why we have these cultural products?

Probably not for most, but for some critical mass of white people who probably were already somewhat susceptible to it, yes.

What to you are sort of the most important, impactful, memorable, cultural products of this decade?

Jesmyn Ward, Salvage the Bones, which I just finished a couple of weeks ago and I’m still recovering from. Kendrick Lamar —

Any particular album?

I got to say Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. I felt like he was talking about my childhood, 20 years before. I think about “The Art of Peer Pressure,” and that just sounded like being a kid in the late ’80s, early ’90s. Creed is incredible. Absolutely marvelous film. What it does that it probably doesn’t get enough credit for is it takes a white myth that was, let’s just say, problematic, and it heals. It heals the disturbing things about it, actually. You know what I mean? The Warmth of Other Suns, is that in the period?

That was 2010.

So The Warmth of Other Suns. Absolutely revolutionary. I always felt like it was the spiritual mother of “The Case for Reparations.” What it did was focus on that class of strivers, as opposed to how most books about black people focus on the black poor. It pointed out to me that people think of racism as synonymous to class. What Isabel was showing was even among people who you think of as middle class, they actually have not escaped. You know that you’re not talking about another manifestation of class. You’re talking about an axis that works independent of class along with class. That race is itself a kind of class. And no matter how a much of a striver you are or how middle class you are, it still exerts a penalty on you.

I think of the late ’80s and early ’90s as this kind of explosion of black popular culture with Spike’s heyday and all these black sitcoms that kind of fizzled. Does this current wave feel sustainable in a way that that wasn’t?

I think this time is fundamentally different. The technology has changed.

You talking about the ’80s, you’re talking about no internet, right? The pathways to really get a message out are constricted and the people that control those pathways don’t tend to be black. Also you’re talking about a point that is closer to the civil-rights movement. It is much, much closer to the point where at least nominally America has embraced integration. When I think about somebody like Jesmyn Ward winning the National Book Award twice, right? When I think about Barry winning the Oscar, when I think about Ryan and Creed and how Creed should have won the Oscar. And then when I think about Black Panther and it’s the first comic-book movie in the Best Picture conversations. When I think about how Ava basically got Linda Fairstein shunned by society, I think that’s a different level of power. Obama’s been gone for, what, three years now? Black Panther is after Obama, When They See Us is after Obama. And I know I frighten people even in saying what I’m saying here, but I think probably what you have is more black people in institutional places. You probably have, again, that small but critical mass of white people who’ve been influenced. Black people have shown that you can make money off of black things, as crass as that sounds. We got to talk about Kaepernick, too. We don’t have to talk about him right now, but we got to talk about him before we —

Now’s a good time. I’m embarrassed to say I have not been following the tryout drama as closely as I should have been.

I don’t think you missed much.

Well, talk about it. What’s on your mind about Kaepernick?

I don’t know how things will be looked at 20, 30 years from now, but I think Kaepernick is really, really important.

Is he like Muhammad Ali important in that, like, in 50 years everyone will pretend that this was our hero all along?

I think when he’s no longer dangerous, when he’s no longer trying to get a job, when he’s 40, when he’s 50, a lot of people will be standing up to honor him. This is like how when everybody looks back at the civil-rights movement, they think everybody was like, “Yeah, that’s a great idea.” Clearly, we recognize Bull Connor as the enemy, and this is the good guy. That’s not really how it goes, man. This is exactly like it’s happening with Kaepernick right now. It’s a little messy, you know what I mean? The people pushing for the change ain’t always right. They’re not always pursuing it in the best strategic fashion. The whole country is divided and polarized; the black community itself, polarized and divided. But once the dust settles, I think it will be quite clear what happened.

Even just watching how the public workout went this weekend, I’ve marveled at how well the NFL has normalized the blackballing of Colin Kaepernick. A lot of people basically tried to answer the question, did Kaepernick conduct himself appropriately this weekend? And so the lines of debate begin right now; they don’t begin with a multibillion-dollar business that has an effective monopoly depriving somebody of the right to work because they don’t like what they said, while at the same time granting that right to work to people who have all sorts of problems and issues. Here we are, debating whether Colin Kaepernick should have worn a Kunta Kinte shirt. Meanwhile, Richie Incognito is fine. It’s a real lesson that, despite whatever progress, when you have power, you can do horrible, inhumane, deeply wrong things, and you can normalize those things.

In many ways, this Kaepernick thing is a perfect emblem of white supremacy because they call you the day of the tryout and tell you you got two hours to decide, but it’s either this way or no way. But we never take a second to analyze why are we fighting on this ground? How did we get to the point where the person who’s actually doing the blackballing is considered an equal and legitimate partner? I think that mirrored a larger frame for the politics that happened in this era with Obama and everything around race. People who had done horrible and heinous things nonetheless conferred a kind of legitimacy.

But at the same time, Kaepernick got the 30th-anniversary “Just Do It” Nike campaign. He’s being lionized in this other sphere, which is also a related sphere. NFL and Nike, they do business, right?

They’re unrelated in terms of who they think their base is. Nike, at least part of its legitimacy, it feels, comes from the streets, and who it sells to is young people. But I take your point. It’s very different than Muhammad Ali, right? There was no place for Muhammad Ali to go to in that same sort of way. And I think part of that is the real progress that has happened in terms of how black people are seen in the wider society. Even young people, you probably couldn’t have put Muhammad Ali in an ad in 1968 or done what was done with Colin Kaepernick. He’s eating just fine in a way that Muhammad Ali was not.

Can we talk about Obama’s post-presidency? What do you make of it?

I don’t know. I think in the midst of everything that has happened, I understand the president saying, “Listen, I’m not going to comment on the doings of my successor.” That’s the tradition, right? But I think it puts in stark relief some of the other things Obama is willing to comment on. It’s a little tough to hear, in the midst of the administration pursuing a policy that literally puts children in cages, the president bragging about sexual assault, believes in insulting somebody in real time while they testify before Congress, claiming during his campaign that somebody can’t be his judge because, in his word, he’s a Mexican — it’s tough to see somebody that has the gravitas of Obama, then at the moment they’re speaking out, it’s about some kids on Twitter and cancel culture. That’s a little hard to take. Young people have no power. Obama can’t be canceled, not by them, but the people that are actively at this very moment trying to cancel him, the person who designed his entire presidency around the cancel culture of the Obama administration itself —

By that you mean negating the legacy, negating the gains, negating the policy?

Totally. Trump has been really open about this. His entire identity is a negative identity, by which I mean he defines himself by his ability to take apart the legacy of Barack Obama. It’s just not clear to me what the advantage is in Obama deploying his power in that way. I don’t know who it helps.

If Joe Biden was black, even black people would be like, ’Oh, absolutely not.’

It’s understandable to me that a president would consider it politically expedient to avoid talking about racism in any kind of profound, challenging way, which I think is the core of your criticism of Obama, that he really avoided this subject.

But more than that, the way he addressed people without power. There’s probably a strong political argument for not saying white supremacy is at the core of America. Listen, you’re a president of the United States. I get it. I’m not saying you have to talk like me, but I just think the harshness in the way he talks about people who lack power. I guess what he would say is, “I’m trying to tell them something that would actually help. Da da da da da.” I don’t know that it always comes across that way. I think as a whole, our obsession with young people and what’s happening on college campuses is deeply unhealthy. It bespeaks people who don’t remember being young themselves. So maybe he’s just a part of that, but when the damage is done by Trump and they ask, “What was the first black president talking about?,” and the answer is some kids on college campuses or some people on Twitter. Well, I just, I don’t like how that sounds.

There are now three black candidates running for the Democratic nomination, none of whom seem to be catching on with voters in any meaningful way. What do you think a black candidate has to do to get elected post-Obama?

First of all, you can’t be the first again. That’ll never happen. So the sheer amount of energy that was generated at that particular moment in time following a president who had just basically run the country into the gutter, failed wars. Two failed wars, economy on the brink, all of everything feeling like it’s breaking. Then you get this black dude who comes in, and he’s able to not just capture that feeling from larger Americans, but very specifically become the embodiment of certain things about the black imagination or the black political imagination. You’re just not going to do that again. So that’s the first thing. The second thing is that Barack Obama was not the first black dude to run. There’s this sort of notion that, oh, Barack Obama shows up and then black people just sort of fall over themselves to vote for him. Black people are actually very savvy and very canny. I don’t support Joe Biden for president, but I totally understand why most black people do. I totally understand why the person that’s running second to him in a lot of places is Bernie Sanders. It’s not a mistake. The other thing too is people forget that Obama was just a damn good politician. No disrespect, but what we got? Three candidates? Do any of them have the oratorical skills that Barack had?

Absolutely not.

If he was white, he would have been a remarkable figure as a politician.

The notion that you’re just going to show up and be black and we’re going to follow — it just don’t work like that. The larger populace is sort of amazed that Kamala Harris or Cory Booker hasn’t captured more of the black imagination and black folks in polls, but it’s not that amazing. Barack Obama is just a unique dude, man.

It does seem like the calculus post-Obama among black voters is who we think can win, and part of that calculus is white folks are racist. So what needs have to be fulfilled by a black candidate to win?

I’m not sure. Perhaps what would help is to understand who it could not be. No black person could be who Pete Buttigieg is. You’re not going to be mayor or whatever. You can’t be a black person who’s only been in there and then say, “Hey, I’m going to run the entire country.” That just don’t fly, you know? So it’s probably going to be somebody out of the Senate or the governorship somewhere. I don’t know what would have happened if Deval Patrick had a run from the beginning. I think you got to be a damn fine politician. And you can’t even be Joe Biden, by the way. I don’t even want to pick on Pete Buttigieg. If Joe Biden was black, even black people would be like, “Oh, absolutely not.” He’s going to get killed out there. Bumbling his way through shit. You’re like absolutely no, no, no, no. Absolutely not. But I think a lot of black folks are banking on the white candidate, which may not be wrong.

Trump did this big event in Atlanta recently where he’s promising to fight for every black vote, which was rightly ridiculed. At the same time, he did better with black voters than Mitt Romney or John McCain.

That’s a bad comparison, though. I mean, come on.

Well, let me give you a few other things. House Democrats did worse with black voters in 2018 than they did in 2016. Stacey Abrams in 2018 did worse in Georgia with black voters than Hillary Clinton did in 2016.

I still don’t buy it, Zak. You’re still not going to get me. But go ahead.

They’re obviously very small shifts. Who knows if they mean anything? They do suggest to me that —

They also aren’t apples to apples or oranges to oranges. Hillary Clinton is not running for the same office as Stacey Abrams was.

It’s not crazy to think that Trump showing up in Atlanta and at least trying, like, this dude has nowhere to go but up. The needle could be moved a point or two conceivably.

You know what I would like to see? I would like to see the past 20 years of voting data in terms of black people and Republicans. If you could show me a trend line that was only briefly interrupted by Barack Obama, then I believe you. But I think I’ve seen this comparison out there, and for the most part, you’re talking about different kinds of elections. The question to me is not “Is Trump more successful than Romney or McCain?” The question to me is probably, “Is he more successful than Bush?”

I don’t think he was.

That’s the closest like-to-like I can get. I think black support for Trump is vastly overstated. I guess I kind of resent the basis on which the question is asked. Trump gets — how many more did he get than Romney and McCain?

It was a couple of points.

Meanwhile, white people are voting for a dude who bragged openly about sexual assaults. Why are we not afforded a couple points? Why can’t a couple n—–s be crazy? Excuse my language.

This isn’t to me a question of whether there’s something wrong with us, actually. My question is whether there’s something about Trump that is slightly more appealing, even to kind of fringe black voters.

What I am countering is the very fact that this is significant enough for us to talk about, I think, attests to the kind of, again, normalization that you get when you have power. There are much more significant factors than those two or three points in why Trump is in office. Why does he have power in the first place? I would argue that those two or three points are nowhere near as important as the fact that Trump basically got a majority of every single white demographic you could think of. Majority of every economic cross-section of white people. We’re having this debate about two or three points among black people. But it’s normal for white people to support the dude that thinks foreign policies should be done by tweet. Nobody goes to white people and says, “What in the hell is wrong with y’all?”

I think there has been a thorough critique of the white vote for Trump. Maybe especially in the circles that we are —

Probably so. In our circles, yes. I would agree.

You’ve withdrawn from both social media and nonfiction writing generally for a while to focus on stuff for Marvel and then The Water Dancer. Is there anything at all you’ve seen happen and been like, Oh man, if I wasn’t so busy doing this other stuff, that would be something I would really love to tackle in a big way?

All the time. I wish I was writing about Kaepernick right now. One of the decisions I had to make, though, was am I at my strongest commenting on the day-to-day, or am I at my strongest when I wait, hold my fire, watch, think, let things marinate, and then turn out something that’s more fully formed? This was part of leaving Twitter. I mean, one of the hardest things to do was I had to part with another portion of myself, the blogging portion of myself, the Twitter portion of myself, which I really liked. But the world kind of changed for me, and it became one in which I had to be a lot more careful about what I said and what I did and that’s okay.

Can you talk about your decision to leave Twitter?

You know, what happened was I realized that people were, like, eating off of me. I’ve got a buddy in another field who did something really popular, and he would get criticism sometimes, and he says, “It’s all right man. Everybody eats. I get to eat, the haters get to eat.” That was his thing. I didn’t realize people were eating, man. So every time I would write a piece, I’d get me like 50 fucking responses.

Like written essays, you’re saying?

There’d be like 50 op-eds to what I wrote. I was like, Damn, people are really eating off of this. And then it would be a click economy on Twitter.

During the 2016 campaign, there was a dude and he would like record YouTube videos responding to what I wrote. I realized I have gone to a point where I have more influence and fame then I have thought to dream of. So when I say something, it’s no longer just the writing talking. So that changes, man. You start taking up oxygen in the room. Why don’t I cede some space. Why don’t I be a lot more discerning about when I talk, because what I really care about is the writing. I’m a happier person, by the way, too, having done that.

But I wonder if, do you feel any responsibility to the people? I think it’s fair to say a lot of people turn to you to help them make sense of this cultural moment in a way that was positive, people who made sense of the world through the lens of your analysis. Do you feel any kind of residual responsibility toward those people?

Are you talking about yourself?

I really miss you, man. Come back.

You can text me anytime!

But seriously, just one example: Conversations about racism are easier with a lot of white people I know. I can attribute that largely to your work.

I mean, that’s a good thing. I’m at the end of the book tour right now. I did a big thing in L.A. with Ryan Coogler where we talked to a church full of black folks. I did these small groups in Atlanta, in L.A., in New Orleans, where I got to talk to small groups of black folks. In the middle of this tour, I got to hang out on the Yard at Howard homecoming. I have no problem talking to my people. Something else happens with the larger and white public. That’s cool, too. I think there are very, very few writers who can say they don’t want a larger audience. And if I happen to get a larger audience but I can still stay true to those impulses and instincts that got me here in the first place, then I’m happy. I’m doing all right.

Your article “The Case for Reparations” is credited with reparations being discussed as a very serious policy proposal now. You testified in front of Congress about it. What have your one-on-one conversations about reparations with elected officials been like?

I’ve actually only talked to two people, Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren. It was before she was a presidential candidate. I mean, maybe she was thinking about it. I didn’t get the impression she was. She had just read the piece and, I think, just thought it’d be really cool to talk to the person that wrote it. In terms of other candidates, I like the fact that I don’t really want to be the kind of person that’s consulted by candidates.

So when you were called to testify in front of Congress, nobody sat down with you? They were just like, “Come talk,” basically?

Yeah, that was basically it. I didn’t want to do it. I feel like I speak through the literature. At that point, I felt like I was stepping more into an activist role, and it’s not a space I really want to be in. But at the same time, I felt like so many black folks in the past have sacrificed for me to even have the privilege of saying I didn’t want to be in that role that I kind of had to.

Can you envision a scenario where reparations is (a) formally studied, (b) agreed upon as a thing that should be done, (c) paid out, and (d) ends up actually being enough to remedy the harms that that’s meant to address?

The first thing I would say is the scenario that you just outlined I would argue is not reparations. That’s a bribe. This is why it’s so crucial that it not just be a question of the money but it actually be a question of some sort of attempt to alter how we remember the past. If that goal were accomplished, you would not have a critical mass of Americans and white Americans wanting to wash their hands of it. They would see it as part of who they were and part of their responsibility. The notion, for instance, of reparations being paid out presumes something that happens over a one-year period or something and everybody walks away. I don’t think that’s what you’ll most likely see. First of all, you would most likely see a very decentralized process. I think the responsibility for instance, of elite universities would be very different than responsibility for the deprivations that the GI Bill did or the responsibilities of certain towns where black folks were basically forced to evacuate and leave under threat of being killed. You would see a suite of policies as opposed to a single unitary policy. In fact, this is actually what happened with reparations coming out of the Holocaust. There was no single, solitary act of reparation. There were several, actually, that are ongoing to this day, by the way. I mean, think about that. The end of WWII was 1945. Almost 75 years ago, man. Reparations are still being paid out for the detaining of Japanese-American citizens in this country. Well, the period of redlining is more recent than that. My hope would be there would be a profound reimagining not just of the African-American past and what was done to African-Americans in America and thus the American past in itself, but our responsibilities and how we deal with people in general.

Some of the criticism your work has faced on the left is that you overstate racism’s intrinsic nature in a way that casts it as this elemental force that will be with us forever. It’s baked into the soil we walk on, the air we breathe. Is this a fair assessment of your belief?

No, it’s not a fair assessment, and in defense of leftist critics, I love you, Zak, but I don’t even know if that’s a fair rendition of their criticism.

Do you not? Maybe I’m reading the wrong people.

No, you’ve probably read more than I have. So maybe it is. No, I think it’s totally wrong.

I do think that it’s easily taken away from your work that you believe, at the very least, that the work that needs to be done to end white supremacy in America is an almost, if not totally, insurmountable task because of how committed we are historically and culturally to that idea.

So is white supremacy insurmountable? Can we boil it down to that?

Yeah, let’s put it that way.

No, I would never say that. I think what I said in Between the World and Me is that it’s likely to be with us through the rest of this country’s history. I do believe that’s quite likely.

Can you pick apart what’s different about those two?

I mean, insurmountable implies a kind of certainty. Look, anti-Semitism is what, 2,000 years old, 2,000-plus years old, whatever? Can Europe say it’s free of anti-Semitism? After two millennia of struggle with it?

No, not at all.

So what fucking right does America, or even us who are doing the work here in America, have to presume that we most certainly will be free someday of racism? That’s what I object to. Because I think you deeply understate the challenge that’s faced. This is a country that would not exist without slavery.

It’s in the bones, do you understand what I’m saying? It’s in the economies, it’s in the cultures, it’s in the politics, it’s everywhere. So, just to stick with this example of anti-Semitism, note that the greatest crime of anti-Semitism happened almost 2,000 years into the history of it. So I don’t think that it’s crazy to say that when you’re looking at our country, for some 250 years, a quarter of a millennia, it tolerated the enslavement of people. It tolerated the doctrines that justified that enslavement. It tolerated the culture, it tolerated the politics. Then what followed was an era of pogroms, of Jim Crow, of massacres, of death, of robbery, of raping. And what followed that? An era of mass incarceration where we built the largest prison state ever known to man and we built it on the basis of racism and white supremacy. Dude, this is huge. What good does it do a doctor to act like cancer isn’t a big deal just because he hopes for a cure?

One thing I’ve heard repeatedly from activists I’ve talked to is the need to believe victory is possible.

They’re not wrong. They just have a different job than I have.

Do you think they’re deluded, though?

No, I wouldn’t say that, either. I would never say that.

Is your stance that it’s sort of an unknowable?

When I came to New York City, I wanted to be a writer who could support his family and take care of his family, whose work people respected. I was a college dropout. I had an 11-month-old child. I had no discernible income. The only income in my house was made by my then-partner, now wife, who was making about $29,000 a year. We were living in the basement of a brownstone. If it was somebody’s job to assess, do you think this guy is going to become this celebrated writer? And he said no, I couldn’t really be mad at them for doing that. Now me, myself, who’s out here in the struggle at that time? I had to believe in myself. I had to believe in that beyond whatever empirical evidence might’ve been there in the first place. I know this is a bit of a tortured metaphor. What I’m trying to say is, people who are actually out there doing the work, I understand why they need to believe.

It's official: Mike Bloomberg is running for president. And he is about to spend millions of dollars to tout the millions of dollars he has already spent combating President Trump and the coal industry.

The former New York mayor, who is one of the richest people in the world, entered the crowded 2020 Democratic primary on Sunday after weeks of teasing a self-financed campaign. He unrolled a multipronged pitch to voters that included trumpeting his extensive environmental philanthropy since stepping down as mayor in 2013.

In a campaign video released Sunday previewing the issues he will focus on in the race, a narrator notes how Bloomberg both “stood up to the coal lobby” and to “the outright denial of this administration” on climate change.

Those lines appear to refer to at least two past spending endeavors by Bloomberg: The more than $100 million he put into the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign to press for the closure of coal plants, and a grant of nearly $6 million in 2017 into a New York University School of Law center helping state attorneys general challenge the Trump administration's rollback of environmental rules.

When it comes to campaigning for the Democratic nomination, that spending is both a blessing and a curse. Bloomberg has real bona fides in the environmental movement for his philanthropy, but his candidacy comes at a moment when many Democratic voters are deeply skeptical of the power billionaires wield in politics.

To that point: Bloomberg's campaign team is dropping more than $30 million to reserve television advertising to launch his last-minute bid. That sum is on top of his jaw-dropping $100 million ad campaign in key battleground states targeting Trump exclusively.

One of Bloomberg's rivals, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said in a statement he was ""disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections.""

Bloomberg has butted heads with the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party before. When Barack Obama was in office, he irked some environmentalists by praising natural gas as a “bridge fuel” between coal and renewable sources. And more recently, he criticized Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-N.Y.) Green New Deal as politically unrealistic.

So far, the Bloomberg campaign has focused on what the former mayor has already done on climate change — not what he would do if president. Bloomberg's newly refurbished campaign website claims his data-driven mayoral administration reduced New York's carbon footprint by 14 percent, planted 800,000 trees and added 850 acres to parks.

— Trump vs. California: Environmental groups have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the move to rescind California’s waiver to set its own vehicle emissions standards.

Their argument: “EPA doesn’t have the authority to withdraw a waiver, and, even if it did, none of the justifications put forth stand up to scrutiny,” Mike Landis, an attorney for Environment America, said in a statement. Environment America was one of 11 groups to file the lawsuit alongside the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and others. The lawsuit follows a similar legal action from California and other states.

— EPA bans consumer use of chemical found in paint stripper: The Environmental Protection Agency’s ban on consumer sales of methylene chloride, a toxic chemical used in paint and coating strippers, went into effect on Saturday. Numerous major retailers, including Walmart, Home Depot and Lowes, have already banned products containing the chemical. “EPA’s action keeps paint and coating removers that contain the chemical methylene chloride out of consumers’ hands,” EPA chief Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. “It is against the law to sell or distribute methylene chloride for paint and coating removal in the retail marketplace — a step that will provide important public health protections for consumers.”

— Rick Perry avoiding the heat: The energy secretary is preparing to step down from his post on Dec. 1, but amid the House impeachment inquiry, he has declined to cooperate with a congressional subpoena and has so far avoided tough questions, CNN reports.

“Key questions about what he knew and when have gone unanswered, and Perry's aides appear to have shielded him on multiple occasions from questions about revelations in this week's testimony,” per the report. "" … Perry avoided reporters' questions at two speeches he delivered earlier in the week. When he spoke to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, Energy Department officials shielded him from reporters by sending what appeared to be an empty decoy SUV driven by his security officers to the building's front door while Perry slipped through a different door.”

As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts.

AD

Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.

“I literally had someone say, ‘How are you going to beat Donald Trump with love, Cory?’ ” he said after an event Friday in New Hampshire, placing himself in the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. “And I laughed. You don’t know our history! That’s how we always win! King said, ‘Darkness can’t drive out darkness; only love can do that.’”

AD

Everywhere Booker goes these days — in press gaggles and at candidate forums, in Iowa church pews and New Hampshire town halls — he is followed by questions about why his bid is still stuck in the low single digits.

AD

The senator from New Jersey’s stock answer is that he just needs more time, a few more donors — “Please go to corybooker.com,” he pleaded at the last debate — and the wisdom to remember that past Democratic nominees Barack Obama and John Kerry were trailing at this point in their primary campaigns.

But in moments of candor, he can be more reflective. “This is the challenge,” he told one loyal volunteer last month who had asked at a town hall in West Des Moines what more she could do to get his name out there.

AD

He even betrayed some frustration at the debate last week about his ability to break through. “I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage,” he said, in a dig at the attention that has been drawn to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The broader dilemma he faces has bedeviled more than a dozen campaigns this cycle. Those out of the top tier struggle as they seek even minimal attention, and without attention they cannot reach the top tier.

AD

“Until voting starts, the way voters can determine viability is through things like fundraising, polling and earned-media coverage,” said Meredith Kelly, a Democratic strategist who advised the short-lived campaign of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). “And if you aren’t considered worthy of going viral, worthy of being a top-tier candidate by cable news and big donors, then it becomes this self-fulfilling cycle.”

Booker’s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, told The Washington Post that Booker’s success has often been unfairly contrasted with the high expectations set by a political establishment that long saw him as a rising star.

“We have a high bar to clear,” he said Saturday. “And the reality is he’s been clearing it, particularly in the early states. But the metric that the press has been paying the most attention to is polling — not endorsements, not favorability, not consideration. We’re winning by those metrics. It’s only the horse race that we’re not winning, yet.”

AD

Booker’s campaign message, a departure from the rest of the pack, has so far failed to overcome the challenge, although he says he has attracted a devoted following. His fundraising jumped after Wednesday’s debate — his campaign anticipated it will have collected $1 million by the end of the weekend — and he points to relatively high favorability in recent Democratic polls.

His announcement video, scored to a drum-line beat, showed him walking the graffiti-strewn streets of Newark, yelling “What’s up?” to a passerby. An early endorser of Medicare-for-all, he has campaigned on legalizing marijuana and expunging the records of the mostly nonwhite Americans with minor drug convictions.

This was a departure from the more buttoned-up approach he took in his first Senate campaign, a 2013 special election, in which he ran ads that showed him in a suit and tie, speaking in glass-walled conference rooms, with graphics about bringing in “new business” and a voice-over that promised innovation and to “reach for new answers.” As a senator, he has been known as a more moderate Democrat, earning financial support from former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, supporting charter schools and voting against a bill to encourage the importation of drugs from Canada.

AD

As a presidential candidate, by contrast, he has more closely identified with the struggles of urban populations. Like Sen.Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and former housing secretary Julián Castro, Booker has argued that the party needs to focus on black voters to increase turnout in cities like Detroit and Philadelphia in the general election. But the positioning has yet to earn any of them a spike in support among black voters, who continue to back former vice president Joe Biden in polls.

AD

Interviews with black voters in South Carolina found high praise for Booker’s message. But those same voters repeatedly stopped short of supporting him.

“He may be eloquent and he may be educated, but will they vote for him?” asked Wilma Doyle, 74, a retired schoolteacher from Greenville who said she likes almost everything about Booker. “He is good, but I don’t think he has the best chance.”

AD

David Gaston, 75, a Vietnam veteran from Greenwood, said he likes Booker personally, but still ranks Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) ahead of him in his preference for a nominee.

“Sometimes, you’ve got to fight. When you’re in a war, you’ve got to fight,” Gaston said. “Biden has the knowledge of how the world works. Elizabeth Warren is a fighter.”

AD

Booker has approached the campaign, instead, as a moment for national inspiration and spiritual rebirth.

“Love is not sentimentality,” Booker said Friday at a University of New Hampshire town hall in Durham. “Love is service. Love is sacrifice. Love is saying, ‘Hey, if your kids don’t have a great public school to go to, my kids are lesser off.’ Love says that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”

He hugged an audience member for asking a question about poverty.

AD

To make the cut for the December debate, Booker will need to score 4 percent or higher in four party-sanctioned polls over the coming weeks. He has so far failed to reach that level in any party-sanctioned poll published since mid-October.

AD

Even if he does not make the cut, he has vowed to continue his campaign, with a pathway that remains focused on Iowa. He has devoted significant resources to the first-voting state, hiring an early statewide staff of 50, including several aides who got tattoos of the slogan “We Rise” in Booker’s handwriting.

“Booker could actually do incredibly well here. He has a great organization, has a great staff. They’ve got great endorsements,” said Grant Woodard, a Des Moines attorney and former Democratic strategist who is unaffiliated in the race. “But there’s just so much noise with all these other candidates running.”

AD

At his second New Hampshire event Friday, 125 people overflowed a brewery in downtown Portsmouth, where organizers had planned for 50 people.

After Booker finished speaking, Greg Norris, a marketing executive, hung in the back of the event space with a beer as his 18-year-old son waited in line for a selfie with the senator.

“I think his message of inclusion is right on,” Norris said about his first time seeing Booker. “I’m very surprised that he hasn’t gotten the traction. When you look at just the qualifications, the way he speaks, a level of intelligence, the education, the experience, I’m really surprised, relative to the other candidates.”

But Norris still wasn’t sold. He said he was not yet ready to say he would vote for Booker."

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: What makes America exceptional isn’t any arsenal. It’s moral authority.

That’s the upshot of Richard V. Spencer’s Sunday letter to President Trump, acknowledging his “termination” as secretary of the navy. The messy circumstances surrounding Spencer’s exit should not overshadow another damning resignation letter from another Trump appointee.

Spencer explained that he has strived over two-plus years on the job to ensure judicial proceedings are “fair, transparent and consistent,” from ensigns to admirals. “Unfortunately, it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline,” he wrote. “I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

His language goes further than Jim Mattis’s letter last December when he resigned as secretary of defense to protest Trump ordering U.S. troops to withdraw from Syria, but there are echoes. Both Spencer and Mattis said Trump deserves someone whose views are better aligned with his own.

Spencer was ousted over his efforts to resolve a dispute between the White House and Navy commanders who wanted to strip Edward Gallagher of the Trident pin that makes him a Navy SEAL. Gallagher’s was one of three cases in the military justice system that Trump intervened in 10 days ago. The chief petty officer was accused of committing war crimes during a 2017 deployment in Iraq. He was acquitted of murder but convicted in July of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State prisoner. Trump reinstated Gallagher’s rank after he was demoted as part of his punishment. The president tweeted on Thursday that he doesn’t want Gallagher, who has become a cause celebre on Fox News, kicked out of the SEALs.

“The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries,” Spencer told Trump, offering a brief history lesson. “Good order and discipline is what has enabled our victory against foreign tyranny time and again, from Captain Lawrence's famous order ‘Don't Give up the Ship,' to the discipline and determination that propelled our flag to the highest point on Iwo Jima. The Constitution, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, are the shields that set us apart, and the beacons that protect us all.”

-- Disdain for the rule of law has been a recurring feature of Trumpism.

-- Spencer, 65, served in the Marines as an aviator from 1976 to 1981, separating as a captain, before making a fortune on Wall Street. He has been secretary of the Navy since the Senate confirmed him in August 2017. In his letter, he praised the troops who will soon miss their Thanksgiving dinners at home so that they can continue the watch beyond the curve of the horizon.

“As Secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks,” Spencer wrote. “I regard this as deadly serious business. The lives of our Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates quite literally depend on the professional execution of our many missions, and they also depend on the ongoing faith and support of the people we serve and the allies we serve alongside.”

-- Pentagon spokespeople said Defense Secretary Mark Esper asked for Spencer’s resignation after losing confidence in him. Their explanation is that Esper became “deeply troubled” when he discovered Spencer was backchanneling with the White House to offer a secret deal in which a review board would decide to let Gallagher keep his Trident pin – and affiliation with the SEALs – if Trump didn’t directly meddle in the official peer-review process, thereby maintaining the appearance of independence.

-- “Spencer had tried to find a compromise,” David Ignatius reports in his column, “after Trump tweeted Thursday, ‘The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin.’ Spencer feared that a direct order from Trump to protect Gallagher, who is represented by two former partners of Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, would be seen as subverting military justice. After that Trump tweet, Spencer cautioned acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney that he would not overturn the planned SEAL peer review of Gallagher without a direct presidential order; he privately told associates that if such an order came, he might resign rather than carry it out. …

“‘It was a hold-your-nose solution,’ said a source close to Spencer about his effort to broker an arrangement that would allow Gallagher to retire at the end of November with his former rank, an honorable discharge and his Trident pin, as Trump wanted, but without direct presidential interference in the SEAL review process. As so often happens with attempts to work with Trump’s erratic demands, this one ended in disaster. ‘The president wants you to go,’ Esper told Spencer on Sunday … Esper then toed the White House line and announced Spencer’s dismissal. …

“Trump began lobbying Spencer to exempt Gallagher from Navy discipline back in March, when he ordered the Navy secretary in an early-morning phone call to release Gallagher from the brig and give him more comfortable quarters. Presidential pressure has been relentless, ever since. … While Gallagher is celebrated on Fox, current and former senior officers of the SEALs and other elite units told me this weekend that his case has little support within the community of Special Operations forces. One former SEAL commander noted that maintaining discipline among these elite units is so important that the SEAL peer-review panels have removed more than 150 Trident pins since 2011, or more than one a month.”

-- Trump now gets the outcome he wanted: Esper’s aides said he will let Gallagher keep his Trident pin without even the pretense of a review board. And Trump has rid himself of someone he came to disregard as disloyal, based on his threat to resign.

-- Spencer joins a growing list of former Trump appointees who have spoken critically, to varying degrees, about the president after leaving his employ. This includes, among others, John Bolton, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Tom Bossert, Fiona Hill and Gary Cohn.

-- Spencer took the sting out of this punch by vigorously denying well-sourced press reports on Saturday that he had threatened to resign. In the version of his letter distributed to media outlets last night, the date “24 Nov 19” has been scrawled by hand on the top right of a letter that was reportedly drafted last week. The denial of accurate media accounts muddies the narrative around the secretary’s departure.

-- This appears to be the coda of a contentious chapter in a civilian-military relationship that has grown increasingly fraught. Trump avoided military service by claiming bone spurs. He has stated that avoiding sexually transmitted infections while bedding models in New York during the 1970s was “my personal Vietnam.” Trump has insulted several war heroes, as well as their families, and never apologized.

-- The top U.S. military officer voiced public support today for Esper’s decision to allow Gallagher to remain a Navy SEAL and to fire Spencer. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s case closed now,” Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters traveling with him in the Middle East, including Missy Ryan. “It’s time to move on and address the national security of the United States. … Esper made decisions for good reasons that are within his power. I’ll support the secretary of defense in those decisions.”

-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he spoke by phone with Spencer on Sunday night: “I told him he’s a patriot, that he served the Navy and the nation well and he will be missed,” Schumer said in a statement. “Secretary Spencer did the right thing and he should be proud of standing up to President Trump when he was wrong, something too many in this administration and the Republican Party are scared to do. Good order, discipline, and morale among the Armed Services must transcend politics, and Secretary Spencer’s commitment to these principles will not be forgotten.”

-- Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Trump notified him personally that Spencer was being fired. “Both Secretary Esper and President Trump deserve to have a leadership team who has their trust and confidence,” Inhofe said in a statement, adding: “It is no secret that I had my own disagreements with Secretary Spencer over the management of specific Navy programs.”

-- Other lawmakers offered praise for Spencer:

I worked very closely with him on expanding our Naval fleet, strengthening both our public and private shipyards, and supporting our troops. His departure is a great loss to the Department of Defense and our country. (2/2) — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) November 25, 2019

As we often find from this White House, there are multiple “official” versions of the secretary of the Navy’s departure. In every telling, though, President Trump undermines military discipline and the Rule of Law with his words and actions. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) November 25, 2019

-- Trump tweeted that he will nominate Kenneth Braithwaite, a retired Navy rear admiral who is currently the ambassador to Norway, to be Spencer’s replacement. Esper recommended him.

-- In an interview Sunday morning on “Fox & Friends,” Gallagher said the Navy was only trying to take his Trident pin away as “retaliation” for Trump intervening on his behalf. “They could have taken my Trident at any time they wanted,” he said on a show the president often watches. “Now they're trying to take it after the president restored my rank.” Speaking of Rear Adm. Collin Green, who is in charge of the SEAL program as commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command, Gallagher said: “What the admiral is doing is showing complete insubordination.”

-- Ray Mabus, who served as Navy secretary under Barack Obama, said on MSNBC that he’s been stunned that a sailor on active duty is going on cable television to criticize his commanding officers. “It's so dangerous for good order and discipline … to get this politicized,” Mabus said Sunday on MSNBC. “You simply cannot have good order and discipline. You simply cannot hold people accountable. You simply cannot have the elite fighting force if you allow things like this to happen. If you set this sort of precedent, then how do you tell the next SEAL that is up on charges not to go public, not to try to undermine their superiors, not to try to change a military judgment and make it a political one?”

-- The Post’s Editorial Board says Trump’s intervention in the Gallagher case, including Spencer’s ouster, dishonors the troops who uphold American values: “Restoring to service someone who was turned in by members of his unit who wouldn’t tolerate his behavior sends precisely the wrong message. … Most offensive is what Mr. Trump’s actions say about his view of the military. ‘We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!,’ he tweeted in October when he announced he would review these cases. Perhaps Mr. Trump has watched too many bad war movies, but if he were to consult with his military leaders or talk to the many fine men and women in uniform, they would tell him they are trained to engage in combat while following the laws of war and upholding the country’s ideals.”

QUOTE OF THE DAY: A lawyer for Gallagher, Tim Parlatore, welcomed last night’s news and expressed amazement at the turn of events that led to Spencer’s ouster. “This case is bananas,” he said. ""Yes, you can quote that.” (Ashley Parker and Dan Lamothe)

THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:

-- A confidential White House review of Trump’s decision to place a hold on military aid to Ukraine has turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, according to three people familiar with the records. Josh Dawsey, Carol D. Leonnig and Tom Hamburger scoop: “The research by the White House Counsel’s Office … includes early August email exchanges between acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House budget officials seeking to provide an explanation for withholding the funds after the president had already ordered a hold in mid-July on the nearly $400 million in security assistance … White House lawyers are expressing concern that the review has turned up some unflattering exchanges and facts that could at a minimum embarrass the president. …

“In the early August email exchanges, Mulvaney asked acting OMB director Russell Vought for an update on the legal rationale for withholding the aid and how much longer it could be delayed. Trump had made the decision the prior month without an assessment of the reasoning or legal justification … Emails show Vought and OMB staffers arguing that withholding aid was legal, while officials at the National Security Council and State Department protested. OMB lawyers said that it was legal to withhold the aid, as long as they deemed it a ‘temporary’ hold …

“Mulvaney’s request for information came days after the White House Counsel’s Office was put on notice that an anonymous CIA official had made a complaint to the agency’s general counsel about Trump’s July 25 call to [Volodymyr] Zelensky … This official would later file a whistleblower complaint with the intelligence community’s inspector general …

“The document research has only exacerbated growing tension between [White House Counsel Pat] Cipollone and Mulvaney and their offices, with Cipollone tightly controlling access to his findings, and Mulvaney’s aides complaining Cipollone isn’t briefing other White House officials or sharing important material they need to respond to public inquiries … The emails revealed by White House lawyers include some in which Mulvaney urges Vought to immediately focus on Ukraine’s aid package, making clear it was a top priority for the administration. [Mulvaney’s lawyer, Robert Driscoll, declined to comment.]

“The legal office launched this fact-finding review of internal records in a protective mode, both to determine what the records might reveal about internal administration conversations and also to help the White House produce a timeline for defending Trump’s decision and his public comments. Along with examining documents, the review has also involved interviewing some key White House officials involved in handling Ukraine aid and dealing with complaints and concerns in the aftermath of the call between Trump and Zelensky. Cipollone’s office has focused closely on correspondence that could be subject to public records requests, those which involve discussions between staff at the White House and at other agencies. Internal White House records are not subject to federal public records law, but messages that include officials at federal agencies are.”

-- Follow the money: Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the Rudy Giuliani associates who have been indicted, tried to recruit a Ukrainian energy executive to join them in a proposed takeover of the state oil-and-gas company. From the Wall Street Journal: The two men described the “company’s chief executive and [Marie Yovanovitch] as part of ‘this Soros cartel’ working against [Trump.] ‘You’re a Republican, right?’ Andrew Favorov, the head of natural gas for state-run Naftogaz, recalled the men … asking him, after their reference to investor and Democratic donor George Soros. ‘We want you to be our guy.’ … Mr. Favorov described the efforts of Messrs. Fruman and Parnas to enlist his help in an effort to oust Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev. Naftogaz is the most important company in Ukraine, representing nearly 10% of the country’s gross domestic product and supplying virtually all of the country’s natural gas. Mr. Favorov said he was bewildered by Messrs. Parnas and Fruman’s pitch to stage a takeover of Naftogaz and put Mr. Favorov in place as CEO. On one hand, the pair appeared to know little about the natural gas business; on the other it was clear to him they had significant political connections. ‘They don’t teach you how to deal with this in business school,’ Mr. Favorov said.”

-- So many potential conflicts: Giuliani also discussed representing a state-owned Ukrainian bank in a legal dispute over the summer, even as he publicly pressed Ukraine on behalf of Trump. From Bloomberg News: “Though he ultimately did not take on the client, the talks expose his enthusiasm for foreign business and his willingness to insert himself in matters rife with potential conflicts. In fact, the Ukrainian bank is entangled in a legal dispute with its former owner who has ties to Ukraine’s president and is the subject of a federal investigation in the U.S. … [Giuliani] said he was approached by lawyers for Privatbank seeking to recover assets linked to the previous owner. They wanted to know if Giuliani -- who had written tweets critical of the man -- could assist their civil suit, Giuliani confirmed by phone on Thursday.”

-- “What we still don’t know about the Ukraine affair,” by deputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl: “Let’s start with the distinct possibility that Trump’s demand that [Zelensky] launch politicized investigations in exchange for military aid and a White House meeting was only the last of a series of quid pro quos he forced on Ukrainians.” Giuliani met with Zelensky’s predecessor at least twice in 2017 as Ukraine’s former chief prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko transferred an investigation into secret payments to Paul Manafort, effectively stalling it, and the U.S. released the sale of Jaevelin missiles to Ukraine. “Let’s see: a White House meeting and weapons ... for favorable actions on an investigation? There’s no proof. But no wonder Trump complained to Zelensky in their July 25 phone call that ‘I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair.’ One of Zelensky’s first acts had been to fire Lutsenko.

“The prosecutor has also been blamed for Trump’s recall of [Yovanovitch]. But the full story behind her dismissal is still not known. … Trump began demanding Yovanovitch’s removal a year earlier, after meeting with [Parnas and ­Fruman]. Why did Parnas and Fruman want the ambassador out? It’s still not clear. … One person who probably could shed light on this is Rick Perry. … According to testimony by U.S. Embassy staffer David Holmes, Perry used a meeting with Zelensky to give him a list of ‘people he trusts’ on energy matters. The Times reported that these included a couple of Texas businessmen whom Perry wanted appointed to the supervisory board of the Ukrainian state gas company. That’s the same company Parnas and Fruman were trying to deal with. … We may eventually learn more about Ukraine from federal prosecutors in New York, who have already indicted Parnas and Fruman and are said to be looking at Giuliani. But you have to wonder if Democrats are making a mistake by not pursuing these matters themselves.”

-- Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said reports that he met with ex-Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in Vienna to obtain information about the Bidens were false. Elise Viebeck and Felicia Sonmez report: “The allegation … was made by the attorney for [Parnas]. … On Fox News, Nunes declined to answer further questions about the accusation ... A person close to Shokin also has denied the claim. … Nunes has also threatened to sue two of the news outlets that reported Parnas’s accusation. On Fox News, Nunes claimed that CNN and the Daily Beast were ‘likely conspiring to obstruct justice’ by basing their reporting on interviews with a lawyer for Parnas. ... House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said Saturday that it was ‘quite likely, without question’ that Nunes would face an ethics investigation following media reports of a meeting with Shokin. … Several other Democratic lawmakers have said that Parnas’s testimony could be helpful to impeachment investigators or that Nunes should face an ethics probe.”

-- Lordy, there are tapes? Parnas has provided the House Intelligence Committee with audio, photos and video recordings, but what these records show is unclear. From ABC News: “[The] tapes were provided as part of that congressional subpoena issued to Parnas, and the former Giuliani ally also provided a number of documents both in English and Ukrainian to the committee in two separate productions … However, some of the material sought by congressional investigators is already in possession of federal investigators within the Southern District of New York and thus held up from being turned over, according to sources familiar with the matter.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said his panel will press ahead with preparing its impeachment report, even though several key witnesses have refused to testify. Felicia Sonmez and Elise VIebeck report: “In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’ … Several key figures, including [Mulvaney], Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former national security adviser John Bolton and [Giuliani], have declined to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. A federal judge is expected to rule [today] on whether [former White House counsel Don McGahn] must testify under subpoena. …

""Schiff said Sunday that time is of the essence and that Democrats will continue to investigate even after they have submitted their report to the House Judiciary Committee. ... 'The investigation isn’t going to end,’ he said, adding that ‘we may have other depositions and hearings to do.’ He took particular aim at Bolton, arguing that the former national security adviser will have to explain why he chose to give his account of events ‘in a book’ rather than show the ‘courage’ that Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council Russia adviser, did in testifying before lawmakers last week. Schiff declined to say how long it might take impeachment investigators to finish their report, saying only that ‘we’ll take the time that’s necessary.’”

-- Amid tensions between the Trump administration and Democrats, Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin must work out a spending deal. Luckily, they appear to maintain a good rapport. From the Journal: “While the Office of Management and Budget leads the administration’s efforts on spending, Mr. Mnuchin has emerged as the public face of the administration on Capitol Hill in the spending talks, which took a positive turn this weekend even as impeachment strains the broader relationship between the two branches. Mr. Mnuchin’s role speaks to the rapport and goodwill he has built up with lawmakers and, in particular, Mrs. Pelosi ... Mrs. Pelosi has clashed with two of the administration’s other top negotiators, [Mulvaney] and [Vought], with whom she refused to negotiate last summer’s budget deal. … House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D., Ky.) said … that Mr. Mulvaney would normally play a more visible role in the negotiations, ‘but I think Mick, he has other distractions.’”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Hong Kong’s pro-democracy parties swept aside the pro-Beijing establishment during local council elections in a significant endorsement of the protest movement that’s shaken the territory. Shibani Mahtani, Simon Denyer, Tiffany Liang and Anna Kam report: “Voters took to the polls in record numbers to cast ballots in the only fully democratic election in the Chinese territory, an early sign that they wanted to send a strong message to their government and to the Communist Party in Beijing. Early results compiled by the South China Morning Post showed pro-democracy parties winning 278 of the first 344 seats to be declared, pro-Beijing parties taking 42, and independents 24. Many prominent figures in the protest movement won, and many leading pro-establishment figures were unseated. Pro-democrats look to be able to secure 12 of 18 district councils available in Hong Kong — before this vote, they did not have a majority in any. … The turnout — 2.94 million, or more than 71 percent of the 4.13 million eligible voters — was more than double the 1.4 million who voted in local elections in 2015. Voter registration was also a record high, driven in part by 390,000 first-time voters.”

-- The election’s results will pressure Beijing to rethink its approach. Shibani, Simon and Tiffany report: “With this rebuke of its affiliates in the city, Beijing faces a choice among opening up politics as promised in Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, extending a crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters by the city’s police force and government, or trying to navigate a delicate middle path. Beijing can continue to dig in, but it would risk escalating and prolonging the conflict now that the electorate has spoken, said Ho-Fung Hung, an expert on the Chinese political economy and Hong Kong politics at the Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. …. Reacting to the outcome on Monday, Chinese state media accused foreign forces, particularly the United States, of interfering. … [Carrie] Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled leader, said in a statement Monday that her government respects the election results and acknowledged ‘various analyses and interpretations.’ … Susan Shirk, a China expert and former official in the Clinton administration who is now at the University of California at San Diego, said it was possible that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had not been receiving accurate information from lower-level officials on the public dissatisfaction in Hong Kong, despite months of protests.”

-- A growing body of evidence from former detainees, human rights groups and reporters details the Chinese government’s efforts to detain more than 1 million ethnic minorities in camps. Hannah Knowles, Kim Bellware and Lateshia Beachum report: “Papers released Sunday pierce a culture of intense secrecy to add a new piece of corroboration: the government’s own classified directives. Provided to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by an anonymous source, the documents lay bare a crackdown in Xinjiang that has sought to stamp out minority culture, language and religion — with a particular focus on the Muslim Uighurs, whom the government blames for regional unrest. A manual, the first of its kind to be made public, details the inner workings of the three-year-old detention camps, while four intelligence briefings illuminate the mass surveillance that identifies people for internment on merely the suspicion that they may cause trouble. …

“Camps are heavily secured and full of surveillance, according to the manual signed by Zhu Hailun, who used to be in charge of security in Xinjiang. … Some communication with outsiders is allowed to put family ‘at ease.’ Detainees are supposed to have phone conversations with relatives at least once a week and video chats every month.”

-- A “phase two” trade deal between the U.S. and China is looking less likely. From Reuters: “Officials in Beijing say they don’t anticipate sitting down to discuss a phase two deal before the U.S. election, in part because they want to wait to see if Trump wins a second term. ‘It’s Trump who wants to sign these deals, not us. We can wait,’ one Chinese official told Reuters…. Trump’s main priority at the moment is to secure a big phase one announcement, locking in big-ticket Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods that he can tout as an important win during his re-election campaign, according to a Trump administration official.”

-- Pope Francis called for the abolition of nuclear weapons while visiting Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Akiko Kashiwagi and Chico Harlan report: “Pope Francis called Sunday for a ‘world without nuclear weapons,’ which he said are ‘immoral’ for war or deterrence. ‘We will be judged on this,’ Francis said. In Hiroshima, the pope met with bomb survivors and spoke vividly of the ‘black hole of death and destruction’ atomic weapons could cause. Earlier, in a somber address in Nagasaki delivered in the driving rain, he spoke about the weapons in policy terms and expressed concern that a ‘climate of distrust’ was endangering international arms control efforts. … Francis used the first papal trip to Japan since 1981 to emphasize one of his signature issues in cities that remain lasting symbols of atomic destruction (though both have been fully rebuilt in the decades since the 1945 attacks). … After laying a wreath to the Nagasaki bombing’s victims, the pope said the arms race creates a false sense of security, poisoning international relationships. He described nuclear weapons as wasteful and environmentally damaging. ... By saying that weapons shouldn’t be held for deterrence — a stance he first outlined in 2017 — Francis has gone further than his predecessors. The only other pope to visit Japan, John Paul II, said during the Cold War that deterrence could be 'morally acceptable,' so long as it was a step toward disarmament.""

-- A couple kidnapped by Islamists was rescued in the Philippines during a military operation. Regine Cabato reports: “Allan Hyrons, 71, and Wilma Hyrons, 59, were abducted last month by Abu Sayyaf fighters at a beach resort the couple owned in the southern Philippines. They were rescued around 8 a.m. Monday in the island province of Sulu after a 20-minute firefight, said regional military commander Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, who attributed the operation’s success to support from the public. … The rescue of the Hyrons came at the end of a three-day operation, which the military said left six militant fighters dead.”

-- The White House asked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to block the resolution that would have formally recognized Turkey’s genocide of the Armenian people. From Axios: Graham was leaving the Oval Office after he joined a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan when a senior White House staff asked him to object on the floor to the resolution that had passed the House to avoid upsetting Erdogan. ""Graham confirmed this in a phone interview on Saturday. ... A White House legislative affairs official told Graham that Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) was going to bring up his Armenian genocide resolution and asked if Graham could ‘please object.’ ‘I said sure,’ Graham said. ‘The only reason I did it is because he [Erdoğan] was still in town. ... That would've been poor timing. I'm trying to salvage the relationship if possible.’ Asked whether he felt uncomfortable blocking the Armenian genocide resolution, Graham replied: ‘Yeah. ... I'm not going to object next time,’ Graham added."" The White House prodded Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) to object the next time, and he obliged.

-- Threatening more arrests, Iran restored Internet access in large parts of the country after a weeklong shutdown aimed at nationwide protests. From the Journal: “Tehran’s response to the unrest indicates its willingness to resort to deadly force to push back against what it sees as U.S. attempts to weaken and eventually oust the country’s leaders. It also comes amid a growing pushback in the region, where Iraqi and Lebanese protesters have railed against the influence of Iran and its local allies. … Iranian authorities haven't released an official number of arrests, but state media said authorities had arrested 180 ‘ringleaders’ and ‘rioters’ connected with such disparate groups as Islamic State, the MeK and Kurdish militants. Iran’s internet blackout stemmed the sharing of videos and photos of the demonstrations, helping contain coverage to inside Iran, while making it difficult for those outside the country to assess the state of the protests and the brutal crackdown.”

-- Reuters chronicles the role Iran’s leaders had in plotting the September attacks on the world’s biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. “This account [was] described to Reuters by three officials familiar with the meetings and a fourth close to Iran’s decision making … These people said Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved the operation, but with strict conditions: Iranian forces must avoid hitting any civilians or Americans. … The plan by Iranian military leaders to strike Saudi oil installations developed over several months, according to the official close to Iran’s decision making. … The official close to Iran’s decision making said the group settled on the plan to attack Saudi Arabia’s oil installations because it could grab big headlines, inflict economic pain on an adversary and still deliver a strong message to Washington.”

-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces his first serious leadership challenge from his own party. Ruth Eglash reports: “The first public cracks in [Netanyahu]’s Likud party appeared over the weekend, days after the country’s attorney general indicted the longtime leader on charges of bribery and fraud in three criminal cases. The move comes after a year of political limbo that could send Israelis back to the polls for an unprecedented third general election in less than a year. Gideon Saar, Netanyahu’s most outspoken challenger within Likud, told an Israeli news show Saturday that it was time for the party to hold primaries to decide its leader and keep it from losing power. Saar, a 52-year-old former minister who returned to politics last year after a four-year hiatus, said he himself could end the political crisis. On Sunday, he submitted a request to the party’s central committee calling for a leadership vote to be held in the next three weeks — the deadline for the country’s lawmakers to form a long-elusive government before another general election must be called.”

-- Uber lost its license to operate in London after authorities discovered that more than 14,000 trips were taken with uninsured drivers. From the Guardian: “Transport for London announced the decision not to renew the global ride-hailing firm’s licence at the end of a two-month probationary extension granted in September. Uber was then told it needed to address issues with checks on drivers, insurance and safety, but has apparently failed to satisfy the capital’s transport authorities. … The decision is unlikely to see Uber cars disappear from London, as the firm is expected to appeal, and can continue to operate pending the outcome, provided it launches official proceedings within 21 days.”

-- Not only will England’s Prince Andrew stand aside from all of his 230 patronages after a scandalous interview about his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he also won’t be able to throw a birthday bash next year, under orders from the Queen. From the Guardian: “The blanket move represents a key step in Buckingham Palace’s attempts to limit the damage to the British monarchy from the prince’s association with Epstein and his interview with BBC Two’s Newsnight last weekend in which he was widely thought to have shown insufficient concern for Epstein’s victims. … Andrew’s withdrawal from public life coincides with Charles’s wish for a more streamlined and cost-effective monarchy when he becomes king. Sources close to the Prince of Wales, who is on an official visit to the Solomon Islands, denied reports that he was ‘angry and frustrated’ by the publicity his younger brother was attracting. It was also reported that the Queen has cancelled a planned 60th birthday party for Andrew in February and has downsized it to a small family gathering.”

-- A small plane crashed in eastern Congo, killing at least 27 people. From Reuters: “The propeller plane, which was operated by local company Busy Bee, crashed shortly after take-off en route to the city of Beni.""

2020 WATCH:

-- Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg officially announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Michael Scherer reports: “Bloomberg has promised a disruptive campaign that could break spending records with a massive advertising buy aimed at states that vote in March and April. … Without offering specifics, the announcement video says he will push for the wealthy to pay more in taxes and to guarantee health care to all Americans without removing private insurance from anyone who wants it. His campaign has made more than $30 million in television advertising reservations to help introduce him as a candidate. The ads will start [today]. … Bloomberg has also announced a $100 million ad campaign to criticize Trump in key battleground states and a $15 million voter registration effort in those same places. Those initial spending plans are already double the amount raised by the top fundraiser in the Democratic field, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), through September.”

-- The billionaire’s news outlet, Bloomberg News, announced it will stop writing unsigned editorials about its founder and its reporters will avoid investigating him or his Democratic rivals as long as he stays in the race. Paul Farhi reports: “In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations … Micklethwait’s memo Sunday laid out what he called ‘basic principles’ in covering Bloomberg’s political aspirations. Most notably, he said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’ A Bloomberg News spokeswoman, Kerri Chyka, also said the company won’t initiate stories about Bloomberg L.P., following a long-standing policy. The hands-off policy puts Bloomberg News in the awkward position of passing on such critical stories as Trump’s unfounded allegations of corruption against [Biden] and his son Hunter. At the same time, Micklethwait said Bloomberg News would continue to investigate the Trump administration.”

-- “America already elected a builder,” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said of Bloomberg’s announcement, which uses the tagline “Rebuild America.” “His new ad that he put millions behind is all unicorns and rainbows. Keep your health care if you'd like to — and if you don't, I have something better. Rebuild America. We heard that from Obama-Biden,” Conway said. (Politico)

-- Biden is struggling in Iowa and his supporters blame a lack of enthusiasm and a spotty campaign operation. From the Times: “Voters at Mr. Biden’s events, along with county chairs and party strategists, characterize his on-the-ground organization as scattershot, visibly present in some counties but barely detectable in others. His events are often relatively small and sometimes subdued affairs, and in a state where enthusiasm can make or break a candidate on caucus night — a big part of caucusing centers on persuading friends and neighbors — Mr. Biden’s operation has found it difficult to build contagious excitement, these Democrats say. … ‘This is prime political season in Iowa and most candidates are spending a good deal of time visiting Iowa,’ said Joey Norris, the Democratic chair in Montgomery County, Iowa, where [Pete] Buttigieg plans to campaign on Monday. ‘The Biden campaign has been notably absent.’”

-- Sanders’s loyal voters could keep him in the race for months. From the Journal: “Sanders’s campaign has made it clear that to win the nomination, he would have to pull off an ambitious expansion of the electorate. His campaign says it is banking on turning out a coalition of young, working-class and minority voters. But polls show the Vermont independent’s base is more loyal than that of any other 2020 Democrat, and in interviews over the last four months, Mr. Sanders’s supporters [have said] that they wouldn’t support any other candidate as long as he is running. Those backers—and his massive fundraising—mean that, unlike many of his rivals, Mr. Sanders might not need a marquee win in an early state to stay in the presidential race for months.”

-- Sen. Cory Booker keeps winning praise for his presidential campaign. What he’s not winning is much support. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Michael Scherer report: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”

-- Sarah Sanders left Washington less than six months ago. Now the former White House press secretary has returned to Arkansas in search for a new political role. From the Times: “‘There are two types of people who run for office,’ Ms. Sanders said over breakfast tacos at a diner in downtown Little Rock last week. ‘People that are called and people that just want to be a senator or governor. I feel like I’ve been called.’ ... As the daughter of Mike Huckabee, who served as governor from 1996 to 2007 and twice ran for president, she is seen as political royalty in Arkansas, and Mr. Trump himself urged her to run for governor when she left the West Wing. That job will open in 2023, when Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s term is up, and Ms. Sanders is giving every indication that she plans to run. …

“In the 23 months that Ms. Sanders served as Mr. Trump’s chief spokeswoman, her battles with the White House press corps were epic. … Ms. Sanders’s relationship with reporters reached a nadir in April after it was revealed that she had admitted under oath to investigators working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that her claim at a press briefing that ‘countless members of the F.B.I.’ told her they had lost confidence in the bureau’s director, James B. Comey, was a ‘slip of the tongue’ that was not based on any facts. … ‘I was attacked for everything, not just my performance,’ she said of her time in Washington. ‘I was called a fat soccer mom, my kids were threatened, my life was threatened. It was a lot. I hate harping on it, but to be in the position I’m in and to have Secret Service, that’s not normal.’ Ms. Sanders paused. ‘I don’t like being called a liar,’ she said.""

-- Doctors who previously worked at the White House and those who are currently in touch with the White House said the mysterious and unannounced visit Trump made to the hospital last weekend was highly unusual. From CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta: “Given that the White House had previously given plenty of advance notice about the President's past physical exams, last weekend's visit to Walter Reed reportedly took everyone by surprise, including much of the staff at the hospital itself. Whenever the President is planning a visit to Walter Reed, an institution-wide notice goes out, making staff aware of certain road and corridor closings. According to a person familiar with the matter, that didn't happen last weekend. Also striking: the fact that the president's physician, Dr. Sean Conley, rode with Trump in the presidential motorcade. Typically, the doctor rides separately from the President for security reasons. A former White House doctor [said] it had never happened during their time there. …

""All tests Conley described could've been performed at the White House instead of the hospital. Many blood tests require the patient to fast overnight and are thus performed first thing in the morning -- not in the middle of the afternoon, as apparently happened with the President. And remember, the President had these tests just nine months ago. One of the reasons doctors wait a year to order labs for a routine physical is to better assess the impact of medication and lifestyle changes over a consistent interval of time. There is no benefit to drawing the blood early, unless there is a concern about something. Finally, there is no such thing as a phased physical exam, as Trump had described it in his tweet from last weekend.”

-- Another health scare: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from the hospital on Sunday after going in with chills and a fever. Robert Barnes reports: “The court announced in a news release Saturday evening that the 86-year-old had been seen at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington and then transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where doctors were more familiar with her medical history. She was treated for a possible infection. 'With intravenous antibiotics and fluids, her symptoms have abated,' the court said in the Saturday release. The court provided no other details.”

One of the really unfortunate consequences of Donald Trump’s presidency isn’t an impeachable offense. But it has arguably deranged many political observers and regular voters who now believe his improbable election in 2016 has abolished every single rule of logic, history, and even common sense in terms of who might succeed him in office. The most obvious example of this anybody-can-win bender is the sudden belief of every other billionaire in this country that they ought to at least consider a presidential run. Two of them are actually in the race.

But another is the proliferation of asinine theories about which Trump challengers have a plausible rationale for candidacy, or who might (as the saying always goes) strike fear into the hearts of the president and his cronies. The worst yet arrived this weekend at The Hill from former Republican staffer and freelance pundit Douglas MacKinnon. I won’t go through his litany of examples of occasions when the pundits have been wrong about presidential nominating contests; needless to say he doesn’t bother to mention the many other times the conventional wisdom has been right and the many other times there were mild upsets that were by no means Trump-size. Here’s where he lands, though:

As one who was involved in three winning presidential campaigns, I have watched the ever-evolving Democratic primary campaign for 2020 with growing interest. Over the course of the past year, I’ve discussed with a number of friends and political operatives from both parties that the two Democrats who should strike the most fear in Trump are Buttigieg and Gabbard.

Since precisely zero people have publicly made this argument, you have to wonder if by “discussed” MacKinnon means that these “friends and political operatives” were just listening to him and rolling their eyes.

The headline mentions a “ticket” and the column itself refers to Buttigieg and Gabbard as a “package,” but MacKinnon does not explicitly say which candidate should be the presidential nominee and which the veep. I don’t know if that was intended to boost the odds of this prophecy coming true from .000001 percent to .00001 percent, or was just an oversight in a piece tossed off between drinks or before breakfast. Perhaps more to the point, MacKinnon never really explains why this combination of candidates would be so powerful. We get, on Mayor Pete’s behalf, the unsupported assertion that America is “more than ready” to elect a gay president (I hope that’s true, but I would like to see maybe a speck of evidence), and apparently Gabbard’s big credential is that Hillary Clinton attacked her. Then there’s this clincher:

As a package, those two candidates, with their various skill sets and experiences, do speak to a great many communities and demographics across the country.

Yes, and so would a ticket composed of Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang. That doesn’t mean it makes any sense or would have a snowball’s chance in hell of happening.

MacKinnon was involved in campaigns during the era of Reagan and Poppy Bush, so maybe he’s stuck there and thinks it’s crucial for Democrats to run military veterans. That’s really about the only thing Gabbard and Buttigieg have in common other than being half the age of Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders. Perhaps the weirdest thing about this particular suggestion is that it comes so soon after a Democratic candidate debate in which a nasty quarrel between Buttigieg and Gabbard provided the main drama. Here’s how it was summarized by The Hill, the publication that ran MacKinnon’s column:

Democratic presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard tussled Wednesday night over prior experience and judgment after the Hawaii congresswoman said the South Bend, Ind., mayor wanted to use the U.S. military to fight drug cartels in Mexico, which he denied …

Buttigieg called the accusation “outlandish” and said his comments had been taken out of context. He said he had been talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation and continuing to develop existing law enforcement and military cooperation between the two countries …

﻿Buttigieg on Wednesday countered that he has “enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like” Syrian President Bashar Assad, with whom Gabbard met in 2017.

Gabbard shot back that Buttigieg had made clear that he “would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation.”

These candidates do not appear to like each other. Their ticket is so not happening, and it’s impossible to believe anyone in the White House is losing a moment’s sleep over it. Next, someone will tell us an all-billionaire ticket of Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg (with first and second places TBD) would surely rout the MAGA hordes. It’s about as likely."

As the decade began, there were rea­sons to be optimistic: America had elected its first black president, and despite a global recession just two years earlier, the world hadn’t cascaded into total financial collapse. Obama­care, for all its flaws, was passed, and then came the Iran deal and the Paris climate accords. Sure, there were danger signs: the anger of the tea party, the slow hollowing out of legacy news media, a troubling sense that somehow the bankers got away with it. But then maybe the immediacy of social media gave some hope, at least if you listened to the chatter of the bright young kids in the Bay Area trying to build a new kind of unmediated citizenship. Maybe every­day celebrity, post-­gatekeeper, would change the world for the better. Some of that happened. But we also ended up with the alt­-right and Donald Trump, inequality, impeachment, and debilitating FOMO. How did we get here? Throughout this week, we will be publishing long talks with six people who helped shape the decade — and were shaped by it — to hear what they’ve learned. Read them all here.

If the racial politics of the 2010s has a definitive chronicler, it is Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose magisterial 2014 Atlantic essay “The Case for Reparations” forced Americans to reckon with slavery, Jim Crow, and redlining in ways that many of them never had. Since the essay’s publication — which eventually prompted a congressional hearing on the subject this year, at which Coates testified — the 44-year-old has won a National Book Award for his 2015 book, Between the World and Me, and was awarded a MacArthur “genius” grant. More recently, he’s been writing fiction: He scripted a run of Marvel’s Black Panther comic and published his celebrated first novel, The Water Dancer, which concerns an enslaved man gifted with supernatural powers in antebellum Virginia. Coates’s expansive imagination and incisive, historically grounded writing about Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and cultural figures like Kanye West has cemented his status as a writer through whose eyes many Americans have come to understand the modern era — including me.

Let’s talk about race and politics in the 2010s.

It’s Obama’s decade, unquestionably, which is not to say he was always the prime actor, but I think the force of a black president was such a historic and seismic event that everything, including my conversation with you right now, just was touched by it. It’s really like if I had to pick a singular thing that defined the decade, it would probably be the thing that happened before the 2010s, and that was his election.

The actual start of the decade did mark the beginning of an ill-defined something in politics with the rise of the tea party. If you wanted to mark it there, you would say his losing the House majority, right?

Yeah. We get this electoral manifestation of right-wing backlash for the first time.

How did 2010 affect your understanding of political partisanship? Is partisanship a useful frame through which to understand racism in the past ten years?

I would probably say it the other way and say racism is a useful frame to understand partisanship since the 1960s. The Republican Party is effectively a white party in this country. It’s the party of a white majority that greatly fears becoming a white minority. You have to separate the fact of Obama being a black man from the fact that that black man represented a multiracial party. That’s very, very important. One of the things that I actually even heard Obama himself say was, “Well, I don’t know how much of the opposition is about race because Bill Clinton got it pretty bad before me.” But see, Bill Clinton represented the party that was most associated with black people. He represented, too, a multiracial party. I think Hillary Clinton would have been racialized in the same way. I don’t think you escaped it because you’re white. True, Obama was a much more intense representation of it, but it was really those two things working together. It’s the figure of a black president. At the same time, that figure representing a multiracial party in opposition to a party that is effectively a white party. As much as the tea-party movement in 2010 is just a line of demarcation, you have the current president’s invocation of birtherism, and birtherism is little more than telling the first black president, “Go back to Africa.” It’s not a mistake that throughout Obama’s presidency, you could poll the Republican Party and find anywhere from half to a solid majority of people who actually were birtherists. That’s not accidental. Racism is and was core to what the Republican Party is, which is not to say it has no manifestation and no effect in the Democratic Party.

Birtherism strikes me as one of the few things Trump has done that Republicans haven’t been explicitly willing to defend, even as they do stuff like rationalize his defense of white supremacists in Charlottesville. But there’s also been no broader reckoning with its effect or with how successful it was in getting a number of current Republican representatives into office, either.

Totally. Some of them know better, but that’s always been true. George Wallace — you know his story. Wallace was liked by the NAACP and was liked by black people, and his earliest campaign for governor did not want to make segregation and racism central to his campaign. Then he lost to a guy who went out and did that. He said, “I will never be out-n—–ed again.” He said, “I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about ‘n—–s,’ and they stomped the floor.” It’s a guy that probably knew better. Some of these folks, if they are not racist themselves — and I’m willing to grant that — they don’t find racism so odious and so offensive that they either (a) would not stoop to using it themselves or (b) don’t mind the occupant of the White House using it or being a racist himself.

It does seem odd that with Charlottesville, they’ll bend over backward to be like, “Oh, he didn’t mean that when he was talking about very fine people on both sides,” but with birtherism, Jared Kushner’s like, “I wasn’t around for that. I don’t know about that.” It’s just a very kind of confusing divide to me.

Whenever you have power, you get to delineate history where you want to delineate history. It starts where you want it to matter.

You’ve said that Obama’s presidency made your work possible in that it created this interest and audience for the type of analysis that you were uniquely well positioned to provide. If that’s the case, why do you think people gravitated toward your fairly downbeat analysis of Obama, this figure who inspired a lot of hope and warm feelings?

I really don’t know. I’ve always thought of my job as to try to arrive to some sort of truth, render that truth in a way that is as convincing and as powerful as possible to myself, and then present it to the world. But why people are moved by the things they are moved by, I don’t know. I will say this: I think I am one who has always been attracted to the power of storytelling, whereas if I were, say, a columnist at the New York Times, I don’t know that that effect would’ve held in the same way.

Do you think what Obama made possible in cultural conversation and political conversation extends to this resurgent interest in black cultural products? I’m thinking of stuff like Black Panther, Barry Jenkins’s work.

I really do, because I think there are two ways of analyzing Obama. There’s a politics of him, and there’s Obama as a mythical figure, the symbolic aspect of what he is. People sometimes think the symbols are not very important. I think symbols are really, really important. There’s a reason people fight over the Confederate flag. There’s a reason that Charlottesville starts with wanting a statue of Robert E. Lee to remain. Symbols open people’s minds to what’s possible. It actually was quietly really important that while Barack Obama never disguised the fact that he was biracial, he identified as a black man. He was really clear about that. He managed to assert himself as a black person without any sort of denialism about what his actual ancestry was. I think that was really inspiring to a lot of black people and a lot of white people. I don’t think it was everything. I don’t think it was enough, but I think one should not underestimate the power of Obama as a symbol of the first black president.

Because I’ll tell you one thing, if Obama, let’s say, had been Bill Clinton, right? Like if Obama had been credited to all these rumors of him womanizing or fraternizing with all these white women, and if he had been found to have, God forbid, actual rape allegations on top of that, and if he had been found to, I don’t know, carry on an affair with some 22-year-old white intern, the effect would have been devastating. Negroes would have been hanging their heads like, I cannot believe. And that’s about the symbolism. That’s not about policy.

Is it that Obama was a symbol we could collectively feel good about, who made us feel good about ourselves and our place in America as black people, while also making white people feel good about their ability to tolerate us?

Yeah, it probably did. People forget that Obama is immensely popular with black people, like probably the most popular person maybe after his wife. Why is that? Is that because of policy? No, he is confirming something in them. There’s something in black folks that they feel good about when they see him. And there probably is a critical mass of white people who feel good maybe for other reasons but feel good themselves. Part of that is about the way he conducts himself in public. When Michelle said for the first time in her life, she’s proud to be an American, I bet a lot of black people felt the same way. You got this guy, the embodiment of all of these middle-class values that America preaches and also the black community actually believe in themselves, and here it’s embodied and modeled before the world for eight years. Before Obama, most famous black people were all entertainers. And now you got an actual head of state who conducts himself in a way that you would want your son to conduct himself.

Has that then translated into, okay, so maybe there’s more to us as black people that’s worth investing in, and that’s why we have these cultural products?

Probably not for most, but for some critical mass of white people who probably were already somewhat susceptible to it, yes.

What to you are sort of the most important, impactful, memorable, cultural products of this decade?

Jesmyn Ward, Salvage the Bones, which I just finished a couple of weeks ago and I’m still recovering from. Kendrick Lamar —

Any particular album?

I got to say Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. I felt like he was talking about my childhood, 20 years before. I think about “The Art of Peer Pressure,” and that just sounded like being a kid in the late ’80s, early ’90s. Creed is incredible. Absolutely marvelous film. What it does that it probably doesn’t get enough credit for is it takes a white myth that was, let’s just say, problematic, and it heals. It heals the disturbing things about it, actually. You know what I mean? The Warmth of Other Suns, is that in the period?

That was 2010.

So The Warmth of Other Suns. Absolutely revolutionary. I always felt like it was the spiritual mother of “The Case for Reparations.” What it did was focus on that class of strivers, as opposed to how most books about black people focus on the black poor. It pointed out to me that people think of racism as synonymous to class. What Isabel was showing was even among people who you think of as middle class, they actually have not escaped. You know that you’re not talking about another manifestation of class. You’re talking about an axis that works independent of class along with class. That race is itself a kind of class. And no matter how a much of a striver you are or how middle class you are, it still exerts a penalty on you.

I think of the late ’80s and early ’90s as this kind of explosion of black popular culture with Spike’s heyday and all these black sitcoms that kind of fizzled. Does this current wave feel sustainable in a way that that wasn’t?

I think this time is fundamentally different. The technology has changed.

You talking about the ’80s, you’re talking about no internet, right? The pathways to really get a message out are constricted and the people that control those pathways don’t tend to be black. Also you’re talking about a point that is closer to the civil-rights movement. It is much, much closer to the point where at least nominally America has embraced integration. When I think about somebody like Jesmyn Ward winning the National Book Award twice, right? When I think about Barry winning the Oscar, when I think about Ryan and Creed and how Creed should have won the Oscar. And then when I think about Black Panther and it’s the first comic-book movie in the Best Picture conversations. When I think about how Ava basically got Linda Fairstein shunned by society, I think that’s a different level of power. Obama’s been gone for, what, three years now? Black Panther is after Obama, When They See Us is after Obama. And I know I frighten people even in saying what I’m saying here, but I think probably what you have is more black people in institutional places. You probably have, again, that small but critical mass of white people who’ve been influenced. Black people have shown that you can make money off of black things, as crass as that sounds. We got to talk about Kaepernick, too. We don’t have to talk about him right now, but we got to talk about him before we —

Now’s a good time. I’m embarrassed to say I have not been following the tryout drama as closely as I should have been.

I don’t think you missed much.

Well, talk about it. What’s on your mind about Kaepernick?

I don’t know how things will be looked at 20, 30 years from now, but I think Kaepernick is really, really important.

Is he like Muhammad Ali important in that, like, in 50 years everyone will pretend that this was our hero all along?

I think when he’s no longer dangerous, when he’s no longer trying to get a job, when he’s 40, when he’s 50, a lot of people will be standing up to honor him. This is like how when everybody looks back at the civil-rights movement, they think everybody was like, “Yeah, that’s a great idea.” Clearly, we recognize Bull Connor as the enemy, and this is the good guy. That’s not really how it goes, man. This is exactly like it’s happening with Kaepernick right now. It’s a little messy, you know what I mean? The people pushing for the change ain’t always right. They’re not always pursuing it in the best strategic fashion. The whole country is divided and polarized; the black community itself, polarized and divided. But once the dust settles, I think it will be quite clear what happened.

Even just watching how the public workout went this weekend, I’ve marveled at how well the NFL has normalized the blackballing of Colin Kaepernick. A lot of people basically tried to answer the question, did Kaepernick conduct himself appropriately this weekend? And so the lines of debate begin right now; they don’t begin with a multibillion-dollar business that has an effective monopoly depriving somebody of the right to work because they don’t like what they said, while at the same time granting that right to work to people who have all sorts of problems and issues. Here we are, debating whether Colin Kaepernick should have worn a Kunta Kinte shirt. Meanwhile, Richie Incognito is fine. It’s a real lesson that, despite whatever progress, when you have power, you can do horrible, inhumane, deeply wrong things, and you can normalize those things.

In many ways, this Kaepernick thing is a perfect emblem of white supremacy because they call you the day of the tryout and tell you you got two hours to decide, but it’s either this way or no way. But we never take a second to analyze why are we fighting on this ground? How did we get to the point where the person who’s actually doing the blackballing is considered an equal and legitimate partner? I think that mirrored a larger frame for the politics that happened in this era with Obama and everything around race. People who had done horrible and heinous things nonetheless conferred a kind of legitimacy.

But at the same time, Kaepernick got the 30th-anniversary “Just Do It” Nike campaign. He’s being lionized in this other sphere, which is also a related sphere. NFL and Nike, they do business, right?

They’re unrelated in terms of who they think their base is. Nike, at least part of its legitimacy, it feels, comes from the streets, and who it sells to is young people. But I take your point. It’s very different than Muhammad Ali, right? There was no place for Muhammad Ali to go to in that same sort of way. And I think part of that is the real progress that has happened in terms of how black people are seen in the wider society. Even young people, you probably couldn’t have put Muhammad Ali in an ad in 1968 or done what was done with Colin Kaepernick. He’s eating just fine in a way that Muhammad Ali was not.

Can we talk about Obama’s post-presidency? What do you make of it?

I don’t know. I think in the midst of everything that has happened, I understand the president saying, “Listen, I’m not going to comment on the doings of my successor.” That’s the tradition, right? But I think it puts in stark relief some of the other things Obama is willing to comment on. It’s a little tough to hear, in the midst of the administration pursuing a policy that literally puts children in cages, the president bragging about sexual assault, believes in insulting somebody in real time while they testify before Congress, claiming during his campaign that somebody can’t be his judge because, in his word, he’s a Mexican — it’s tough to see somebody that has the gravitas of Obama, then at the moment they’re speaking out, it’s about some kids on Twitter and cancel culture. That’s a little hard to take. Young people have no power. Obama can’t be canceled, not by them, but the people that are actively at this very moment trying to cancel him, the person who designed his entire presidency around the cancel culture of the Obama administration itself —

By that you mean negating the legacy, negating the gains, negating the policy?

Totally. Trump has been really open about this. His entire identity is a negative identity, by which I mean he defines himself by his ability to take apart the legacy of Barack Obama. It’s just not clear to me what the advantage is in Obama deploying his power in that way. I don’t know who it helps.

If Joe Biden was black, even black people would be like, ’Oh, absolutely not.’

It’s understandable to me that a president would consider it politically expedient to avoid talking about racism in any kind of profound, challenging way, which I think is the core of your criticism of Obama, that he really avoided this subject.

But more than that, the way he addressed people without power. There’s probably a strong political argument for not saying white supremacy is at the core of America. Listen, you’re a president of the United States. I get it. I’m not saying you have to talk like me, but I just think the harshness in the way he talks about people who lack power. I guess what he would say is, “I’m trying to tell them something that would actually help. Da da da da da.” I don’t know that it always comes across that way. I think as a whole, our obsession with young people and what’s happening on college campuses is deeply unhealthy. It bespeaks people who don’t remember being young themselves. So maybe he’s just a part of that, but when the damage is done by Trump and they ask, “What was the first black president talking about?,” and the answer is some kids on college campuses or some people on Twitter. Well, I just, I don’t like how that sounds.

There are now three black candidates running for the Democratic nomination, none of whom seem to be catching on with voters in any meaningful way. What do you think a black candidate has to do to get elected post-Obama?

First of all, you can’t be the first again. That’ll never happen. So the sheer amount of energy that was generated at that particular moment in time following a president who had just basically run the country into the gutter, failed wars. Two failed wars, economy on the brink, all of everything feeling like it’s breaking. Then you get this black dude who comes in, and he’s able to not just capture that feeling from larger Americans, but very specifically become the embodiment of certain things about the black imagination or the black political imagination. You’re just not going to do that again. So that’s the first thing. The second thing is that Barack Obama was not the first black dude to run. There’s this sort of notion that, oh, Barack Obama shows up and then black people just sort of fall over themselves to vote for him. Black people are actually very savvy and very canny. I don’t support Joe Biden for president, but I totally understand why most black people do. I totally understand why the person that’s running second to him in a lot of places is Bernie Sanders. It’s not a mistake. The other thing too is people forget that Obama was just a damn good politician. No disrespect, but what we got? Three candidates? Do any of them have the oratorical skills that Barack had?

Absolutely not.

If he was white, he would have been a remarkable figure as a politician.

The notion that you’re just going to show up and be black and we’re going to follow — it just don’t work like that. The larger populace is sort of amazed that Kamala Harris or Cory Booker hasn’t captured more of the black imagination and black folks in polls, but it’s not that amazing. Barack Obama is just a unique dude, man.

It does seem like the calculus post-Obama among black voters is who we think can win, and part of that calculus is white folks are racist. So what needs have to be fulfilled by a black candidate to win?

I’m not sure. Perhaps what would help is to understand who it could not be. No black person could be who Pete Buttigieg is. You’re not going to be mayor or whatever. You can’t be a black person who’s only been in there and then say, “Hey, I’m going to run the entire country.” That just don’t fly, you know? So it’s probably going to be somebody out of the Senate or the governorship somewhere. I don’t know what would have happened if Deval Patrick had a run from the beginning. I think you got to be a damn fine politician. And you can’t even be Joe Biden, by the way. I don’t even want to pick on Pete Buttigieg. If Joe Biden was black, even black people would be like, “Oh, absolutely not.” He’s going to get killed out there. Bumbling his way through shit. You’re like absolutely no, no, no, no. Absolutely not. But I think a lot of black folks are banking on the white candidate, which may not be wrong.

Trump did this big event in Atlanta recently where he’s promising to fight for every black vote, which was rightly ridiculed. At the same time, he did better with black voters than Mitt Romney or John McCain.

That’s a bad comparison, though. I mean, come on.

Well, let me give you a few other things. House Democrats did worse with black voters in 2018 than they did in 2016. Stacey Abrams in 2018 did worse in Georgia with black voters than Hillary Clinton did in 2016.

I still don’t buy it, Zak. You’re still not going to get me. But go ahead.

They’re obviously very small shifts. Who knows if they mean anything? They do suggest to me that —

They also aren’t apples to apples or oranges to oranges. Hillary Clinton is not running for the same office as Stacey Abrams was.

It’s not crazy to think that Trump showing up in Atlanta and at least trying, like, this dude has nowhere to go but up. The needle could be moved a point or two conceivably.

You know what I would like to see? I would like to see the past 20 years of voting data in terms of black people and Republicans. If you could show me a trend line that was only briefly interrupted by Barack Obama, then I believe you. But I think I’ve seen this comparison out there, and for the most part, you’re talking about different kinds of elections. The question to me is not “Is Trump more successful than Romney or McCain?” The question to me is probably, “Is he more successful than Bush?”

I don’t think he was.

That’s the closest like-to-like I can get. I think black support for Trump is vastly overstated. I guess I kind of resent the basis on which the question is asked. Trump gets — how many more did he get than Romney and McCain?

It was a couple of points.

Meanwhile, white people are voting for a dude who bragged openly about sexual assaults. Why are we not afforded a couple points? Why can’t a couple n—–s be crazy? Excuse my language.

This isn’t to me a question of whether there’s something wrong with us, actually. My question is whether there’s something about Trump that is slightly more appealing, even to kind of fringe black voters.

What I am countering is the very fact that this is significant enough for us to talk about, I think, attests to the kind of, again, normalization that you get when you have power. There are much more significant factors than those two or three points in why Trump is in office. Why does he have power in the first place? I would argue that those two or three points are nowhere near as important as the fact that Trump basically got a majority of every single white demographic you could think of. Majority of every economic cross-section of white people. We’re having this debate about two or three points among black people. But it’s normal for white people to support the dude that thinks foreign policies should be done by tweet. Nobody goes to white people and says, “What in the hell is wrong with y’all?”

I think there has been a thorough critique of the white vote for Trump. Maybe especially in the circles that we are —

Probably so. In our circles, yes. I would agree.

You’ve withdrawn from both social media and nonfiction writing generally for a while to focus on stuff for Marvel and then The Water Dancer. Is there anything at all you’ve seen happen and been like, Oh man, if I wasn’t so busy doing this other stuff, that would be something I would really love to tackle in a big way?

All the time. I wish I was writing about Kaepernick right now. One of the decisions I had to make, though, was am I at my strongest commenting on the day-to-day, or am I at my strongest when I wait, hold my fire, watch, think, let things marinate, and then turn out something that’s more fully formed? This was part of leaving Twitter. I mean, one of the hardest things to do was I had to part with another portion of myself, the blogging portion of myself, the Twitter portion of myself, which I really liked. But the world kind of changed for me, and it became one in which I had to be a lot more careful about what I said and what I did and that’s okay.

Can you talk about your decision to leave Twitter?

You know, what happened was I realized that people were, like, eating off of me. I’ve got a buddy in another field who did something really popular, and he would get criticism sometimes, and he says, “It’s all right man. Everybody eats. I get to eat, the haters get to eat.” That was his thing. I didn’t realize people were eating, man. So every time I would write a piece, I’d get me like 50 fucking responses.

Like written essays, you’re saying?

There’d be like 50 op-eds to what I wrote. I was like, Damn, people are really eating off of this. And then it would be a click economy on Twitter.

During the 2016 campaign, there was a dude and he would like record YouTube videos responding to what I wrote. I realized I have gone to a point where I have more influence and fame then I have thought to dream of. So when I say something, it’s no longer just the writing talking. So that changes, man. You start taking up oxygen in the room. Why don’t I cede some space. Why don’t I be a lot more discerning about when I talk, because what I really care about is the writing. I’m a happier person, by the way, too, having done that.

But I wonder if, do you feel any responsibility to the people? I think it’s fair to say a lot of people turn to you to help them make sense of this cultural moment in a way that was positive, people who made sense of the world through the lens of your analysis. Do you feel any kind of residual responsibility toward those people?

Are you talking about yourself?

I really miss you, man. Come back.

You can text me anytime!

But seriously, just one example: Conversations about racism are easier with a lot of white people I know. I can attribute that largely to your work.

I mean, that’s a good thing. I’m at the end of the book tour right now. I did a big thing in L.A. with Ryan Coogler where we talked to a church full of black folks. I did these small groups in Atlanta, in L.A., in New Orleans, where I got to talk to small groups of black folks. In the middle of this tour, I got to hang out on the Yard at Howard homecoming. I have no problem talking to my people. Something else happens with the larger and white public. That’s cool, too. I think there are very, very few writers who can say they don’t want a larger audience. And if I happen to get a larger audience but I can still stay true to those impulses and instincts that got me here in the first place, then I’m happy. I’m doing all right.

Your article “The Case for Reparations” is credited with reparations being discussed as a very serious policy proposal now. You testified in front of Congress about it. What have your one-on-one conversations about reparations with elected officials been like?

I’ve actually only talked to two people, Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren. It was before she was a presidential candidate. I mean, maybe she was thinking about it. I didn’t get the impression she was. She had just read the piece and, I think, just thought it’d be really cool to talk to the person that wrote it. In terms of other candidates, I like the fact that I don’t really want to be the kind of person that’s consulted by candidates.

So when you were called to testify in front of Congress, nobody sat down with you? They were just like, “Come talk,” basically?

Yeah, that was basically it. I didn’t want to do it. I feel like I speak through the literature. At that point, I felt like I was stepping more into an activist role, and it’s not a space I really want to be in. But at the same time, I felt like so many black folks in the past have sacrificed for me to even have the privilege of saying I didn’t want to be in that role that I kind of had to.

Can you envision a scenario where reparations is (a) formally studied, (b) agreed upon as a thing that should be done, (c) paid out, and (d) ends up actually being enough to remedy the harms that that’s meant to address?

The first thing I would say is the scenario that you just outlined I would argue is not reparations. That’s a bribe. This is why it’s so crucial that it not just be a question of the money but it actually be a question of some sort of attempt to alter how we remember the past. If that goal were accomplished, you would not have a critical mass of Americans and white Americans wanting to wash their hands of it. They would see it as part of who they were and part of their responsibility. The notion, for instance, of reparations being paid out presumes something that happens over a one-year period or something and everybody walks away. I don’t think that’s what you’ll most likely see. First of all, you would most likely see a very decentralized process. I think the responsibility for instance, of elite universities would be very different than responsibility for the deprivations that the GI Bill did or the responsibilities of certain towns where black folks were basically forced to evacuate and leave under threat of being killed. You would see a suite of policies as opposed to a single unitary policy. In fact, this is actually what happened with reparations coming out of the Holocaust. There was no single, solitary act of reparation. There were several, actually, that are ongoing to this day, by the way. I mean, think about that. The end of WWII was 1945. Almost 75 years ago, man. Reparations are still being paid out for the detaining of Japanese-American citizens in this country. Well, the period of redlining is more recent than that. My hope would be there would be a profound reimagining not just of the African-American past and what was done to African-Americans in America and thus the American past in itself, but our responsibilities and how we deal with people in general.

Some of the criticism your work has faced on the left is that you overstate racism’s intrinsic nature in a way that casts it as this elemental force that will be with us forever. It’s baked into the soil we walk on, the air we breathe. Is this a fair assessment of your belief?

No, it’s not a fair assessment, and in defense of leftist critics, I love you, Zak, but I don’t even know if that’s a fair rendition of their criticism.

Do you not? Maybe I’m reading the wrong people.

No, you’ve probably read more than I have. So maybe it is. No, I think it’s totally wrong.

I do think that it’s easily taken away from your work that you believe, at the very least, that the work that needs to be done to end white supremacy in America is an almost, if not totally, insurmountable task because of how committed we are historically and culturally to that idea.

So is white supremacy insurmountable? Can we boil it down to that?

Yeah, let’s put it that way.

No, I would never say that. I think what I said in Between the World and Me is that it’s likely to be with us through the rest of this country’s history. I do believe that’s quite likely.

Can you pick apart what’s different about those two?

I mean, insurmountable implies a kind of certainty. Look, anti-Semitism is what, 2,000 years old, 2,000-plus years old, whatever? Can Europe say it’s free of anti-Semitism? After two millennia of struggle with it?

No, not at all.

So what fucking right does America, or even us who are doing the work here in America, have to presume that we most certainly will be free someday of racism? That’s what I object to. Because I think you deeply understate the challenge that’s faced. This is a country that would not exist without slavery.

It’s in the bones, do you understand what I’m saying? It’s in the economies, it’s in the cultures, it’s in the politics, it’s everywhere. So, just to stick with this example of anti-Semitism, note that the greatest crime of anti-Semitism happened almost 2,000 years into the history of it. So I don’t think that it’s crazy to say that when you’re looking at our country, for some 250 years, a quarter of a millennia, it tolerated the enslavement of people. It tolerated the doctrines that justified that enslavement. It tolerated the culture, it tolerated the politics. Then what followed was an era of pogroms, of Jim Crow, of massacres, of death, of robbery, of raping. And what followed that? An era of mass incarceration where we built the largest prison state ever known to man and we built it on the basis of racism and white supremacy. Dude, this is huge. What good does it do a doctor to act like cancer isn’t a big deal just because he hopes for a cure?

One thing I’ve heard repeatedly from activists I’ve talked to is the need to believe victory is possible.

They’re not wrong. They just have a different job than I have.

Do you think they’re deluded, though?

No, I wouldn’t say that, either. I would never say that.

Is your stance that it’s sort of an unknowable?

When I came to New York City, I wanted to be a writer who could support his family and take care of his family, whose work people respected. I was a college dropout. I had an 11-month-old child. I had no discernible income. The only income in my house was made by my then-partner, now wife, who was making about $29,000 a year. We were living in the basement of a brownstone. If it was somebody’s job to assess, do you think this guy is going to become this celebrated writer? And he said no, I couldn’t really be mad at them for doing that. Now me, myself, who’s out here in the struggle at that time? I had to believe in myself. I had to believe in that beyond whatever empirical evidence might’ve been there in the first place. I know this is a bit of a tortured metaphor. What I’m trying to say is, people who are actually out there doing the work, I understand why they need to believe.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had spent nearly 11 months running for president, almost none of it attacking a rival Democratic candidate by name. She'd reserved her ire for billionaires, shaming Facebook investor Peter Thiel and JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon in her first — so far, only — negative ad. Even when she'd criticized Joe Biden for allegedly “repeating Republican talking points” about heath care, his name slipped out just once, and she dropped that line when Biden pushed back.

Mike Bloomberg is getting some different treatment. On Monday, Warren cheerfully informed an Ankeny, Iowa, audience that it was “day two of Michael Bloomberg’s $37 million ad buy,” saying that was no good for anyone.

“Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020,” Warren continued, at an event focused on her own campaign's volunteers. “His view is that he doesn't need people who knock on doors. He doesn't need to get out and campaign with people. He doesn't need volunteers. And if you get out and knock on 1,000 doors, he'll just spend another $37 million to flood the airways. And that's how he plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party. I think it's fundamentally wrong.”

In his first hours as a candidate for president, Bloomberg has become what the crowded Democratic primary lacked: a pincushion. The latest Democrat to enter the race is offering a campaign of unlimited resources, attempting to hack around the primary system to skip to the expensive general election. It's a direct challenge to the primacy of Iowa and New Hampshire, which some Democrats are fine with. It's also a replacement for the sort of mass organizing and intersectional alliance-building that many Democrats and liberals, led by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), see as the only way to regain power.

“I don't think, at the end of the day, most Democrats are focused on any particular policy other than removing this man from office,” Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, told MSNBC on Monday. “No one's campaigning in the only [states] that matter: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona. Those are the only states that matter in the general election.”

Sheekey was incorrect: Multiple candidates have stumped in those swing states, including Sanders and Warren. That campaigning has taken the form of town halls and rallies with thousands of attendees, as well as small meet-and-greets or labor solidarity events. With less fanfare, the biggest campaigns are also holding daily organizing parties across the country to build post-Iowa operations that could one day be retooled for a general election. Earlier this month, when 1,000 “barnstormers” traveled to Iowa to help Pete Buttigieg, they were advertising the candidate's grass-roots network outside early-voting states.

There is no such grass-roots movement for Bloomberg, despite years of fitful work at creating one. Unity '08 and Americans Elect were launched in 2008 and 2012 to help a potential third-party candidate appear on state ballots, work that collapsed when no candidate of Bloomberg's wealth and stature decided to run. (He officially abandoned the third-party dream after 2016.) Bloomberg's campaign events have flaunted his uniqueness: quick trips to the states, such as Arkansas or Virginia, where he needs to file for the ballot, followed by lunch with local leaders.

Bloomberg's ad buys have touched markets and states that no other candidate was planning to invest in yet. It has the look of a national election, when candidates no longer spend hours talking to voters in diners or VFW halls, and for some in the states, it had upsides.

“Honestly, people appreciated that he came to the state,” said Michael John Gray, the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party. “Unfortunately, when you live in a state run by a Republican majority, sometimes you only see Democrats framed the way Republicans want to frame them. We haven't seen anything like Bloomberg's $250,000 investment here; I mean, that'd be like a $2 million investment elsewhere. That will benefit the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates.”

Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of Texas's Democratic Party, said Bloomberg was simply being smart by investing in states such as his.

“There’s a handful of delegates in New Hampshire and Iowa, and a potful of gold of delegates in Texas and California,” Hinojosa said. “If Mr. Bloomberg is willing to spend that money and make that kind of investment, he’ll be the first Democrat of my lifetime to do it in Texas. Last time around, Hillary Clinton spend $250,000 to buy a little bit of radio here.”

Bloomberg, who has spent personal money to elect both Democrats and Republicans, is uninterested in any argument about campaign financing. Just as Joe Biden did when he ended his opposition to a super PAC, Bloomberg is asking Democrats to think about what a general election really looks like and whether they really want purity when they could have a machine dedicated to ousting Trump.

But Warren and Sanders have turned their small-dollar fundraising into the case for their candidacies; Sanders points out frequently that he has more individual donations than Trump does. Bloomberg has sworn off campaign donations, rejecting the modern Democratic argument — captured by the party's donors-and-polls debate threshold — that small-dollar support is proof that a candidate is competitive.

“This is the arrogance of billionaires,” Sanders told voters in New Hampshire this past weekend. "" ‘Hey, I can run for president because I’m worth $55 billion, and maybe I’ll take $1 billion out of that $55 billion’— not a lot, when you’re worth that much — 'and start running a massive amount of TV ads.'”

The irony in this criticism, from Sanders and Warren, is that neither campaign sees Bloomberg's entry as a problem for them. The former mayor of New York City was urged into the contest, in part, by moderate Democrats worrying about whether former vice president Joe Biden could push past the better-funded Warren or Sanders. At his Virginia stop, Bloomberg both defended his campaign spending (“I've been using my resources for the things that matter to me”) and acknowledged that he was getting high-level interest.

“I was lucky enough to receive some very flattering calls that will just stay between me and whoever made the call,” Bloomberg said. “I didn't grow up in a world where I knew famous people. And when you get a call from one of them, I still pinch myself a little bit.”

For many Democrats, Bloomberg has been on firmer footing when dismissing the role of New Hampshire and Iowa in the primary process by declining to compete for either. Democratic thinking about the first two states, with electorates much whiter than the party as a whole, is conflicted. On Friday, when asked whether Bloomberg was insulting Iowa, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) turned the conversation to campaign finance reform in general.

“The average American is going to make their decision,” she said, “but I know that the average American wants there to be campaign finance reform. We know that whoever you are, we have to get money out of politics. It should not be a function of how much money you have.”

A couple of days later, when a voter put the Bloomberg question directly to Buttigieg, the Indiana mayor was diplomatic. “It's not my place to tell any other campaign what to do,” he said. “As the very first in the nation, you get such a big say on who gets to move on.”

Rejecting donations will keep Bloomberg off December's debate stage, and he has not reached a high enough level in public polls to qualify, anyway. The 17 Democrats running against him are generally viewed more favorably by the party's voters.

“Which version of our democracy is going to win?” Warren asked in Ankeny. “If Michael Bloomberg's version of democracy wins, then democracy changes, and it's going to be about which billionaire you can stomach going forward. Because believe me, I've heard plenty of billionaires who think they should be president, or at the minimum should be picking the president.""

Bloomberg has not done much, yet, to push back against the idea that he's offering Democrats a buyout. Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who endorsed Harris for president in September, did not know that Bloomberg was spending Tuesday in his home state until The Post asked him about the visit.

“The upside is that it brings more attention to our state, [but] I can't say if he will be rewarded,” Gallego said. “I don’t understand why Bloomberg is jumping in. We have winning candidates right now. I endorsed Kamala Harris specifically because I think she can put the coalition together to win. I have doubts Bloomberg can.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Bernie Sanders, “Big Us.” The messaging in this latest Iowa spot is delivered entirely by a farmer who makes a nearly nonideological case for Sanders. Polling has found that he does better on questions of “trust” than he does in a pure horse race. The arguments for Sanders here combine the left's political demons with the right's: “He’s not there for Wall Street. He’s not there for Hollywood. He’s not there for Big Oil, or big pharma or big anybody. Just Big Us.”

Joe Biden, “Commander in Chief."" The Biden pitch in Iowa has distinguished him from Democrats on something immutable: He has been vice president, and nobody else has. The potential comfort of replacing Trump with Barack Obama's running mate is the entire focus of this spot, more than a particular foreign policy issue: Biden would, in his words, “stand with our allies” and “know them by their first names.”

Elizabeth Warren, “Climate.” The senator's first spot in Iowa was a detailed look at her Social Security expansion plan; her second spot is a broader pitch for her climate change plans, which include a Green New Deal and are centered on domestic job creation. It's a lot like a spot Sanders previously ran in the state, though Warren seems to have hit on the concise plan ad as her strategy, now that she's on the air.

Club for Growth, “Foreign."" The conservative PAC is trying to shape Alabama's wide-open Senate primary, which was reshaped this month when Jeff Sessions returned to run again. This spot targets Rep. Bradley Byrne, one of the first Chamber of Commerce-friendly candidates who defeated a more conservative challenger in the 2014 cycle. Byrne has since rebranded himself as a Trump ally, and the Club is trying to cut into that armor by attacking Byrne's reliable vote for Republican leadership in the House, specifically to keep the Export-Import Bank active.

The Sanders campaign, which had put up with a few weeks of speculation on whether he was falling out of contention, has celebrated this poll for good reason. It's the second in one month to show him in a lead, albeit bunched up with a few other candidates. Where it differs from those polls: Sanders's own support has remained steady, with no obvious movement since the summer. Just a few trajectories have changed dramatically: Biden and Harris have lost support, Buttigieg has gained it, and both Yang and Gabbard have ticked up as fewer voters became undecided. That could affect the Sanders campaign in ways not worth predicting until after Iowa: His supporters from 2016 have been the most interested in Yang's and Gabbard's sort of anti-establishment candidacies.

At the start of this month, Warren released her Medicare-for-all payment plan; two weeks later, she released a two-part transition plan. In the details, both get closer to what Democratic voters say they prefer, with a single-payer health plan on the horizon after more people are enrolled in Medicare. But every poll has found the same voters getting skittish about Warren herself; here, her steady progress on the question of which candidate could beat the president has retreated to what it was this summer.

There's been little movement in any impeachment polling since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) first announced her support for an inquiry. Small moves in the basic question — should the president be removed from office — have been over-read as the surge of new impeachment support, or as the complete collapse of the Democrats' strategy. This is as much movement as we've seen, with voters ready to believe that the president committed a crime but unsure of what to do about it.

IN THE STATES

Arkansas. Democrats, who held both of the state's Senate seats at the start of this decade, will not field a challenger to Republican Sen. Tom Cotton. Democrat Josh Mahony, who had been running alone for the party's nomination, quit the race right after the filing deadline, citing unspecified personal reasons.

Michigan. Republicans hit a setback in their legal battle to stop a voter-created redistricting commission from drawing the state's next electoral maps, after the Western District of Michigan ruled against them. Republican plaintiffs argued that, by preventing Michiganders with political ties from serving on the commission, the First Amendment rights of potential mapmakers were being infringed. The court didn't bite, writing that “while the First Amendment is a check on the State’s authority, the State’s interests in designating eligibility criteria for an effective redistricting commission are, on balance, more than sufficient to justify the challenged provisions.”

2020

Joe Biden. He picked up the endorsement of Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada, the first member of the state's lopsidedly Democratic congressional delegation to support a candidate. He was also involved in a back-and-forth with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, after Biden said he was disappointed in his former colleague for calling for an investigation into his son, Hunter. “It's not going to work,” Graham told NBC News. “I like Joe Biden, you know, all I can say is that Joe didn't pull any punches when he ran against [John] McCain; that's the way the system works.”

Pete Buttigieg. He was endorsed by Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York and Rep. Pete Visclosky of Indiana, the second and third members of Congress to support him. He had just one congressional endorsement until this week, far behind the other high-polling candidates.

Deval Patrick. He spoke at New Hampshire's “Politics and Eggs” breakfast, playing down the difficulties of entering the race so late: “The path we knew was there is wider than I fully appreciated.” He's spending Tuesday in South Carolina, his second trip to the state in an 11-day campaign.

Tulsi Gabbard. She's holding town halls in New Hampshire, where she has been polling best, over most of Thanksgiving week: Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

Mike Bloomberg. He filed in person Tuesday for Arizona’s primary, accompanying it with another news conference in which he spelled out a health-care plan similar to Joe Biden’s (building slowly from the Affordable Care Act) and explained a bit more of his migration to the Democratic Party. “I certainly could never run as a Republican,” he said. “The old-line Republican Party was very different than the one today. I don't agree with virtually anything they stand for.”

Bernie Sanders. He’ll make a post-Thanksgiving return trip to South Carolina.

Elizabeth Warren. She sat down with the Des Moines Register’s editorial board, spelling out in more detail how she could implement a wealth tax. Europeans, she said, botched the wealth tax when they “went way too deep into the wealth range,” and Americans could grow the staff of the Internal Revenue Service to assess the property of the wealthy that would be subject to tax. “Billionaires are slippery.”

Michael Bennet. He picked up an endorsement in New Hampshire from state Rep. Joyce Fulweiler.

Cory Booker. In a new campaign memo, his team said that its focus for the next few weeks will be qualifying for the December debate. “We know the most important thing we can do for Cory Booker right now is to ensure that every dollar spent, every volunteer shift booked, every waking moment our campaign staff spends in the next two weeks is geared toward persuading voters that Cory should be their first choice in this contest.”

WAIT, WHAT?

If someone created a pool, letting people bet on which Democrat would be first to speculate about ending the impeachment inquiry, the most money may have been put on freshman members from swing districts, or one of the two Democrats (New Jersey's Jeff Van Drew and Minnesota's Collin Peterson) who rejected the inquiry in the first place.

Good news: No one lost their money. It was Rep. Brenda Lawrence of Michigan, whose district Hillary Clinton carried by 61 points, who seemed to panic about the politics of impeachment.

“We are so close to an election,” Lawrence said on this week's edition of Detroit reporter Charlie LeDuff's podcast. “I will tell you, sitting here knowing how divided this country is, I don't see the value of taking him out of office. I do see the value of putting down a marker saying his behavior is not acceptable.”

Republicans were overjoyed. Up to now, speculation about Democrats getting skittish on impeachment was just that — speculative — with anecdotes of freshmen nervous about the ads Republicans were buying in their districts. Lawrence had broken the seal, repeating a core Republican argument against impeachment while suggesting that Democrats might want to officially censure the president and move on.

As soon as the story caught fire, Lawrence flipped. “The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks,” she said in a statement. “The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.”

We're back to where we were on Monday morning: lots of scattered Democratic worries about impeachment, but no House Democrat actually calling for the party to drop it.

It's official: Mike Bloomberg is running for president. And he is about to spend millions of dollars to tout the millions of dollars he has already spent combating President Trump and the coal industry.

The former New York mayor, who is one of the richest people in the world, entered the crowded 2020 Democratic primary on Sunday after weeks of teasing a self-financed campaign. He unrolled a multipronged pitch to voters that included trumpeting his extensive environmental philanthropy since stepping down as mayor in 2013.

In a campaign video released Sunday previewing the issues he will focus on in the race, a narrator notes how Bloomberg both “stood up to the coal lobby” and to “the outright denial of this administration” on climate change.

Those lines appear to refer to at least two past spending endeavors by Bloomberg: The more than $100 million he put into the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign to press for the closure of coal plants, and a grant of nearly $6 million in 2017 into a New York University School of Law center helping state attorneys general challenge the Trump administration's rollback of environmental rules.

When it comes to campaigning for the Democratic nomination, that spending is both a blessing and a curse. Bloomberg has real bona fides in the environmental movement for his philanthropy, but his candidacy comes at a moment when many Democratic voters are deeply skeptical of the power billionaires wield in politics.

To that point: Bloomberg's campaign team is dropping more than $30 million to reserve television advertising to launch his last-minute bid. That sum is on top of his jaw-dropping $100 million ad campaign in key battleground states targeting Trump exclusively.

One of Bloomberg's rivals, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said in a statement he was ""disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections.""

Bloomberg has butted heads with the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party before. When Barack Obama was in office, he irked some environmentalists by praising natural gas as a “bridge fuel” between coal and renewable sources. And more recently, he criticized Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-N.Y.) Green New Deal as politically unrealistic.

So far, the Bloomberg campaign has focused on what the former mayor has already done on climate change — not what he would do if president. Bloomberg's newly refurbished campaign website claims his data-driven mayoral administration reduced New York's carbon footprint by 14 percent, planted 800,000 trees and added 850 acres to parks.

— Trump vs. California: Environmental groups have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the move to rescind California’s waiver to set its own vehicle emissions standards.

Their argument: “EPA doesn’t have the authority to withdraw a waiver, and, even if it did, none of the justifications put forth stand up to scrutiny,” Mike Landis, an attorney for Environment America, said in a statement. Environment America was one of 11 groups to file the lawsuit alongside the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and others. The lawsuit follows a similar legal action from California and other states.

— EPA bans consumer use of chemical found in paint stripper: The Environmental Protection Agency’s ban on consumer sales of methylene chloride, a toxic chemical used in paint and coating strippers, went into effect on Saturday. Numerous major retailers, including Walmart, Home Depot and Lowes, have already banned products containing the chemical. “EPA’s action keeps paint and coating removers that contain the chemical methylene chloride out of consumers’ hands,” EPA chief Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. “It is against the law to sell or distribute methylene chloride for paint and coating removal in the retail marketplace — a step that will provide important public health protections for consumers.”

— Rick Perry avoiding the heat: The energy secretary is preparing to step down from his post on Dec. 1, but amid the House impeachment inquiry, he has declined to cooperate with a congressional subpoena and has so far avoided tough questions, CNN reports.

“Key questions about what he knew and when have gone unanswered, and Perry's aides appear to have shielded him on multiple occasions from questions about revelations in this week's testimony,” per the report. "" … Perry avoided reporters' questions at two speeches he delivered earlier in the week. When he spoke to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, Energy Department officials shielded him from reporters by sending what appeared to be an empty decoy SUV driven by his security officers to the building's front door while Perry slipped through a different door.”

I don’t hate him. I feel sad for him. And what’s he’s doing to the world is just criminal, it’s just criminal, it’s terrible. But there are more of us, and we can make a difference.”

— Experts warn about the threat of 5G technology: Negotiators announced a long-awaited global deal to determine how companies should deploy 5G technology, but data from federal agencies and the World Meteorological Organization shows that it could pose a risk to weather forecasting accuracy. “Studies completed before the negotiations by U.S. government agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA and the Navy had warned that 5G equipment operating in the 24-gigahertz frequency band could interfere with transmissions from polar-orbiting satellites used to gather weather data,” The Post’s Andrew Freedman reports. “This could make forecasts much less reliable, the reports found.”

THE BIG IDEA: What makes America exceptional isn’t any arsenal. It’s moral authority.

That’s the upshot of Richard V. Spencer’s Sunday letter to President Trump, acknowledging his “termination” as secretary of the navy. The messy circumstances surrounding Spencer’s exit should not overshadow another damning resignation letter from another Trump appointee.

Spencer explained that he has strived over two-plus years on the job to ensure judicial proceedings are “fair, transparent and consistent,” from ensigns to admirals. “Unfortunately, it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline,” he wrote. “I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

His language goes further than Jim Mattis’s letter last December when he resigned as secretary of defense to protest Trump ordering U.S. troops to withdraw from Syria, but there are echoes. Both Spencer and Mattis said Trump deserves someone whose views are better aligned with his own.

Spencer was ousted over his efforts to resolve a dispute between the White House and Navy commanders who wanted to strip Edward Gallagher of the Trident pin that makes him a Navy SEAL. Gallagher’s was one of three cases in the military justice system that Trump intervened in 10 days ago. The chief petty officer was accused of committing war crimes during a 2017 deployment in Iraq. He was acquitted of murder but convicted in July of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State prisoner. Trump reinstated Gallagher’s rank after he was demoted as part of his punishment. The president tweeted on Thursday that he doesn’t want Gallagher, who has become a cause celebre on Fox News, kicked out of the SEALs.

“The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries,” Spencer told Trump, offering a brief history lesson. “Good order and discipline is what has enabled our victory against foreign tyranny time and again, from Captain Lawrence's famous order ‘Don't Give up the Ship,' to the discipline and determination that propelled our flag to the highest point on Iwo Jima. The Constitution, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, are the shields that set us apart, and the beacons that protect us all.”

-- Disdain for the rule of law has been a recurring feature of Trumpism.

-- Spencer, 65, served in the Marines as an aviator from 1976 to 1981, separating as a captain, before making a fortune on Wall Street. He has been secretary of the Navy since the Senate confirmed him in August 2017. In his letter, he praised the troops who will soon miss their Thanksgiving dinners at home so that they can continue the watch beyond the curve of the horizon.

“As Secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks,” Spencer wrote. “I regard this as deadly serious business. The lives of our Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates quite literally depend on the professional execution of our many missions, and they also depend on the ongoing faith and support of the people we serve and the allies we serve alongside.”

-- Pentagon spokespeople said Defense Secretary Mark Esper asked for Spencer’s resignation after losing confidence in him. Their explanation is that Esper became “deeply troubled” when he discovered Spencer was backchanneling with the White House to offer a secret deal in which a review board would decide to let Gallagher keep his Trident pin – and affiliation with the SEALs – if Trump didn’t directly meddle in the official peer-review process, thereby maintaining the appearance of independence.

-- “Spencer had tried to find a compromise,” David Ignatius reports in his column, “after Trump tweeted Thursday, ‘The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin.’ Spencer feared that a direct order from Trump to protect Gallagher, who is represented by two former partners of Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, would be seen as subverting military justice. After that Trump tweet, Spencer cautioned acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney that he would not overturn the planned SEAL peer review of Gallagher without a direct presidential order; he privately told associates that if such an order came, he might resign rather than carry it out. …

“‘It was a hold-your-nose solution,’ said a source close to Spencer about his effort to broker an arrangement that would allow Gallagher to retire at the end of November with his former rank, an honorable discharge and his Trident pin, as Trump wanted, but without direct presidential interference in the SEAL review process. As so often happens with attempts to work with Trump’s erratic demands, this one ended in disaster. ‘The president wants you to go,’ Esper told Spencer on Sunday … Esper then toed the White House line and announced Spencer’s dismissal. …

“Trump began lobbying Spencer to exempt Gallagher from Navy discipline back in March, when he ordered the Navy secretary in an early-morning phone call to release Gallagher from the brig and give him more comfortable quarters. Presidential pressure has been relentless, ever since. … While Gallagher is celebrated on Fox, current and former senior officers of the SEALs and other elite units told me this weekend that his case has little support within the community of Special Operations forces. One former SEAL commander noted that maintaining discipline among these elite units is so important that the SEAL peer-review panels have removed more than 150 Trident pins since 2011, or more than one a month.”

-- Trump now gets the outcome he wanted: Esper’s aides said he will let Gallagher keep his Trident pin without even the pretense of a review board. And Trump has rid himself of someone he came to disregard as disloyal, based on his threat to resign.

-- Spencer joins a growing list of former Trump appointees who have spoken critically, to varying degrees, about the president after leaving his employ. This includes, among others, John Bolton, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Tom Bossert, Fiona Hill and Gary Cohn.

-- Spencer took the sting out of this punch by vigorously denying well-sourced press reports on Saturday that he had threatened to resign. In the version of his letter distributed to media outlets last night, the date “24 Nov 19” has been scrawled by hand on the top right of a letter that was reportedly drafted last week. The denial of accurate media accounts muddies the narrative around the secretary’s departure.

-- This appears to be the coda of a contentious chapter in a civilian-military relationship that has grown increasingly fraught. Trump avoided military service by claiming bone spurs. He has stated that avoiding sexually transmitted infections while bedding models in New York during the 1970s was “my personal Vietnam.” Trump has insulted several war heroes, as well as their families, and never apologized.

-- The top U.S. military officer voiced public support today for Esper’s decision to allow Gallagher to remain a Navy SEAL and to fire Spencer. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s case closed now,” Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters traveling with him in the Middle East, including Missy Ryan. “It’s time to move on and address the national security of the United States. … Esper made decisions for good reasons that are within his power. I’ll support the secretary of defense in those decisions.”

-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he spoke by phone with Spencer on Sunday night: “I told him he’s a patriot, that he served the Navy and the nation well and he will be missed,” Schumer said in a statement. “Secretary Spencer did the right thing and he should be proud of standing up to President Trump when he was wrong, something too many in this administration and the Republican Party are scared to do. Good order, discipline, and morale among the Armed Services must transcend politics, and Secretary Spencer’s commitment to these principles will not be forgotten.”

-- Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Trump notified him personally that Spencer was being fired. “Both Secretary Esper and President Trump deserve to have a leadership team who has their trust and confidence,” Inhofe said in a statement, adding: “It is no secret that I had my own disagreements with Secretary Spencer over the management of specific Navy programs.”

-- Other lawmakers offered praise for Spencer:

I worked very closely with him on expanding our Naval fleet, strengthening both our public and private shipyards, and supporting our troops. His departure is a great loss to the Department of Defense and our country. (2/2) — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) November 25, 2019

As we often find from this White House, there are multiple “official” versions of the secretary of the Navy’s departure. In every telling, though, President Trump undermines military discipline and the Rule of Law with his words and actions. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) November 25, 2019

-- Trump tweeted that he will nominate Kenneth Braithwaite, a retired Navy rear admiral who is currently the ambassador to Norway, to be Spencer’s replacement. Esper recommended him.

-- In an interview Sunday morning on “Fox & Friends,” Gallagher said the Navy was only trying to take his Trident pin away as “retaliation” for Trump intervening on his behalf. “They could have taken my Trident at any time they wanted,” he said on a show the president often watches. “Now they're trying to take it after the president restored my rank.” Speaking of Rear Adm. Collin Green, who is in charge of the SEAL program as commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command, Gallagher said: “What the admiral is doing is showing complete insubordination.”

-- Ray Mabus, who served as Navy secretary under Barack Obama, said on MSNBC that he’s been stunned that a sailor on active duty is going on cable television to criticize his commanding officers. “It's so dangerous for good order and discipline … to get this politicized,” Mabus said Sunday on MSNBC. “You simply cannot have good order and discipline. You simply cannot hold people accountable. You simply cannot have the elite fighting force if you allow things like this to happen. If you set this sort of precedent, then how do you tell the next SEAL that is up on charges not to go public, not to try to undermine their superiors, not to try to change a military judgment and make it a political one?”

-- The Post’s Editorial Board says Trump’s intervention in the Gallagher case, including Spencer’s ouster, dishonors the troops who uphold American values: “Restoring to service someone who was turned in by members of his unit who wouldn’t tolerate his behavior sends precisely the wrong message. … Most offensive is what Mr. Trump’s actions say about his view of the military. ‘We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!,’ he tweeted in October when he announced he would review these cases. Perhaps Mr. Trump has watched too many bad war movies, but if he were to consult with his military leaders or talk to the many fine men and women in uniform, they would tell him they are trained to engage in combat while following the laws of war and upholding the country’s ideals.”

QUOTE OF THE DAY: A lawyer for Gallagher, Tim Parlatore, welcomed last night’s news and expressed amazement at the turn of events that led to Spencer’s ouster. “This case is bananas,” he said. ""Yes, you can quote that.” (Ashley Parker and Dan Lamothe)

THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:

-- A confidential White House review of Trump’s decision to place a hold on military aid to Ukraine has turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, according to three people familiar with the records. Josh Dawsey, Carol D. Leonnig and Tom Hamburger scoop: “The research by the White House Counsel’s Office … includes early August email exchanges between acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House budget officials seeking to provide an explanation for withholding the funds after the president had already ordered a hold in mid-July on the nearly $400 million in security assistance … White House lawyers are expressing concern that the review has turned up some unflattering exchanges and facts that could at a minimum embarrass the president. …

“In the early August email exchanges, Mulvaney asked acting OMB director Russell Vought for an update on the legal rationale for withholding the aid and how much longer it could be delayed. Trump had made the decision the prior month without an assessment of the reasoning or legal justification … Emails show Vought and OMB staffers arguing that withholding aid was legal, while officials at the National Security Council and State Department protested. OMB lawyers said that it was legal to withhold the aid, as long as they deemed it a ‘temporary’ hold …

“Mulvaney’s request for information came days after the White House Counsel’s Office was put on notice that an anonymous CIA official had made a complaint to the agency’s general counsel about Trump’s July 25 call to [Volodymyr] Zelensky … This official would later file a whistleblower complaint with the intelligence community’s inspector general …

“The document research has only exacerbated growing tension between [White House Counsel Pat] Cipollone and Mulvaney and their offices, with Cipollone tightly controlling access to his findings, and Mulvaney’s aides complaining Cipollone isn’t briefing other White House officials or sharing important material they need to respond to public inquiries … The emails revealed by White House lawyers include some in which Mulvaney urges Vought to immediately focus on Ukraine’s aid package, making clear it was a top priority for the administration. [Mulvaney’s lawyer, Robert Driscoll, declined to comment.]

“The legal office launched this fact-finding review of internal records in a protective mode, both to determine what the records might reveal about internal administration conversations and also to help the White House produce a timeline for defending Trump’s decision and his public comments. Along with examining documents, the review has also involved interviewing some key White House officials involved in handling Ukraine aid and dealing with complaints and concerns in the aftermath of the call between Trump and Zelensky. Cipollone’s office has focused closely on correspondence that could be subject to public records requests, those which involve discussions between staff at the White House and at other agencies. Internal White House records are not subject to federal public records law, but messages that include officials at federal agencies are.”

-- Follow the money: Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the Rudy Giuliani associates who have been indicted, tried to recruit a Ukrainian energy executive to join them in a proposed takeover of the state oil-and-gas company. From the Wall Street Journal: The two men described the “company’s chief executive and [Marie Yovanovitch] as part of ‘this Soros cartel’ working against [Trump.] ‘You’re a Republican, right?’ Andrew Favorov, the head of natural gas for state-run Naftogaz, recalled the men … asking him, after their reference to investor and Democratic donor George Soros. ‘We want you to be our guy.’ … Mr. Favorov described the efforts of Messrs. Fruman and Parnas to enlist his help in an effort to oust Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev. Naftogaz is the most important company in Ukraine, representing nearly 10% of the country’s gross domestic product and supplying virtually all of the country’s natural gas. Mr. Favorov said he was bewildered by Messrs. Parnas and Fruman’s pitch to stage a takeover of Naftogaz and put Mr. Favorov in place as CEO. On one hand, the pair appeared to know little about the natural gas business; on the other it was clear to him they had significant political connections. ‘They don’t teach you how to deal with this in business school,’ Mr. Favorov said.”

-- So many potential conflicts: Giuliani also discussed representing a state-owned Ukrainian bank in a legal dispute over the summer, even as he publicly pressed Ukraine on behalf of Trump. From Bloomberg News: “Though he ultimately did not take on the client, the talks expose his enthusiasm for foreign business and his willingness to insert himself in matters rife with potential conflicts. In fact, the Ukrainian bank is entangled in a legal dispute with its former owner who has ties to Ukraine’s president and is the subject of a federal investigation in the U.S. … [Giuliani] said he was approached by lawyers for Privatbank seeking to recover assets linked to the previous owner. They wanted to know if Giuliani -- who had written tweets critical of the man -- could assist their civil suit, Giuliani confirmed by phone on Thursday.”

-- “What we still don’t know about the Ukraine affair,” by deputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl: “Let’s start with the distinct possibility that Trump’s demand that [Zelensky] launch politicized investigations in exchange for military aid and a White House meeting was only the last of a series of quid pro quos he forced on Ukrainians.” Giuliani met with Zelensky’s predecessor at least twice in 2017 as Ukraine’s former chief prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko transferred an investigation into secret payments to Paul Manafort, effectively stalling it, and the U.S. released the sale of Jaevelin missiles to Ukraine. “Let’s see: a White House meeting and weapons ... for favorable actions on an investigation? There’s no proof. But no wonder Trump complained to Zelensky in their July 25 phone call that ‘I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair.’ One of Zelensky’s first acts had been to fire Lutsenko.

“The prosecutor has also been blamed for Trump’s recall of [Yovanovitch]. But the full story behind her dismissal is still not known. … Trump began demanding Yovanovitch’s removal a year earlier, after meeting with [Parnas and ­Fruman]. Why did Parnas and Fruman want the ambassador out? It’s still not clear. … One person who probably could shed light on this is Rick Perry. … According to testimony by U.S. Embassy staffer David Holmes, Perry used a meeting with Zelensky to give him a list of ‘people he trusts’ on energy matters. The Times reported that these included a couple of Texas businessmen whom Perry wanted appointed to the supervisory board of the Ukrainian state gas company. That’s the same company Parnas and Fruman were trying to deal with. … We may eventually learn more about Ukraine from federal prosecutors in New York, who have already indicted Parnas and Fruman and are said to be looking at Giuliani. But you have to wonder if Democrats are making a mistake by not pursuing these matters themselves.”

-- Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said reports that he met with ex-Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in Vienna to obtain information about the Bidens were false. Elise Viebeck and Felicia Sonmez report: “The allegation … was made by the attorney for [Parnas]. … On Fox News, Nunes declined to answer further questions about the accusation ... A person close to Shokin also has denied the claim. … Nunes has also threatened to sue two of the news outlets that reported Parnas’s accusation. On Fox News, Nunes claimed that CNN and the Daily Beast were ‘likely conspiring to obstruct justice’ by basing their reporting on interviews with a lawyer for Parnas. ... House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said Saturday that it was ‘quite likely, without question’ that Nunes would face an ethics investigation following media reports of a meeting with Shokin. … Several other Democratic lawmakers have said that Parnas’s testimony could be helpful to impeachment investigators or that Nunes should face an ethics probe.”

-- Lordy, there are tapes? Parnas has provided the House Intelligence Committee with audio, photos and video recordings, but what these records show is unclear. From ABC News: “[The] tapes were provided as part of that congressional subpoena issued to Parnas, and the former Giuliani ally also provided a number of documents both in English and Ukrainian to the committee in two separate productions … However, some of the material sought by congressional investigators is already in possession of federal investigators within the Southern District of New York and thus held up from being turned over, according to sources familiar with the matter.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said his panel will press ahead with preparing its impeachment report, even though several key witnesses have refused to testify. Felicia Sonmez and Elise VIebeck report: “In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’ … Several key figures, including [Mulvaney], Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former national security adviser John Bolton and [Giuliani], have declined to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. A federal judge is expected to rule [today] on whether [former White House counsel Don McGahn] must testify under subpoena. …

""Schiff said Sunday that time is of the essence and that Democrats will continue to investigate even after they have submitted their report to the House Judiciary Committee. ... 'The investigation isn’t going to end,’ he said, adding that ‘we may have other depositions and hearings to do.’ He took particular aim at Bolton, arguing that the former national security adviser will have to explain why he chose to give his account of events ‘in a book’ rather than show the ‘courage’ that Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council Russia adviser, did in testifying before lawmakers last week. Schiff declined to say how long it might take impeachment investigators to finish their report, saying only that ‘we’ll take the time that’s necessary.’”

-- Amid tensions between the Trump administration and Democrats, Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin must work out a spending deal. Luckily, they appear to maintain a good rapport. From the Journal: “While the Office of Management and Budget leads the administration’s efforts on spending, Mr. Mnuchin has emerged as the public face of the administration on Capitol Hill in the spending talks, which took a positive turn this weekend even as impeachment strains the broader relationship between the two branches. Mr. Mnuchin’s role speaks to the rapport and goodwill he has built up with lawmakers and, in particular, Mrs. Pelosi ... Mrs. Pelosi has clashed with two of the administration’s other top negotiators, [Mulvaney] and [Vought], with whom she refused to negotiate last summer’s budget deal. … House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D., Ky.) said … that Mr. Mulvaney would normally play a more visible role in the negotiations, ‘but I think Mick, he has other distractions.’”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Hong Kong’s pro-democracy parties swept aside the pro-Beijing establishment during local council elections in a significant endorsement of the protest movement that’s shaken the territory. Shibani Mahtani, Simon Denyer, Tiffany Liang and Anna Kam report: “Voters took to the polls in record numbers to cast ballots in the only fully democratic election in the Chinese territory, an early sign that they wanted to send a strong message to their government and to the Communist Party in Beijing. Early results compiled by the South China Morning Post showed pro-democracy parties winning 278 of the first 344 seats to be declared, pro-Beijing parties taking 42, and independents 24. Many prominent figures in the protest movement won, and many leading pro-establishment figures were unseated. Pro-democrats look to be able to secure 12 of 18 district councils available in Hong Kong — before this vote, they did not have a majority in any. … The turnout — 2.94 million, or more than 71 percent of the 4.13 million eligible voters — was more than double the 1.4 million who voted in local elections in 2015. Voter registration was also a record high, driven in part by 390,000 first-time voters.”

-- The election’s results will pressure Beijing to rethink its approach. Shibani, Simon and Tiffany report: “With this rebuke of its affiliates in the city, Beijing faces a choice among opening up politics as promised in Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, extending a crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters by the city’s police force and government, or trying to navigate a delicate middle path. Beijing can continue to dig in, but it would risk escalating and prolonging the conflict now that the electorate has spoken, said Ho-Fung Hung, an expert on the Chinese political economy and Hong Kong politics at the Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. …. Reacting to the outcome on Monday, Chinese state media accused foreign forces, particularly the United States, of interfering. … [Carrie] Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled leader, said in a statement Monday that her government respects the election results and acknowledged ‘various analyses and interpretations.’ … Susan Shirk, a China expert and former official in the Clinton administration who is now at the University of California at San Diego, said it was possible that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had not been receiving accurate information from lower-level officials on the public dissatisfaction in Hong Kong, despite months of protests.”

-- A growing body of evidence from former detainees, human rights groups and reporters details the Chinese government’s efforts to detain more than 1 million ethnic minorities in camps. Hannah Knowles, Kim Bellware and Lateshia Beachum report: “Papers released Sunday pierce a culture of intense secrecy to add a new piece of corroboration: the government’s own classified directives. Provided to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by an anonymous source, the documents lay bare a crackdown in Xinjiang that has sought to stamp out minority culture, language and religion — with a particular focus on the Muslim Uighurs, whom the government blames for regional unrest. A manual, the first of its kind to be made public, details the inner workings of the three-year-old detention camps, while four intelligence briefings illuminate the mass surveillance that identifies people for internment on merely the suspicion that they may cause trouble. …

“Camps are heavily secured and full of surveillance, according to the manual signed by Zhu Hailun, who used to be in charge of security in Xinjiang. … Some communication with outsiders is allowed to put family ‘at ease.’ Detainees are supposed to have phone conversations with relatives at least once a week and video chats every month.”

-- A “phase two” trade deal between the U.S. and China is looking less likely. From Reuters: “Officials in Beijing say they don’t anticipate sitting down to discuss a phase two deal before the U.S. election, in part because they want to wait to see if Trump wins a second term. ‘It’s Trump who wants to sign these deals, not us. We can wait,’ one Chinese official told Reuters…. Trump’s main priority at the moment is to secure a big phase one announcement, locking in big-ticket Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods that he can tout as an important win during his re-election campaign, according to a Trump administration official.”

-- Pope Francis called for the abolition of nuclear weapons while visiting Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Akiko Kashiwagi and Chico Harlan report: “Pope Francis called Sunday for a ‘world without nuclear weapons,’ which he said are ‘immoral’ for war or deterrence. ‘We will be judged on this,’ Francis said. In Hiroshima, the pope met with bomb survivors and spoke vividly of the ‘black hole of death and destruction’ atomic weapons could cause. Earlier, in a somber address in Nagasaki delivered in the driving rain, he spoke about the weapons in policy terms and expressed concern that a ‘climate of distrust’ was endangering international arms control efforts. … Francis used the first papal trip to Japan since 1981 to emphasize one of his signature issues in cities that remain lasting symbols of atomic destruction (though both have been fully rebuilt in the decades since the 1945 attacks). … After laying a wreath to the Nagasaki bombing’s victims, the pope said the arms race creates a false sense of security, poisoning international relationships. He described nuclear weapons as wasteful and environmentally damaging. ... By saying that weapons shouldn’t be held for deterrence — a stance he first outlined in 2017 — Francis has gone further than his predecessors. The only other pope to visit Japan, John Paul II, said during the Cold War that deterrence could be 'morally acceptable,' so long as it was a step toward disarmament.""

-- A couple kidnapped by Islamists was rescued in the Philippines during a military operation. Regine Cabato reports: “Allan Hyrons, 71, and Wilma Hyrons, 59, were abducted last month by Abu Sayyaf fighters at a beach resort the couple owned in the southern Philippines. They were rescued around 8 a.m. Monday in the island province of Sulu after a 20-minute firefight, said regional military commander Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, who attributed the operation’s success to support from the public. … The rescue of the Hyrons came at the end of a three-day operation, which the military said left six militant fighters dead.”

-- The White House asked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to block the resolution that would have formally recognized Turkey’s genocide of the Armenian people. From Axios: Graham was leaving the Oval Office after he joined a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan when a senior White House staff asked him to object on the floor to the resolution that had passed the House to avoid upsetting Erdogan. ""Graham confirmed this in a phone interview on Saturday. ... A White House legislative affairs official told Graham that Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) was going to bring up his Armenian genocide resolution and asked if Graham could ‘please object.’ ‘I said sure,’ Graham said. ‘The only reason I did it is because he [Erdoğan] was still in town. ... That would've been poor timing. I'm trying to salvage the relationship if possible.’ Asked whether he felt uncomfortable blocking the Armenian genocide resolution, Graham replied: ‘Yeah. ... I'm not going to object next time,’ Graham added."" The White House prodded Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) to object the next time, and he obliged.

-- Threatening more arrests, Iran restored Internet access in large parts of the country after a weeklong shutdown aimed at nationwide protests. From the Journal: “Tehran’s response to the unrest indicates its willingness to resort to deadly force to push back against what it sees as U.S. attempts to weaken and eventually oust the country’s leaders. It also comes amid a growing pushback in the region, where Iraqi and Lebanese protesters have railed against the influence of Iran and its local allies. … Iranian authorities haven't released an official number of arrests, but state media said authorities had arrested 180 ‘ringleaders’ and ‘rioters’ connected with such disparate groups as Islamic State, the MeK and Kurdish militants. Iran’s internet blackout stemmed the sharing of videos and photos of the demonstrations, helping contain coverage to inside Iran, while making it difficult for those outside the country to assess the state of the protests and the brutal crackdown.”

-- Reuters chronicles the role Iran’s leaders had in plotting the September attacks on the world’s biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. “This account [was] described to Reuters by three officials familiar with the meetings and a fourth close to Iran’s decision making … These people said Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved the operation, but with strict conditions: Iranian forces must avoid hitting any civilians or Americans. … The plan by Iranian military leaders to strike Saudi oil installations developed over several months, according to the official close to Iran’s decision making. … The official close to Iran’s decision making said the group settled on the plan to attack Saudi Arabia’s oil installations because it could grab big headlines, inflict economic pain on an adversary and still deliver a strong message to Washington.”

-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces his first serious leadership challenge from his own party. Ruth Eglash reports: “The first public cracks in [Netanyahu]’s Likud party appeared over the weekend, days after the country’s attorney general indicted the longtime leader on charges of bribery and fraud in three criminal cases. The move comes after a year of political limbo that could send Israelis back to the polls for an unprecedented third general election in less than a year. Gideon Saar, Netanyahu’s most outspoken challenger within Likud, told an Israeli news show Saturday that it was time for the party to hold primaries to decide its leader and keep it from losing power. Saar, a 52-year-old former minister who returned to politics last year after a four-year hiatus, said he himself could end the political crisis. On Sunday, he submitted a request to the party’s central committee calling for a leadership vote to be held in the next three weeks — the deadline for the country’s lawmakers to form a long-elusive government before another general election must be called.”

-- Uber lost its license to operate in London after authorities discovered that more than 14,000 trips were taken with uninsured drivers. From the Guardian: “Transport for London announced the decision not to renew the global ride-hailing firm’s licence at the end of a two-month probationary extension granted in September. Uber was then told it needed to address issues with checks on drivers, insurance and safety, but has apparently failed to satisfy the capital’s transport authorities. … The decision is unlikely to see Uber cars disappear from London, as the firm is expected to appeal, and can continue to operate pending the outcome, provided it launches official proceedings within 21 days.”

-- Not only will England’s Prince Andrew stand aside from all of his 230 patronages after a scandalous interview about his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he also won’t be able to throw a birthday bash next year, under orders from the Queen. From the Guardian: “The blanket move represents a key step in Buckingham Palace’s attempts to limit the damage to the British monarchy from the prince’s association with Epstein and his interview with BBC Two’s Newsnight last weekend in which he was widely thought to have shown insufficient concern for Epstein’s victims. … Andrew’s withdrawal from public life coincides with Charles’s wish for a more streamlined and cost-effective monarchy when he becomes king. Sources close to the Prince of Wales, who is on an official visit to the Solomon Islands, denied reports that he was ‘angry and frustrated’ by the publicity his younger brother was attracting. It was also reported that the Queen has cancelled a planned 60th birthday party for Andrew in February and has downsized it to a small family gathering.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg officially announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Michael Scherer reports: “Bloomberg has promised a disruptive campaign that could break spending records with a massive advertising buy aimed at states that vote in March and April. … Without offering specifics, the announcement video says he will push for the wealthy to pay more in taxes and to guarantee health care to all Americans without removing private insurance from anyone who wants it. His campaign has made more than $30 million in television advertising reservations to help introduce him as a candidate. The ads will start [today]. … Bloomberg has also announced a $100 million ad campaign to criticize Trump in key battleground states and a $15 million voter registration effort in those same places. Those initial spending plans are already double the amount raised by the top fundraiser in the Democratic field, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), through September.”

-- The billionaire’s news outlet, Bloomberg News, announced it will stop writing unsigned editorials about its founder and its reporters will avoid investigating him or his Democratic rivals as long as he stays in the race. Paul Farhi reports: “In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations … Micklethwait’s memo Sunday laid out what he called ‘basic principles’ in covering Bloomberg’s political aspirations. Most notably, he said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’ A Bloomberg News spokeswoman, Kerri Chyka, also said the company won’t initiate stories about Bloomberg L.P., following a long-standing policy. The hands-off policy puts Bloomberg News in the awkward position of passing on such critical stories as Trump’s unfounded allegations of corruption against [Biden] and his son Hunter. At the same time, Micklethwait said Bloomberg News would continue to investigate the Trump administration.”

-- “America already elected a builder,” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said of Bloomberg’s announcement, which uses the tagline “Rebuild America.” “His new ad that he put millions behind is all unicorns and rainbows. Keep your health care if you'd like to — and if you don't, I have something better. Rebuild America. We heard that from Obama-Biden,” Conway said. (Politico)

-- Biden is struggling in Iowa and his supporters blame a lack of enthusiasm and a spotty campaign operation. From the Times: “Voters at Mr. Biden’s events, along with county chairs and party strategists, characterize his on-the-ground organization as scattershot, visibly present in some counties but barely detectable in others. His events are often relatively small and sometimes subdued affairs, and in a state where enthusiasm can make or break a candidate on caucus night — a big part of caucusing centers on persuading friends and neighbors — Mr. Biden’s operation has found it difficult to build contagious excitement, these Democrats say. … ‘This is prime political season in Iowa and most candidates are spending a good deal of time visiting Iowa,’ said Joey Norris, the Democratic chair in Montgomery County, Iowa, where [Pete] Buttigieg plans to campaign on Monday. ‘The Biden campaign has been notably absent.’”

-- Sanders’s loyal voters could keep him in the race for months. From the Journal: “Sanders’s campaign has made it clear that to win the nomination, he would have to pull off an ambitious expansion of the electorate. His campaign says it is banking on turning out a coalition of young, working-class and minority voters. But polls show the Vermont independent’s base is more loyal than that of any other 2020 Democrat, and in interviews over the last four months, Mr. Sanders’s supporters [have said] that they wouldn’t support any other candidate as long as he is running. Those backers—and his massive fundraising—mean that, unlike many of his rivals, Mr. Sanders might not need a marquee win in an early state to stay in the presidential race for months.”

-- Sen. Cory Booker keeps winning praise for his presidential campaign. What he’s not winning is much support. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Michael Scherer report: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”

-- Sarah Sanders left Washington less than six months ago. Now the former White House press secretary has returned to Arkansas in search for a new political role. From the Times: “‘There are two types of people who run for office,’ Ms. Sanders said over breakfast tacos at a diner in downtown Little Rock last week. ‘People that are called and people that just want to be a senator or governor. I feel like I’ve been called.’ ... As the daughter of Mike Huckabee, who served as governor from 1996 to 2007 and twice ran for president, she is seen as political royalty in Arkansas, and Mr. Trump himself urged her to run for governor when she left the West Wing. That job will open in 2023, when Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s term is up, and Ms. Sanders is giving every indication that she plans to run. …

“In the 23 months that Ms. Sanders served as Mr. Trump’s chief spokeswoman, her battles with the White House press corps were epic. … Ms. Sanders’s relationship with reporters reached a nadir in April after it was revealed that she had admitted under oath to investigators working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that her claim at a press briefing that ‘countless members of the F.B.I.’ told her they had lost confidence in the bureau’s director, James B. Comey, was a ‘slip of the tongue’ that was not based on any facts. … ‘I was attacked for everything, not just my performance,’ she said of her time in Washington. ‘I was called a fat soccer mom, my kids were threatened, my life was threatened. It was a lot. I hate harping on it, but to be in the position I’m in and to have Secret Service, that’s not normal.’ Ms. Sanders paused. ‘I don’t like being called a liar,’ she said.""

-- Doctors who previously worked at the White House and those who are currently in touch with the White House said the mysterious and unannounced visit Trump made to the hospital last weekend was highly unusual. From CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta: “Given that the White House had previously given plenty of advance notice about the President's past physical exams, last weekend's visit to Walter Reed reportedly took everyone by surprise, including much of the staff at the hospital itself. Whenever the President is planning a visit to Walter Reed, an institution-wide notice goes out, making staff aware of certain road and corridor closings. According to a person familiar with the matter, that didn't happen last weekend. Also striking: the fact that the president's physician, Dr. Sean Conley, rode with Trump in the presidential motorcade. Typically, the doctor rides separately from the President for security reasons. A former White House doctor [said] it had never happened during their time there. …

""All tests Conley described could've been performed at the White House instead of the hospital. Many blood tests require the patient to fast overnight and are thus performed first thing in the morning -- not in the middle of the afternoon, as apparently happened with the President. And remember, the President had these tests just nine months ago. One of the reasons doctors wait a year to order labs for a routine physical is to better assess the impact of medication and lifestyle changes over a consistent interval of time. There is no benefit to drawing the blood early, unless there is a concern about something. Finally, there is no such thing as a phased physical exam, as Trump had described it in his tweet from last weekend.”

-- Another health scare: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from the hospital on Sunday after going in with chills and a fever. Robert Barnes reports: “The court announced in a news release Saturday evening that the 86-year-old had been seen at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington and then transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where doctors were more familiar with her medical history. She was treated for a possible infection. 'With intravenous antibiotics and fluids, her symptoms have abated,' the court said in the Saturday release. The court provided no other details.”

AD

“When you see me, you would know that I’m African American from day one,” said Davis, who has endorsed former vice president Joe Biden. “When someone is gay or a lesbian, unless they tell or they are seen in certain situations, then no one is going to know that. They are able to build their résumés and build their career.”

AD

LGBT activists see something different in Buttigieg — a barrier-breaker from a group that has long faced bigotry and violence, a face of the latest struggle for inclusion. And while some successfully conceal their difference, say leaders of the movement for gay equality, that decision can come with its own steep costs.

Evan Wolfson, founder of Freedom to Marry, which helped lead the fight for same-sex marriage, said Buttigieg’s message is not “an attempt to appropriate someone else’s experience.” Rather, he said, the mayor is saying that “because he, too, has had to deal with his own struggles, that has made him more aware of the need to connect with the struggles of others.”

AD

That question — how to square Buttigieg’s privileges with the adversity that comes with anti-gay prejudice — is becoming sharper as the 37-year-old Afghan war veteran rises in the polls and scrambles for ways to connect with black voters. And it renews the issue of how Americans, of any background, will respond to the candidacy of an openly gay man, one who holds hands with his husband and publicly discusses his decision to come out.

AD

The debates are unfolding against a significant shift in the politics of identity. The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements continue to resonate, and the successful push for marriage equality hardly marked the culmination of the quest for a fuller set of LGBT rights. As President Trump inflames America’s divides, the Democratic Party is fielding the most diverse set of presidential candidates in history.

Buttigieg has shot to the top of the polls in Iowa and is gaining strength in New Hampshire, two largely white states — but he trails badly in South Carolina, the first primary state with a sizable African American population. A recent poll gave him less than 1 percent support among black Democrats there.

AD

The mayor’s current efforts to find common ground are prompting raw feelings, including his comments at the last Democratic debate when the question of race arose.

AD

“While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me,” Buttigieg said.

That drew a sharp response, including from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful and the only black woman in the U.S. Senate. “What he did on the stage, it’s just not productive, and I think it’s a bit naive,” she told CNN after the debate.

AD

Other African Americans agreed, feeling that Buttigieg was implicitly comparing his experience to the unique struggle of black Americans, in a misguided effort to show his empathy.

AD

“I think Kamala had a point, and I understood what she was saying,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, said in an interview, though he added that Buttigieg had been misunderstood.

He said Buttigieg is doing his best to reach out. “He’s evolving,” Sharpton said. “Do I think he’s where he needs to be? No.”

The prospect of tension between the black and gay communities worries some people in both groups. “Can’t y’all stop this mess?” Alvin McEwen, a black LGBT activist from South Carolina, recalled thinking to himself amid the furor following Buttigieg’s comments.

AD

“No group wants to have the autonomy of their narrative taken by another group,” McEwen said. “But it also typifies how both communities want to grab on to power and don’t want to listen to each other.”

Asked about the comments during his recent campaign swing in western Iowa, Buttigieg said he was not trying to compare the black and gay experiences, only to say that he is driven to fight for African Americans the way others have fought for him.

AD

“It was people like me and people not like me who came together — starting before I was born and through my lifetime — who have made it possible for things like my marriage to exist, or honestly for somebody like me to even be taken seriously as a candidate for president,” Buttigieg said.

AD

“Having seen that, having seen how that alliance can make an impact, makes me reflect on how I can turn around and make myself useful, not only to the LGBT community but to people whose life experiences are very different,” he added.

That resonates with many in the gay rights community. Matt Foreman, program director of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, which advocates for marriage equality, among other causes, said it’s not a given that being gay gives someone greater empathy for the struggles of people of color.

AD

“But it should,” he said. “It can’t be the same, because you can never get inside anyone else’s skin. But I see that in a lot of LGBT organizations and their sincere commitment to helping address systemic racism.”

AD

Foreman acknowledged that LGBT groups have sometimes fallen short. “We as members of the gay movement have often failed to appreciate the need to be there for other communities,” he said. He cited police shootings, which sometimes prompt an outcry among gay activists and other times a reaction that “this isn’t our issue.”

Wolfson, of Freedom to Marry — now defunct, having attained its goal — said the unhappiness with Buttigieg among many black voters, including in his hometown of South Bend, illustrates that the mayor “undoubtedly has more work to do.”

Adding to his challenges, Buttigieg was forced to respond recently to a harshly worded article in the African American-oriented website the Root, which denounced Buttigieg’s comments from years ago that part of black students’ problem is a lack of successful role models. The author, Michael Harriot, called Buttigieg a liar for omitting the role of systemic racism.

AD

AD

Buttigieg on Tuesday called Harriot to explain his remarks and listen to his critic’s views. And when a voter asked Buttigieg about the article at a town hall in Sioux City, Iowa, the candidate said the author had been right, adding, “We’ve got to look at the structural factors that drive different racial outcomes in our country.”

He also cited his “Douglass Plan” for tackling institutional racism, a proposal for sweeping changes in health care, education, employment and criminal justice, among other areas.

As an ongoing part of his outreach, Buttigieg plans to worship Sunday at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, N.C., which is led by the Rev. William Barber II, a well-known minister and activist.

Barber said in an interview that in today’s polarized climate, candidates are often surprised to find so much diversity in his church — blacks, whites, gays, lesbians.

AD

“Let’s not get caught up in who understands discrimination the most,” Barber said. “Let’s deal with the real issue, which is that the same entities that are against gay folks are the same entities who are against black folks, and that we ought to be united in fighting discrimination in any form it arises.”

Buttigieg from the outset of his campaign sought guidance in how to frame his gay identity when talking with black voters. Two weeks after announcing his run for president, he lunched with Sharpton at Sylvia’s, a famous restaurant in Harlem.

“He wanted to genuinely know how I felt the African American community would relate to an LGBT candidate,” Sharpton said. The activist told Buttigieg something other black leaders have also said — that the level of homophobia in the black community has been greatly overstated.

McEwen said it is clear why some black voters are hesitant to support Buttigieg, noting that many of his qualifications are shared by a female candidate or a person of color, yet they have received far less buzz. He served in the military, but so did Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). He made a name in local politics, but so did Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

“I think the fact that he’s a white male is a far bigger problem than being gay among blacks in South Carolina,” McEwen said. “Because of the white male power structure, he’s gotten a lot more public attention than people who are senators. He’s only been a mayor.”

Beyond that, black voters give various reasons for distrusting Buttigieg, including his handling of race relations in South Bend. But a recurring theme is the sense that Buttigieg benefits from his privileged status without recognizing that he enjoys these advantages.

Buttigieg denies that, saying he is well aware of his advantages, and this week he pledged “increased engagement and new forms of engagement,” though he did not go into detail.

Buttigieg has also said his challenge with black voters is that few know him. But his detractors say they know exactly who he is: a well-intentioned white liberal who credits himself with more insight into the black predicament than he has."

Incumbency has an advantage, yes, but how does that advantage play out for a president who’s never been above the mid-40s in approval and who may be facing off against a much more positively viewed Democratic nominee?

New polling from CNN and its partners at SSRS offers a partial answer to that latter question: On several key leadership traits, leading Democratic candidates aren’t viewed that much more positively than Trump.

AD

AD

It varies by candidate, of course. Take the question of whether a candidate “can manage the government effectively.” About 40 percent of respondents thought that described Trump, down from 50 percent who said so during the presidential transition.

Former vice president Joe Biden earns much higher marks on the question, with more than half of respondents saying he could manage government effectively. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are seen as about as capable as Trump. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg does slightly worse.

Interestingly — and ominously, for Democrats — Trump fares about as well as most of his potential opponents on the question of being able to “bring the kind of change the country needs.” Here again, Buttigieg trails Trump.

CNN added a new question in this poll that seems to be targeting questions about Biden: Does the candidate have the sharpness and stamina to be president? Biden and Buttigieg fare about as well as Trump while Warren has an advantage. Sanders, perhaps because of his recent heart attack, trails somewhat behind.

On two questions, though, the Democrats have consistent advantages over Trump. Biden and Sanders are seen as being much more likely to unite the country than Trump, for example. This is the question on which Trump fares the most poorly, with optimism about his ability to unite the U.S. that was demonstrated during the presidential transition quickly fading.

Democrats across the board are seen as more honest and trustworthy than Trump, with Sanders holding a massive advantage on this question.

This was one area where views of Clinton eroded over time. In September 2016, Trump and Clinton were viewed as equally honest according to Post-ABC News polling; a month later, Trump actually had an advantage. This was a function of a concerted effort by Trump and, to some extent, a willingness of voters to give him the benefit of the doubt — though views of his honesty were about the same during the campaign as they are now in CNN’s polling.

AD

AD

Honesty is an important metric, one that overlaps with favorability. Trump’s campaign will certainly try to drag down views of the honesty of his eventual opponent. But at this point in the 2016 cycle, Clinton’s honesty was already viewed as suspect, with only 35 percent of respondents in a November 2015 Fox News poll identifying her as honest and trustworthy.

Voters may see Trump and leading Democrats as equivalent on bringing needed change or effective management, but if those gaps on honesty persist, there’s a substantial distinction between the candidates that will probably play to Trump’s disadvantage.

Mike Bloomberg speaks to the media in Phoenix on Tuesday. (Rick Scuteri/AP)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had spent nearly 11 months running for president, almost none of it attacking a rival Democratic candidate by name. She'd reserved her ire for billionaires, shaming Facebook investor Peter Thiel and JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon in her first — so far, only — negative ad. Even when she'd criticized Joe Biden for allegedly “repeating Republican talking points” about heath care, his name slipped out just once, and she dropped that line when Biden pushed back.

Mike Bloomberg is getting some different treatment. On Monday, Warren cheerfully informed an Ankeny, Iowa, audience that it was “day two of Michael Bloomberg’s $37 million ad buy,” saying that was no good for anyone.

“Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020,” Warren continued, at an event focused on her own campaign's volunteers. “His view is that he doesn't need people who knock on doors. He doesn't need to get out and campaign with people. He doesn't need volunteers. And if you get out and knock on 1,000 doors, he'll just spend another $37 million to flood the airways. And that's how he plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party. I think it's fundamentally wrong.”

In his first hours as a candidate for president, Bloomberg has become what the crowded Democratic primary lacked: a pincushion. The latest Democrat to enter the race is offering a campaign of unlimited resources, attempting to hack around the primary system to skip to the expensive general election. It's a direct challenge to the primacy of Iowa and New Hampshire, which some Democrats are fine with. It's also a replacement for the sort of mass organizing and intersectional alliance-building that many Democrats and liberals, led by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), see as the only way to regain power.

“I don't think, at the end of the day, most Democrats are focused on any particular policy other than removing this man from office,” Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, told MSNBC on Monday. “No one's campaigning in the only [states] that matter: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona. Those are the only states that matter in the general election.”

Sheekey was incorrect: Multiple candidates have stumped in those swing states, including Sanders and Warren. That campaigning has taken the form of town halls and rallies with thousands of attendees, as well as small meet-and-greets or labor solidarity events. With less fanfare, the biggest campaigns are also holding daily organizing parties across the country to build post-Iowa operations that could one day be retooled for a general election. Earlier this month, when 1,000 “barnstormers” traveled to Iowa to help Pete Buttigieg, they were advertising the candidate's grass-roots network outside early-voting states.

There is no such grass-roots movement for Bloomberg, despite years of fitful work at creating one. Unity '08 and Americans Elect were launched in 2008 and 2012 to help a potential third-party candidate appear on state ballots, work that collapsed when no candidate of Bloomberg's wealth and stature decided to run. (He officially abandoned the third-party dream after 2016.) Bloomberg's campaign events have flaunted his uniqueness: quick trips to the states, such as Arkansas or Virginia, where he needs to file for the ballot, followed by lunch with local leaders.

Bloomberg's ad buys have touched markets and states that no other candidate was planning to invest in yet. It has the look of a national election, when candidates no longer spend hours talking to voters in diners or VFW halls, and for some in the states, it had upsides.

“Honestly, people appreciated that he came to the state,” said Michael John Gray, the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party. “Unfortunately, when you live in a state run by a Republican majority, sometimes you only see Democrats framed the way Republicans want to frame them. We haven't seen anything like Bloomberg's $250,000 investment here; I mean, that'd be like a $2 million investment elsewhere. That will benefit the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates.”

Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of Texas's Democratic Party, said Bloomberg was simply being smart by investing in states such as his.

“There’s a handful of delegates in New Hampshire and Iowa, and a potful of gold of delegates in Texas and California,” Hinojosa said. “If Mr. Bloomberg is willing to spend that money and make that kind of investment, he’ll be the first Democrat of my lifetime to do it in Texas. Last time around, Hillary Clinton spend $250,000 to buy a little bit of radio here.”

Bloomberg, who has spent personal money to elect both Democrats and Republicans, is uninterested in any argument about campaign financing. Just as Joe Biden did when he ended his opposition to a super PAC, Bloomberg is asking Democrats to think about what a general election really looks like and whether they really want purity when they could have a machine dedicated to ousting Trump.

But Warren and Sanders have turned their small-dollar fundraising into the case for their candidacies; Sanders points out frequently that he has more individual donations than Trump does. Bloomberg has sworn off campaign donations, rejecting the modern Democratic argument — captured by the party's donors-and-polls debate threshold — that small-dollar support is proof that a candidate is competitive.

“This is the arrogance of billionaires,” Sanders told voters in New Hampshire this past weekend. "" ‘Hey, I can run for president because I’m worth $55 billion, and maybe I’ll take $1 billion out of that $55 billion’— not a lot, when you’re worth that much — 'and start running a massive amount of TV ads.'”

The irony in this criticism, from Sanders and Warren, is that neither campaign sees Bloomberg's entry as a problem for them. The former mayor of New York City was urged into the contest, in part, by moderate Democrats worrying about whether former vice president Joe Biden could push past the better-funded Warren or Sanders. At his Virginia stop, Bloomberg both defended his campaign spending (“I've been using my resources for the things that matter to me”) and acknowledged that he was getting high-level interest.

“I was lucky enough to receive some very flattering calls that will just stay between me and whoever made the call,” Bloomberg said. “I didn't grow up in a world where I knew famous people. And when you get a call from one of them, I still pinch myself a little bit.”

For many Democrats, Bloomberg has been on firmer footing when dismissing the role of New Hampshire and Iowa in the primary process by declining to compete for either. Democratic thinking about the first two states, with electorates much whiter than the party as a whole, is conflicted. On Friday, when asked whether Bloomberg was insulting Iowa, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) turned the conversation to campaign finance reform in general.

“The average American is going to make their decision,” she said, “but I know that the average American wants there to be campaign finance reform. We know that whoever you are, we have to get money out of politics. It should not be a function of how much money you have.”

A couple of days later, when a voter put the Bloomberg question directly to Buttigieg, the Indiana mayor was diplomatic. “It's not my place to tell any other campaign what to do,” he said. “As the very first in the nation, you get such a big say on who gets to move on.”

Rejecting donations will keep Bloomberg off December's debate stage, and he has not reached a high enough level in public polls to qualify, anyway. The 17 Democrats running against him are generally viewed more favorably by the party's voters.

“Which version of our democracy is going to win?” Warren asked in Ankeny. “If Michael Bloomberg's version of democracy wins, then democracy changes, and it's going to be about which billionaire you can stomach going forward. Because believe me, I've heard plenty of billionaires who think they should be president, or at the minimum should be picking the president.""

Bloomberg has not done much, yet, to push back against the idea that he's offering Democrats a buyout. Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who endorsed Harris for president in September, did not know that Bloomberg was spending Tuesday in his home state until The Post asked him about the visit.

“The upside is that it brings more attention to our state, [but] I can't say if he will be rewarded,” Gallego said. “I don’t understand why Bloomberg is jumping in. We have winning candidates right now. I endorsed Kamala Harris specifically because I think she can put the coalition together to win. I have doubts Bloomberg can.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Bernie Sanders, “Big Us.” The messaging in this latest Iowa spot is delivered entirely by a farmer who makes a nearly nonideological case for Sanders. Polling has found that he does better on questions of “trust” than he does in a pure horse race. The arguments for Sanders here combine the left's political demons with the right's: “He’s not there for Wall Street. He’s not there for Hollywood. He’s not there for Big Oil, or big pharma or big anybody. Just Big Us.”

Joe Biden, “Commander in Chief."" The Biden pitch in Iowa has distinguished him from Democrats on something immutable: He has been vice president, and nobody else has. The potential comfort of replacing Trump with Barack Obama's running mate is the entire focus of this spot, more than a particular foreign policy issue: Biden would, in his words, “stand with our allies” and “know them by their first names.”

Elizabeth Warren, “Climate.” The senator's first spot in Iowa was a detailed look at her Social Security expansion plan; her second spot is a broader pitch for her climate change plans, which include a Green New Deal and are centered on domestic job creation. It's a lot like a spot Sanders previously ran in the state, though Warren seems to have hit on the concise plan ad as her strategy, now that she's on the air.

Club for Growth, “Foreign."" The conservative PAC is trying to shape Alabama's wide-open Senate primary, which was reshaped this month when Jeff Sessions returned to run again. This spot targets Rep. Bradley Byrne, one of the first Chamber of Commerce-friendly candidates who defeated a more conservative challenger in the 2014 cycle. Byrne has since rebranded himself as a Trump ally, and the Club is trying to cut into that armor by attacking Byrne's reliable vote for Republican leadership in the House, specifically to keep the Export-Import Bank active.

The Sanders campaign, which had put up with a few weeks of speculation on whether he was falling out of contention, has celebrated this poll for good reason. It's the second in one month to show him in a lead, albeit bunched up with a few other candidates. Where it differs from those polls: Sanders's own support has remained steady, with no obvious movement since the summer. Just a few trajectories have changed dramatically: Biden and Harris have lost support, Buttigieg has gained it, and both Yang and Gabbard have ticked up as fewer voters became undecided. That could affect the Sanders campaign in ways not worth predicting until after Iowa: His supporters from 2016 have been the most interested in Yang's and Gabbard's sort of anti-establishment candidacies.

At the start of this month, Warren released her Medicare-for-all payment plan; two weeks later, she released a two-part transition plan. In the details, both get closer to what Democratic voters say they prefer, with a single-payer health plan on the horizon after more people are enrolled in Medicare. But every poll has found the same voters getting skittish about Warren herself; here, her steady progress on the question of which candidate could beat the president has retreated to what it was this summer.

There's been little movement in any impeachment polling since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) first announced her support for an inquiry. Small moves in the basic question — should the president be removed from office — have been over-read as the surge of new impeachment support, or as the complete collapse of the Democrats' strategy. This is as much movement as we've seen, with voters ready to believe that the president committed a crime but unsure of what to do about it.

IN THE STATES

Arkansas. Democrats, who held both of the state's Senate seats at the start of this decade, will not field a challenger to Republican Sen. Tom Cotton. Democrat Josh Mahony, who had been running alone for the party's nomination, quit the race right after the filing deadline, citing unspecified personal reasons.

Michigan. Republicans hit a setback in their legal battle to stop a voter-created redistricting commission from drawing the state's next electoral maps, after the Western District of Michigan ruled against them. Republican plaintiffs argued that, by preventing Michiganders with political ties from serving on the commission, the First Amendment rights of potential mapmakers were being infringed. The court didn't bite, writing that “while the First Amendment is a check on the State’s authority, the State’s interests in designating eligibility criteria for an effective redistricting commission are, on balance, more than sufficient to justify the challenged provisions.”

2020

Joe Biden. He picked up the endorsement of Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada, the first member of the state's lopsidedly Democratic congressional delegation to support a candidate. He was also involved in a back-and-forth with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, after Biden said he was disappointed in his former colleague for calling for an investigation into his son, Hunter. “It's not going to work,” Graham told NBC News. “I like Joe Biden, you know, all I can say is that Joe didn't pull any punches when he ran against [John] McCain; that's the way the system works.”

Pete Buttigieg. He was endorsed by Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York and Rep. Pete Visclosky of Indiana, the second and third members of Congress to support him. He had just one congressional endorsement until this week, far behind the other high-polling candidates.

Deval Patrick. He spoke at New Hampshire's “Politics and Eggs” breakfast, playing down the difficulties of entering the race so late: “The path we knew was there is wider than I fully appreciated.” He's spending Tuesday in South Carolina, his second trip to the state in an 11-day campaign.

Tulsi Gabbard. She's holding town halls in New Hampshire, where she has been polling best, over most of Thanksgiving week: Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

Mike Bloomberg. He filed in person Tuesday for Arizona’s primary, accompanying it with another news conference in which he spelled out a health-care plan similar to Joe Biden’s (building slowly from the Affordable Care Act) and explained a bit more of his migration to the Democratic Party. “I certainly could never run as a Republican,” he said. “The old-line Republican Party was very different than the one today. I don't agree with virtually anything they stand for.”

Bernie Sanders. He’ll make a post-Thanksgiving return trip to South Carolina.

Elizabeth Warren. She sat down with the Des Moines Register’s editorial board, spelling out in more detail how she could implement a wealth tax. Europeans, she said, botched the wealth tax when they “went way too deep into the wealth range,” and Americans could grow the staff of the Internal Revenue Service to assess the property of the wealthy that would be subject to tax. “Billionaires are slippery.”

Michael Bennet. He picked up an endorsement in New Hampshire from state Rep. Joyce Fulweiler.

Cory Booker. In a new campaign memo, his team said that its focus for the next few weeks will be qualifying for the December debate. “We know the most important thing we can do for Cory Booker right now is to ensure that every dollar spent, every volunteer shift booked, every waking moment our campaign staff spends in the next two weeks is geared toward persuading voters that Cory should be their first choice in this contest.”

WAIT, WHAT?

If someone created a pool, letting people bet on which Democrat would be first to speculate about ending the impeachment inquiry, the most money may have been put on freshman members from swing districts, or one of the two Democrats (New Jersey's Jeff Van Drew and Minnesota's Collin Peterson) who rejected the inquiry in the first place.

Good news: No one lost their money. It was Rep. Brenda Lawrence of Michigan, whose district Hillary Clinton carried by 61 points, who seemed to panic about the politics of impeachment.

“We are so close to an election,” Lawrence said on this week's edition of Detroit reporter Charlie LeDuff's podcast. “I will tell you, sitting here knowing how divided this country is, I don't see the value of taking him out of office. I do see the value of putting down a marker saying his behavior is not acceptable.”

Republicans were overjoyed. Up to now, speculation about Democrats getting skittish on impeachment was just that — speculative — with anecdotes of freshmen nervous about the ads Republicans were buying in their districts. Lawrence had broken the seal, repeating a core Republican argument against impeachment while suggesting that Democrats might want to officially censure the president and move on.

As soon as the story caught fire, Lawrence flipped. “The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks,” she said in a statement. “The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.”

We're back to where we were on Monday morning: lots of scattered Democratic worries about impeachment, but no House Democrat actually calling for the party to drop it.

The Investigations

DON'T DISCUSS THIS AT THE THANKSGIVING TABLE: There are LOTS of developments in the impeachment inquiry. Before you head off into a tryptophan coma, here's what you shouldn't be talking about with that relative who disagrees with you.

A safe topic, however, might be a brainstorm on another name for Thanksgiving, since ""some people"" are apparently interested in renaming the holiday.

Three polls out this week show that Americans remain as divided as ever on whether to impeach and oust President Trump for allegedly misusing his office for political purposes. Despite the president's protestations, however, support for booting him remains steady.

The House Judiciary Committee scheduled its first hearing on impeachment for Dec. 4 and House Intelligence Chair Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said earlier this week that investigators will next week submit a report on their findings to Judiciary.

In a letter to Trump , House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) extended an invitation to the president and his counsel to participate in the hearing that will “serve as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment, as well as the Framers' intent and understanding of terms like 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'""

, House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) extended an invitation to the president and his counsel to participate in the hearing that will “serve as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment, as well as the Framers' intent and understanding of terms like 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'"" More from Nadler: “We expect to discuss the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry. We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.”

“We expect to discuss the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry. We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.” “Republicans held a similar hearing at the outset of proceedings against President Bill Clinton in 1998, and Democrats say the move is a necessary prerequisite to drafting articles of impeachment,” Politico's Kyle Cheney, Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle report.

Like that crazy uncle: In an interview with former Fox host Bill O'Reilly, Trump began to distance himself from ... Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer who witnesses have said the president directed diplomats to speak with regarding Ukraine.

O'Reilly: “Rudolph W. Giuliani, he’s your personal lawyer … Giuliani’s your personal lawyer. So you didn’t direct him to go to Ukraine to do anything or put any heat on them?”

“Rudolph W. Giuliani, he’s your personal lawyer … Giuliani’s your personal lawyer. So you didn’t direct him to go to Ukraine to do anything or put any heat on them?” Trump: “No, I didn’t direct him,” Trump replied. “But he’s a warrior. Rudy’s a warrior. Rudy went. He possibly saw something.”

“No, I didn’t direct him,” Trump replied. “But he’s a warrior. Rudy’s a warrior. Rudy went. He possibly saw something.” Giuliani issued a statement through his lawyer to Bloomberg's Justin Sink: “President is correct,” Giuliani said. “Giuliani never went to Ukraine for any probe. The information he received was given to him in U.S. by Ukrainians while Mueller probe was still ongoing and before Biden was even announced.”

At a rally in Sunrise, Fla.,, Trump maintained that his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky was “perfect” and falsely claimed impeachment polling has been bad for Democrats: Democrats are “pushing that impeachment witch hunt and a lot of bad things are happening to them,” Trump said. “Everybody said, ‘That’s really bullshit!’” he said, per our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, John Wagner, and Colby Itkowitz.

NOVEMBER 2019: Asked what Giuliani was doing in Ukraine, Trump said: “You have to ask that to Rudy.”



APRIL 2018: Asked why Michael Cohen paid off Stormy Daniels, Trump said: “You’ll have to ask Michael.” https://t.co/nZtvk19ZKR — Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) November 27, 2019

But more news broke on Tuesday painting a not-so-flattering picture for the president: The New York Times's Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes, and Maggie Haberman report that Trump “had already been briefed on a whistleblower’s complaint about his dealings with Ukraine when he unfroze military aid for the country in September, according to two people familiar with the matter.”

“The revelation could shed light on Mr. Trump’s thinking at two critical points under scrutiny by impeachment investigators: his decision in early September to release $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine and his denial to a key ambassador around the same time that there was a “quid pro quo” with Kyiv. Mr. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair,” per Schmidt, Barnes and Haberman.

Resignations at OMB: And Mark Sandy, the only Office of Management and Budget official to testify in the probe, provided closed-door testimony that concerns were so fraught over blocking security assistance to Ukraine that two officials resigned.

“Two officials at [OMB] recently resigned while voicing concerns over the holdup on Ukraine aid, a career employee of the agency told impeachment investigators, according to a transcript of his testimony released Tuesday,” our colleague Erica Werner reports.

Nevertheless, public opinion over whether Trump should be impeached remains the same as in October, despite Schiff's public hearings:

CNN: “Half of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 43% say he should not,” per CNN's Jennifer Agiesta. “Neither figure has changed since October, with support for impeachment remaining at its highest level thus far in CNN polling. The partisan divide over the president persists as well, with roughly 80 points between Democratic support for Trump's removal and Republican support for it.""

HuffPost/YouGov: “Days of televised impeachment hearings have left Americans largely dug into their original opinions, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, dashing Democrats’ hopes that the testimony might finally splinter the president’s base of support and Republicans’ predictions that the hearings would backfire on their opponents,” per HuffPost's Ariel Edwards Levy. “Republicans largely dismissed that testimony as meaningless, while Democrats heralded it as a bombshell ― a split that mirrors broader public opinion.”

This compares to a 38 — 58 percent approval rating in an October 23 poll, and falls within the range of where his job approval rating has been over about the last two years.”

The numbers still don't look good for Trump, but they definitely haven't gotten worse,” Quinnipiac analyst Tim Malloy added.

Democrats definitely don't want him at dinner: Meanwhile, colleague Josh Dawsey and I scooped on a familiar face Trump turned to last week to seek advice on impeachment: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s former top strategists.

""Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said,"" we report.

WAYBACK WEDNESDAY: The trash panda that almost became a Thanksgiving turkey. ""A Mississippi resident sent a raccoon in a top-slatted soap box to the White House in November of 1926. The idea was that the animal would be slaughtered and prepared for a Thanksgiving feast, according to news reports. But President Calvin Coolidge didn’t care for raccoon meat. Turkey would suit,"" Eliza McGraw writes for The Post.

""This was, as first lady Grace Coolidge later wrote, “no ordinary raccoon."": ""The animal was lively and seemingly tame. So instead of eating her, the Coolidges, who adored animals, kept the raccoon as a pet,"" Eliza writes. ""They named her Rebecca, and when she was indoors, she roamed the White House apartments. She liked to sit in a bathtub and play with a bar of soap.""

First lady Grace Coolidge holding her pet raccoon, Rebecca. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, LC-USZ62-100816)

Rebecca's adventures were just beginning: She ""became fodder for national conversations, if not a holiday meal. The Saturday after Thanksgiving, a cartoon in the Washington Evening Star showed a walrus-mustached man, broad-brimmed hat in hand, offering Coolidge a raccoon labeled, 'Low Tariff.' Coolidge, a proponent of high tariffs, holds his hand up in a 'halt!' gesture, saying, 'No thanks, I can’t swallow that whole.'""

Her later escapades included: Summering in the Black Hills, as humorist Will Rogers quipped, when Rebecca climbed a tree overlooking Custer Park natural zoo and refused to come down. Majority Whip John Q. Tilson and Wyoming Rep. Charles E. Winter were among those who tried to coax her down to no avail.

Charles E. Winter were among those who tried to coax her down to no avail. She was just fine with no man, thank you: "" In 1928, a White House police officer caught a male raccoon and gave him to the President to keep Rebecca company. Coolidge told reporters his name was Reuben,"" Eliza writes. ""That same day, the AP reported, the male raccoon shinnied up a tall tree on the White House lawn, and, like Rebecca, would not come down.

“When you see me, you would know that I’m African American from day one,” said Davis, who has endorsed former vice president Joe Biden. “When someone is gay or a lesbian, unless they tell or they are seen in certain situations, then no one is going to know that. They are able to build their résumés and build their career.”

AD

LGBT activists see something different in Buttigieg — a barrier-breaker from a group that has long faced bigotry and violence, a face of the latest struggle for inclusion. And while some successfully conceal their difference, say leaders of the movement for gay equality, that decision can come with its own steep costs.

Evan Wolfson, founder of Freedom to Marry, which helped lead the fight for same-sex marriage, said Buttigieg’s message is not “an attempt to appropriate someone else’s experience.” Rather, he said, the mayor is saying that “because he, too, has had to deal with his own struggles, that has made him more aware of the need to connect with the struggles of others.”

AD

That question — how to square Buttigieg’s privileges with the adversity that comes with anti-gay prejudice — is becoming sharper as the 37-year-old Afghan war veteran rises in the polls and scrambles for ways to connect with black voters. And it renews the issue of how Americans, of any background, will respond to the candidacy of an openly gay man, one who holds hands with his husband and publicly discusses his decision to come out.

AD

The debates are unfolding against a significant shift in the politics of identity. The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements continue to resonate, and the successful push for marriage equality hardly marked the culmination of the quest for a fuller set of LGBT rights. As President Trump inflames America’s divides, the Democratic Party is fielding the most diverse set of presidential candidates in history.

Buttigieg has shot to the top of the polls in Iowa and is gaining strength in New Hampshire, two largely white states — but he trails badly in South Carolina, the first primary state with a sizable African American population. A recent poll gave him less than 1 percent support among black Democrats there.

AD

The mayor’s current efforts to find common ground are prompting raw feelings, including his comments at the last Democratic debate when the question of race arose.

AD

“While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me,” Buttigieg said.

That drew a sharp response, including from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful and the only black woman in the U.S. Senate. “What he did on the stage, it’s just not productive, and I think it’s a bit naive,” she told CNN after the debate.

AD

Other African Americans agreed, feeling that Buttigieg was implicitly comparing his experience to the unique struggle of black Americans, in a misguided effort to show his empathy.

AD

“I think Kamala had a point, and I understood what she was saying,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, said in an interview, though he added that Buttigieg had been misunderstood.

He said Buttigieg is doing his best to reach out. “He’s evolving,” Sharpton said. “Do I think he’s where he needs to be? No.”

The prospect of tension between the black and gay communities worries some people in both groups. “Can’t y’all stop this mess?” Alvin McEwen, a black LGBT activist from South Carolina, recalled thinking to himself amid the furor following Buttigieg’s comments.

AD

“No group wants to have the autonomy of their narrative taken by another group,” McEwen said. “But it also typifies how both communities want to grab on to power and don’t want to listen to each other.”

Asked about the comments during his recent campaign swing in western Iowa, Buttigieg said he was not trying to compare the black and gay experiences, only to say that he is driven to fight for African Americans the way others have fought for him.

AD

“It was people like me and people not like me who came together — starting before I was born and through my lifetime — who have made it possible for things like my marriage to exist, or honestly for somebody like me to even be taken seriously as a candidate for president,” Buttigieg said.

AD

“Having seen that, having seen how that alliance can make an impact, makes me reflect on how I can turn around and make myself useful, not only to the LGBT community but to people whose life experiences are very different,” he added.

That resonates with many in the gay rights community. Matt Foreman, program director of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, which advocates for marriage equality, among other causes, said it’s not a given that being gay gives someone greater empathy for the struggles of people of color.

AD

“But it should,” he said. “It can’t be the same, because you can never get inside anyone else’s skin. But I see that in a lot of LGBT organizations and their sincere commitment to helping address systemic racism.”

AD

Foreman acknowledged that LGBT groups have sometimes fallen short. “We as members of the gay movement have often failed to appreciate the need to be there for other communities,” he said. He cited police shootings, which sometimes prompt an outcry among gay activists and other times a reaction that “this isn’t our issue.”

Wolfson, of Freedom to Marry — now defunct, having attained its goal — said the unhappiness with Buttigieg among many black voters, including in his hometown of South Bend, illustrates that the mayor “undoubtedly has more work to do.”

Adding to his challenges, Buttigieg was forced to respond recently to a harshly worded article in the African American-oriented website the Root, which denounced Buttigieg’s comments from years ago that part of black students’ problem is a lack of successful role models. The author, Michael Harriot, called Buttigieg a liar for omitting the role of systemic racism.

AD

AD

Buttigieg on Tuesday called Harriot to explain his remarks and listen to his critic’s views. And when a voter asked Buttigieg about the article at a town hall in Sioux City, Iowa, the candidate said the author had been right, adding, “We’ve got to look at the structural factors that drive different racial outcomes in our country.”

He also cited his “Douglass Plan” for tackling institutional racism, a proposal for sweeping changes in health care, education, employment and criminal justice, among other areas.

As an ongoing part of his outreach, Buttigieg plans to worship Sunday at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, N.C., which is led by the Rev. William Barber II, a well-known minister and activist.

Barber said in an interview that in today’s polarized climate, candidates are often surprised to find so much diversity in his church — blacks, whites, gays, lesbians.

AD

“Let’s not get caught up in who understands discrimination the most,” Barber said. “Let’s deal with the real issue, which is that the same entities that are against gay folks are the same entities who are against black folks, and that we ought to be united in fighting discrimination in any form it arises.”

Buttigieg from the outset of his campaign sought guidance in how to frame his gay identity when talking with black voters. Two weeks after announcing his run for president, he lunched with Sharpton at Sylvia’s, a famous restaurant in Harlem.

“He wanted to genuinely know how I felt the African American community would relate to an LGBT candidate,” Sharpton said. The activist told Buttigieg something other black leaders have also said — that the level of homophobia in the black community has been greatly overstated.

McEwen said it is clear why some black voters are hesitant to support Buttigieg, noting that many of his qualifications are shared by a female candidate or a person of color, yet they have received far less buzz. He served in the military, but so did Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). He made a name in local politics, but so did Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

“I think the fact that he’s a white male is a far bigger problem than being gay among blacks in South Carolina,” McEwen said. “Because of the white male power structure, he’s gotten a lot more public attention than people who are senators. He’s only been a mayor.”

Beyond that, black voters give various reasons for distrusting Buttigieg, including his handling of race relations in South Bend. But a recurring theme is the sense that Buttigieg benefits from his privileged status without recognizing that he enjoys these advantages.

Buttigieg denies that, saying he is well aware of his advantages, and this week he pledged “increased engagement and new forms of engagement,” though he did not go into detail.

Buttigieg has also said his challenge with black voters is that few know him. But his detractors say they know exactly who he is: a well-intentioned white liberal who credits himself with more insight into the black predicament than he has."

Incumbency has an advantage, yes, but how does that advantage play out for a president who’s never been above the mid-40s in approval and who may be facing off against a much more positively viewed Democratic nominee?

New polling from CNN and its partners at SSRS offers a partial answer to that latter question: On several key leadership traits, leading Democratic candidates aren’t viewed that much more positively than Trump.

AD

AD

It varies by candidate, of course. Take the question of whether a candidate “can manage the government effectively.” About 40 percent of respondents thought that described Trump, down from 50 percent who said so during the presidential transition.

Former vice president Joe Biden earns much higher marks on the question, with more than half of respondents saying he could manage government effectively. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are seen as about as capable as Trump. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg does slightly worse.

Interestingly — and ominously, for Democrats — Trump fares about as well as most of his potential opponents on the question of being able to “bring the kind of change the country needs.” Here again, Buttigieg trails Trump.

CNN added a new question in this poll that seems to be targeting questions about Biden: Does the candidate have the sharpness and stamina to be president? Biden and Buttigieg fare about as well as Trump while Warren has an advantage. Sanders, perhaps because of his recent heart attack, trails somewhat behind.

On two questions, though, the Democrats have consistent advantages over Trump. Biden and Sanders are seen as being much more likely to unite the country than Trump, for example. This is the question on which Trump fares the most poorly, with optimism about his ability to unite the U.S. that was demonstrated during the presidential transition quickly fading.

Democrats across the board are seen as more honest and trustworthy than Trump, with Sanders holding a massive advantage on this question.

This was one area where views of Clinton eroded over time. In September 2016, Trump and Clinton were viewed as equally honest according to Post-ABC News polling; a month later, Trump actually had an advantage. This was a function of a concerted effort by Trump and, to some extent, a willingness of voters to give him the benefit of the doubt — though views of his honesty were about the same during the campaign as they are now in CNN’s polling.

AD

AD

Honesty is an important metric, one that overlaps with favorability. Trump’s campaign will certainly try to drag down views of the honesty of his eventual opponent. But at this point in the 2016 cycle, Clinton’s honesty was already viewed as suspect, with only 35 percent of respondents in a November 2015 Fox News poll identifying her as honest and trustworthy.

Voters may see Trump and leading Democrats as equivalent on bringing needed change or effective management, but if those gaps on honesty persist, there’s a substantial distinction between the candidates that will probably play to Trump’s disadvantage.

The Investigations

DON'T DISCUSS THIS AT THE THANKSGIVING TABLE: There are LOTS of developments in the impeachment inquiry. Before you head off into a tryptophan coma, here's what you shouldn't be talking about with that relative who disagrees with you.

A safe topic, however, might be a brainstorm on another name for Thanksgiving, since ""some people"" are apparently interested in renaming the holiday.

Three polls out this week show that Americans remain as divided as ever on whether to impeach and oust President Trump for allegedly misusing his office for political purposes. Despite the president's protestations, however, support for booting him remains steady.

The House Judiciary Committee scheduled its first hearing on impeachment for Dec. 4 and House Intelligence Chair Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said earlier this week that investigators will next week submit a report on their findings to Judiciary.

In a letter to Trump , House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) extended an invitation to the president and his counsel to participate in the hearing that will “serve as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment, as well as the Framers' intent and understanding of terms like 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'""

, House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) extended an invitation to the president and his counsel to participate in the hearing that will “serve as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment, as well as the Framers' intent and understanding of terms like 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'"" More from Nadler: “We expect to discuss the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry. We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.”

“We expect to discuss the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry. We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.” “Republicans held a similar hearing at the outset of proceedings against President Bill Clinton in 1998, and Democrats say the move is a necessary prerequisite to drafting articles of impeachment,” Politico's Kyle Cheney, Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle report.

Like that crazy uncle: In an interview with former Fox host Bill O'Reilly, Trump began to distance himself from ... Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer who witnesses have said the president directed diplomats to speak with regarding Ukraine.

O'Reilly: “Rudolph W. Giuliani, he’s your personal lawyer … Giuliani’s your personal lawyer. So you didn’t direct him to go to Ukraine to do anything or put any heat on them?”

“Rudolph W. Giuliani, he’s your personal lawyer … Giuliani’s your personal lawyer. So you didn’t direct him to go to Ukraine to do anything or put any heat on them?” Trump: “No, I didn’t direct him,” Trump replied. “But he’s a warrior. Rudy’s a warrior. Rudy went. He possibly saw something.”

“No, I didn’t direct him,” Trump replied. “But he’s a warrior. Rudy’s a warrior. Rudy went. He possibly saw something.” Giuliani issued a statement through his lawyer to Bloomberg's Justin Sink: “President is correct,” Giuliani said. “Giuliani never went to Ukraine for any probe. The information he received was given to him in U.S. by Ukrainians while Mueller probe was still ongoing and before Biden was even announced.”

At a rally in Sunrise, Fla.,, Trump maintained that his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky was “perfect” and falsely claimed impeachment polling has been bad for Democrats: Democrats are “pushing that impeachment witch hunt and a lot of bad things are happening to them,” Trump said. “Everybody said, ‘That’s really bullshit!’” he said, per our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, John Wagner, and Colby Itkowitz.

NOVEMBER 2019: Asked what Giuliani was doing in Ukraine, Trump said: “You have to ask that to Rudy.”



APRIL 2018: Asked why Michael Cohen paid off Stormy Daniels, Trump said: “You’ll have to ask Michael.” https://t.co/nZtvk19ZKR — Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) November 27, 2019

But more news broke on Tuesday painting a not-so-flattering picture for the president: The New York Times's Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes, and Maggie Haberman report that Trump “had already been briefed on a whistleblower’s complaint about his dealings with Ukraine when he unfroze military aid for the country in September, according to two people familiar with the matter.”

“The revelation could shed light on Mr. Trump’s thinking at two critical points under scrutiny by impeachment investigators: his decision in early September to release $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine and his denial to a key ambassador around the same time that there was a “quid pro quo” with Kyiv. Mr. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair,” per Schmidt, Barnes and Haberman.

Resignations at OMB: And Mark Sandy, the only Office of Management and Budget official to testify in the probe, provided closed-door testimony that concerns were so fraught over blocking security assistance to Ukraine that two officials resigned.

“Two officials at [OMB] recently resigned while voicing concerns over the holdup on Ukraine aid, a career employee of the agency told impeachment investigators, according to a transcript of his testimony released Tuesday,” our colleague Erica Werner reports.

Nevertheless, public opinion over whether Trump should be impeached remains the same as in October, despite Schiff's public hearings:

CNN: “Half of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 43% say he should not,” per CNN's Jennifer Agiesta. “Neither figure has changed since October, with support for impeachment remaining at its highest level thus far in CNN polling. The partisan divide over the president persists as well, with roughly 80 points between Democratic support for Trump's removal and Republican support for it.""

HuffPost/YouGov: “Days of televised impeachment hearings have left Americans largely dug into their original opinions, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, dashing Democrats’ hopes that the testimony might finally splinter the president’s base of support and Republicans’ predictions that the hearings would backfire on their opponents,” per HuffPost's Ariel Edwards Levy. “Republicans largely dismissed that testimony as meaningless, while Democrats heralded it as a bombshell ― a split that mirrors broader public opinion.”

This compares to a 38 — 58 percent approval rating in an October 23 poll, and falls within the range of where his job approval rating has been over about the last two years.”

The numbers still don't look good for Trump, but they definitely haven't gotten worse,” Quinnipiac analyst Tim Malloy added.

Democrats definitely don't want him at dinner: Meanwhile, colleague Josh Dawsey and I scooped on a familiar face Trump turned to last week to seek advice on impeachment: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s former top strategists.

""Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said,"" we report.

WAYBACK WEDNESDAY: The trash panda that almost became a Thanksgiving turkey. ""A Mississippi resident sent a raccoon in a top-slatted soap box to the White House in November of 1926. The idea was that the animal would be slaughtered and prepared for a Thanksgiving feast, according to news reports. But President Calvin Coolidge didn’t care for raccoon meat. Turkey would suit,"" Eliza McGraw writes for The Post.

""This was, as first lady Grace Coolidge later wrote, “no ordinary raccoon."": ""The animal was lively and seemingly tame. So instead of eating her, the Coolidges, who adored animals, kept the raccoon as a pet,"" Eliza writes. ""They named her Rebecca, and when she was indoors, she roamed the White House apartments. She liked to sit in a bathtub and play with a bar of soap.""

Rebecca's adventures were just beginning: She ""became fodder for national conversations, if not a holiday meal. The Saturday after Thanksgiving, a cartoon in the Washington Evening Star showed a walrus-mustached man, broad-brimmed hat in hand, offering Coolidge a raccoon labeled, 'Low Tariff.' Coolidge, a proponent of high tariffs, holds his hand up in a 'halt!' gesture, saying, 'No thanks, I can’t swallow that whole.'""

Her later escapades included: Summering in the Black Hills, as humorist Will Rogers quipped, when Rebecca climbed a tree overlooking Custer Park natural zoo and refused to come down. Majority Whip John Q. Tilson and Wyoming Rep. Charles E. Winter were among those who tried to coax her down to no avail.

The candidate debates provided the setting for the arguments to play out before a larger audience. Warren and Sanders came under attack from moderate Democrats at the first debate in June in Miami, with former Maryland congressman John Delaney the most vocal. But Warren and Sanders more than held their own. The progressive wing appeared to be on solid ground.

Subsequent debates, however, have produced a different impression. The progressives have been much more on the defensive and the moderates more assertive. Biden tangled with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) in the Detroit debate over the issue of health care. Harris subsequently modified her position, moving toward the center. On the issue of Medicare-for-all, the ground has shifted.

During the Atlanta debate in late November, even Sanders seemed to be tempering his overall message. Asked about comments by former president Barack Obama, who had earlier told some wealthy Democratic donors that the country wasn’t looking for a revolution, Sanders replied, “He’s right. We don’t have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want.”

Judged by the current polling in the four early states, the more-moderate candidates are prospering. To the surprise of many, Buttigieg is at the top of the field in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. No one would have predicted that last spring.

Biden trails Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren in those two states, which is hardly a comfortable place to be for someone who was the acknowledged leader in the race when he announced his candidacy and who continues to lead in national polling. But he is ahead in Nevada and he has a big lead in South Carolina, where strong support from African American voters gives him what he hopes will be a firewall in the event that he is swamped in Iowa and New Hampshire.

The possibility that the four early states could be won by three or even four different candidates is one big reason that Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, sees an opening for a campaign that skips those four and starts in the states that comprise Super Tuesday in early March.

Is it a coincidence that the more-moderate candidates are doing well in those four early states at a time when Obama was sounding his words of caution? Perhaps. But Obama’s warnings about going too far to the left provided some context to the race from the perspective of someone who happens to be the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win more than 50 percent of the national vote in both of his elections.

What continues to define the Democratic race is the absence of a candidate who has truly captured the imagination of voters. Buttigieg may have come closest, at least among the voters in predominantly white Iowa and New Hampshire. His talent and intellect have certainly generated enthusiasm, marked by sizable crowds as he has campaigned in those states. But he still faces big questions about whether he can expand his appeal, particularly in the African American community.

Sanders has changed hardly a word from his stump speeches of the 2016 campaign, but in response to criticism, he has been trying to show a more-personal side. He has loyal supporters — and truly loyal contributors — but he hasn’t truly sparked the grass-roots movement he talks about. With many more candidates to choose from, some of his supporters from the last campaign have gone elsewhere.

Warren entered with sizable name recognition but saw her campaign questioned early in the year as she struggled to gain support. Then she became the star of the field during the late summer and early fall, the candidate with detailed plans and a well-regarded field organization in the states. That was at a time when Harris was falling back and Klobuchar and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) were still in single digits.

Then Warren hit turbulence over health care and fears that her advocacy for a government-run system would make it difficult for her to win a general election on that platform. That’s where she is today. She overcame doubts at the beginning of the year and will have to do it again at the end of the year.

Biden has been Biden. He can be underwhelming at times, steady at others. But he still lacks the kind of message that Obama, no doubt, would want to see in a challenger to President Trump. The attributes that have kept him generally atop the national polls are that he is familiar, experienced, well liked in the party and still seen by many Democrats as the candidate with the best chance of winning in 2020. Despite that, he gets little praise from the commentator class on cable television.

Biden’s advisers would say he is closer on issues to the Democratic primary electorate than he’s given credit for and that his appeal to African Americans (particularly older black voters) and to white working-class voters makes him well positioned for a run against Trump. But talk to party strategists in a state like Iowa and the first thing they say about Biden is that he’s generated little enthusiasm as a candidate.

Two months of campaigning remain before the first votes are cast on Feb. 3 in Iowa. In December, impeachment proceedings in the House will overshadow what the candidates do and say; then the holidays will offer voters a possible timeout from everything political.

In January, an impeachment trial in the Senate could tie up the senators in the race — Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, Harris, Booker and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) — but notably not Biden or Buttigieg. Whether that gives the non-senators an edge in the weeks when many voters will be making their decisions is the question.

More than in some past campaigns, Democratic voters appear torn between heart and head. Many are looking for a candidate who will inspire them while also being somewhat risk-averse. Those conflicting impulses could be one reason the race seems to shift and shift again and why the answer to the question of what and whom it will take to beat Trump still lies at the center of it all.

The candidate debates provided the setting for the arguments to play out before a larger audience. Warren and Sanders came under attack from moderate Democrats at the first debate in June in Miami, with former Maryland congressman John Delaney the most vocal. But Warren and Sanders more than held their own. The progressive wing appeared to be on solid ground.

Subsequent debates, however, have produced a different impression. The progressives have been much more on the defensive and the moderates more assertive. Biden tangled with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) in the Detroit debate over the issue of health care. Harris subsequently modified her position, moving toward the center. On the issue of Medicare-for-all, the ground has shifted.

During the Atlanta debate in late November, even Sanders seemed to be tempering his overall message. Asked about comments by former president Barack Obama, who had earlier told some wealthy Democratic donors that the country wasn’t looking for a revolution, Sanders replied, “He’s right. We don’t have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want.”

Warren had pleased many on the left with proposals to take on entrenched corporate and political power. But she was being warned that support for Medicare-for-all, including the elimination of private health insurance used by more than 150 million Americans, could cost her support among Democrats looking for the strongest candidate to take on President Trump.

“As [Medicare-for-all] got more attention, more and more people began to say, ‘Yeah, that’s a mistake [that] she showed flexibility,’ ” said former congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts. “But I guess she felt she couldn’t make herself totally vulnerable to the Sanders people by abandoning [Medicare-for-all] altogether.”

“It would have been better to do it earlier,” Frank said of her shift, adding that he had privately told her that backing the Sanders plan was “a terrible mistake.”

Recent polling suggests Warren has sustained political damage from her health-care policy. After climbing to the top of the field by focusing on a message of overhauling Washington and Wall Street, Warren plateaued as her campaign became consumed with health care.

Now, she is falling.

Nationally, Warren has dropped from a high of about 27 percent in October’s RealClearPolitics’ average of polls to near 16 percent at the end of November. In Iowa, she has dropped about five points in that same period, and in New Hampshire, her support has been cut in half, according to the calculation. Warren’s decline has coincided with the rise of a new entrant into the top tier: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has backed a more moderate health-care agenda and accused Warren of failing to make clear how she would pay for her plan.

This account of Warren’s health-care policy struggles — and the political repercussions that have rapidly shifted the dynamics of the 2020 Democratic race — is based on interviews with 27 advisers, experts and others familiar with the campaign’s deliberations on the issue, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.

The irony is that a candidate whose political identity has been built in part on her reputation as a policy wonk — a potential president who boasts of having a plan for nearly every challenge facing everyday Americans — has been tripped up by a policy issue that has dominated politics and defined her party for years.

In some ways, the health-care debate was uniquely suited to entangle Warren, who as a senator had never made the issue a central element of her worldview.

AD

She embraced a single-payer system as she planned her presidential run, signing onto Sanders’s Medicare-for-all bill in 2017. But Warren wanted — and felt duty-bound by her brand — to offer detailed plans to explain how it would work. Then the landscape shifted, as health-care industry groups aired ads attacking her plan and some top-tier rivals said she was refusing to acknowledge what Sanders had conceded: that middle-class taxes would rise to pay for it.

The result for Warren is a muddle, with some liberal activists feeling betrayed and little evidence emerging that she has neutralized criticism from the middle.

“As Warren’s health-care plan has been fleshed out, it does very much straddle the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic Party right now,” said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “As is often the case when you’re trying to straddle, you don’t satisfy either side.”

Warren’s team says that she has strongly supported Medicare-for-all since she signed on to Sanders’s bill. She has repeatedly told reporters that she has been working for “months and months” to develop a way to pay for it that doesn’t include higher taxes on the middle class, which some economists say she has achieved.

Several academics noted that they’d been in touch with Warren’s campaign since early in her candidacy about key details. “I’ve been very impressed by the intellectual discipline,” said Donald Berwick, a former Obama administration health-care official who often emailed with the campaign about her proposal.

“I’ve always seen a very pragmatic side to the way she thinks about health policy,” added Ezekiel Emanuel, another top health-care expert who has offered advice to Warren in her roles as senator and presidential candidate. “I think that’s been my major understanding of who she is as a person and how she thinks about things. . . . That’s the way I heard the recognition of the revised timeline.”

Some of Warren’s allies are privately frustrated by what they see as the gaps that Sanders left unfilled in his health-care plan and his willingness to “self-immolate,” as one person said, his chances in a general election by supporting a hike to middle-class taxes to pay for it.

So far, Warren’s pivot on her approach to Medicare-for-all hasn’t fully reassured some leading Democrats who are drawn to her but not yet sold.

“She would have sealed the deal if she said, ‘Make no mistake, I think Medicare-for-all is the right thing and I’m going to create a structure to study it and finance it. But in the meantime, I’m going to provide a guide path,’ ” said one top New Hampshire Democrat.

AD

Meanwhile, the pivot to calling for a transition phase opens questions about what Warren believes. “It looks defensive,” this person said.

AD

The origins of Warren’s health-care conundrum can be traced to her earliest days in politics.

She didn’t support single-payer health care in her 2012 Senate run. And as a new senator,Warren was never seen as an ally in the fight for government-run health care, even by the liberal groups who otherwise supported her.

“It’s this weird relationship where everyone really respects her, but it didn’t feel like we had someone out in front as a health-care justice warrior,” said Ture Turnbull, who served as executive director of MassCare, a Massachusetts health-care advocacy group. Turnbull added that Warren seemed mostly focused on protecting the Affordable Care Act.

AD

Though she had signed onto Sanders’s bill, Warren rarely mentioned the program on the stump in the opening weeks of her presidential campaign this year.

AD

She appeared to keep her distance in high-profile interviews, telling Bloomberg TV in January that there are “multiple bills” that ensure affordable health care for every American. In March, she said in a CNN town hall that there are different “pathways” to a government-run health plan and said there “could” be a role for private health insurance coverage.

Some activists interpreted her remarks as wishy-washy, putting her out of step with the left wing of the party that she was courting.

“The stuff that came out in the spring, we communicated to [Warren’s campaign] staff that we were uncomfortable with the equivocation,” said Stephanie Woolhandler, who has counseled Warren on health policy for several years and is also the co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program, a single-payer advocacy group. “We advised against equivocating and taking halfway steps.”

The concerns reverberated in Warren’s Boston campaign headquarters, where preparations were underway for the first formal debate of the 2020 campaign cycle set for June in Miami. “The Warren campaign was deeply anxious about Bernie in the weeks before the first Democratic debate,” said someone who talks frequently with Warren’s campaign and was granted anonymity to speak candidly about its thinking at the time.

Among liberals, those fears lifted when, during the debate, Warren’s hand shot into the air in response to a question about who onstage would get rid of the private health insurance industry. “So, yes, I’m with Bernie on Medicare-for-all,” she said.

Rather than settling the matter, new questions emerged.

Warren’s competitors were moving away from the plan. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who endured sharp criticism for an earlier answer in which she seemed to support eliminating private insurance, released her own health-care plan in July that allowed a 10-year transition to Medicare-for-all. “I listened to American families who said, “I want an option,’ ” Harris explained days after she made the change.

Buttigieg began rising in the polls. Though he’d tweeted that he was in “favor” of Medicare-for-all in early 2018, during the presidential campaign he repeatedly talked about “Medicare for all who want it” and released a plan in September that would open Medicare to many Americans as a public option but allow private insurance to continue.

By the end of September, Buttigieg was running TV ads in Iowa that contrasted his approach with unnamed rivals who back Medicare-for-all. “Others say, ‘It is Medicare-for-all or nothing,’ ” Buttigieg says in the 30-second spot. “The choice should be yours.”

The industry piled on. The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a coalition of hospitals and insurance companies, launched a $1 million TV ad campaign against Medicare-for-all and other changes to health care. Forty percent of it was dumped into Iowa media markets, ground zero for the Democratic campaign, according to data from Advertising Analytics. One spot claimed that “unaffordable proposals” to change health care “could double everyone’s income taxes.” Another claimed that overhaul plans would mean “higher taxes or higher premiums.”

Another group led by Republican strategist Steven Law has spent $5.9 million on TV ads opposing Medicare-for-all, including roughly $650,000 in Iowa, Law said. The ads made a case that wait times for doctor visits would lengthen, a message that caused particular angst for women, Law said.

On the ground in the early states, Warren heard skeptical questions about Medicare-for-all in her public town hall meetings and during private meetings that her staff frequently arranges with key community leaders before she goes onstage. The exchanges were a reminder that many in Warren’s base of largely educated affluent voters might not be ready to give up their private health plans.

“The fact of the matter is, the people who are going to be more likely to show up at her events are going to be people who already have pretty good health insurance,” said Rod Sullivan, a member of the Board of Supervisors in Johnson County, Iowa, who has endorsed Warren. “So when other candidates sow the seeds of doubt with them and say, ‘She’s going to kick you off this. What if it’s worse than what you have?’ Those people are nervous.”

Sullivan recalls standing by Warren in mid-September as she mingled with about 50 people hand selected for a private chat with her ahead of a rally. As these local Democrats came up to talk with her, he said, health care was a constant topic.

“People were saying, ‘Well, I’m concerned about this or that.’ And Warren was reminding people that what you have now is bankrupting you,” he said.

The pressure came to a boiling point when candidates met in Ohio in mid-October for a marathon three-hour debate. It was the first one in which Warren had taken the lead in several surveys — and her rivals came prepared to go after what they saw as a glaring vulnerability. They zeroed in on Warren’s repeated refusal to say whether middle-class taxes would go up.

“Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except for this,” Buttigieg said.

“At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of several more moderate contenders. “And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Seven days after the debate, Warren told an audience in Indianola, Iowa, that she would soon release a plan to pay for her Medicare-for-all proposal.

Behind the scenes, Warren’s staff worked frantically to come up with answers, with staffers reaching out repeatedly to academics to test various ideas.

On Nov. 1, Warren released a $20.5 trillion plan that would rely mostly on tax increases on the rich and on companies, her campaign said, adding that it would avoid any tax hikes for the middle class.

Once again, Warren seemed to succeed only in further complicating her political predicament.

While she was trying to reassure the left of her loyalty to the Medicare-for-all cause, she was also promising to carry the fight to the general election by introducing a massive tax on the rich and companies, adding levies that economists argued would be passed on to workers. She was effectively daring Trump, who has expressed eagerness to portray the Democrats as socialists, to paint her as a tax-and-spend liberal who would take away health insurance from millions in her first term.

Centrists pounced.

Former vice president Joe Biden said Warren’s cost estimates were off by trillions. “She’s making it up. There is no way,” Biden said in an interview with “PBS NewsHour.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who credits a more moderate stance on health care focused on protecting the Affordable Care Act with helping the Democrats take the House in 2018, used a TV interview that day to warn of potential danger ahead for her party — though she did not mention Warren by name.

“I’m not a big fan of Medicare-for-all,” Pelosi told Bloomberg TV, adding: “Hopefully, as we emerge into the election year, the mantra will be, ‘More health care for all Americans.’ Because there is a comfort level that some people have with their current private insurance.”

Two weeks later, on Nov. 15, Warren offered yet another health-care announcement: the “transition plan” that would include an intermediate step letting Americans participate in an optional government-run health plan before an attempt to pass a mandatory program is made.

“By the end of my first 100 days, we will have opened the door for tens of millions of Americans to get high-quality Medicare for All coverage at little or no cost,” Warren wrote in a Medium post. “But I won’t stop there. Throughout my term, I’ll fight for additional health system reforms.”

Warren added, “No later than my third year in office, I will fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All.”

It was seen by many on the left as a clear concession.

“You should use the political momentum you have to pass a single plan and use the years in between defending and broadening support for it,” said Mark Dudzic, national coordinator of the Labor Campaign for Single Payer Healthcare, which urges unions to support Medicare-for-all. Dudzic added that he still considers Warren a supporter of Medicare-for-all.

To answer lingering questions about her position, Warren has begun dispatching a policy adviser to Iowa to present the details of her program in small sessions.

The campaign has also worked to line up supporters — which wasn’t always an easy sell.

A key person in validating Warren’s plan has been Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of the Medicare-for-all legislation, who praised it despite the objections of some members of her staff, according to two people familiar with the discussions.

The congressional staffers have expressed reservations that Warren’s plan would not push for a single-payer system until the third year of her administration, according to these people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly of the staffers’ private views about internal talks. Jayapal’s spokesman denied that claim.

Warren’s campaign has tried to describe the three-year delay in pushing for Medicare-for-all as a minor adjustment. At the same time, Warren goes to great lengths to offer reassurance to people that she’s heard their concerns about her earlier position.

At a small town hall in Ankeny, Iowa, on Monday afternoon, Bailey Caskey, a student at the University of Northern Iowa who has committed to caucus for Warren, asked how she could convince her mother on the merits of Medicare-for-all.

For about six minutes, Warren explained — in more detail than usual — how she planned to transition to the system.

“My basic notion has been, we try to get as much help as we can to as many people as we can as fast as we can,” Warren said."
