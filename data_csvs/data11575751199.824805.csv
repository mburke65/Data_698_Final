Goldman met Representative Adam B. Schiff in a classic Washington way: They struck up a conversation in the green room at MSNBC.

The men, both Democrats, had plenty to talk about. Both former federal prosecutors, Mr. Schiff had a deep interest in Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, while Mr. Goldman had investigated Russian organized crime. He told Mr. Schiff to call him if he could be of use. When Democrats won the House and Mr. Schiff became chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he did, inviting Mr. Goldman to join his staff as the chief investigator.

Now Mr. Goldman is the lead author of a report, a draft of which committee members were able to review in private starting Monday evening, that forms the backbone of Democrats’ case for impeaching Mr. Trump. He is one of two unelected officials — the other is Stephen R. Castor, his Republican counterpart, who compiled the dissenting views — who have taken a crucial and unusually public job in the debate over the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and the nation.

The pair achieved a measure of Washington stardom over two weeks last month as they grilled witnesses during nationally televised public hearings. The House Judiciary Committee this week begins public hearings to consider articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, meaning Mr. Goldman will probably take the spotlight again to present the Democrats’ case that the president abused his power by trying to enlist Ukraine to dig up damaging information on his political rivals, and it will fall to Mr. Castor to counter it."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. archived recording (elise stefanik) What is the interruption for this time? It is our time — archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you are minority counsel — archived recording (devin nunes) I just recognized — archived recording (adam schiff) Under the House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel. archived recording (elise stefanik) The ranking member yielded time to another member of Congress. archived recording (adam schiff) No.

julie hirschfeld davis

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

archived recording (devin nunes) You’re gagging the young lady from New York? archived recording (elise stefanik) That is accurate. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) Gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

julie hirschfeld davis

— accusing the president of having abused his power.

archived recording (eric swalwell) Can we also agree that it’s just wrong? archived recording (william taylor) Yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

And narratives from people who were there at key moments.

archived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?

julie hirschfeld davis

Hearing his phone call with the president of Ukraine.

archived recording (alexander vindman) I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report.

julie hirschfeld davis

Saying in front of a committee room that “everyone was in the loop.”

archived recording (gordon sondland) Everyone was in the loop.

julie hirschfeld davis

This came directly from the president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) At the express direction of the president of the United States.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. may lose the Iowa caucuses. But he is betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas to help him accrue the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.

It might work. That’s because an overwhelming majority of delegates are awarded from areas more racially diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests.

Think of it this way: Candidates gain delegates based on voting in both states and districts, which are Congressional districts in all but a few places. While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates.

A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters.

Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, Ala., who has yet to endorse a candidate, said national political analysts are underestimating the political advantages Mr. Biden enjoys in the South.

“It’s not that he’s weaker than people think,” Mr. Woodfin said. “He’s much stronger.”

In most states, districts are Congressional districts, but can be other boundaries. Texas, included in the graphic, uses state legislature districts. North Carolina districts may change, pending redistricting.

As the chart above shows, some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.)

Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates.

This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.

The last Democratic candidate to win the nomination without winning a majority of black voters was Michael Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts, in 1988; Rev. Jesse Jackson secured more of their support. In 2004, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts won the nomination with a slight majority of black votes, after battling with Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.

Cornell Belcher, the pollster who helped conduct much of Mr. Obama's South Carolina research, compared Mr. Biden’s support in black communities in the 2020 primary to the advantages Mrs. Clinton experienced early in 2008. However, he said, none of Mr. Biden’s rivals are replicating Mr. Obama’s robust black grass-roots program.

“If they were replicating what we did in 2007, they would already have the resources and infrastructure on the ground in South Carolina like we did,” he said. “If they were replicating what we did in ‘07, there would already be a Harris or Buttigieg barber shop and hair salon program in place on the grass-roots level that went under and around the black establishment in the state.”

The delegate calendar for the Democratic Party also shows the limitations of viewing the race through the prisms of the early states.

The vast majority of delegates awarded early in the race come on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 15 states and territories will hold their primaries and caucuses. More than 1,300 pledged delegates are awarded that day.

By the end of Super Tuesday, 38 percent of all the pledged delegates in 19 states and territories will have been allocated, making it difficult for candidates to build a voter coalition if they are not competitive by that point.

The candidates best positioned to overtake Mr. Biden’s voter coalition at this point — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — each face challenges in attracting a diverse range of voters, albeit to varying degrees.

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have shown some traction with younger, nonwhite voters. Mr. Sanders in particular has polled better among nonwhite voters than any candidate other than Mr. Biden, though he remains a distant second. He is also betting on an electoral strategy that will encourage those who sat out the 2016 primary to join the process, which supporters believe will help him grow his diverse coalition.

There are signs in California, the primary’s most delegate-rich state, that Ms. Warren can challenge Mr. Biden on more diverse territory. Ms. Warren has led some polls in the state, and her team says that a good showing in the early states can unlock more support, citing the backing of diverse progressive groups like the Working Families Party.

Mr. Buttigieg is a unique case. While he has shown significant momentum in Iowa, that support has yet to translate outside the first state. Unlike Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders he has been anemic with black voters — polling again at 0 percent in the latest South Carolina survey — and several high-profile errors have helped create a reputation that his campaign has a blindspot for nonwhite constituencies.

Without a reversal, Mr. Buttigieg risks joining a dubious list: Candidates who succeeded in Iowa and New Hampshire but nonetheless lost the Democratic nomination.

Most eventual Democratic nominees won Iowa or New Hampshire Year Eventual nominee Iowa New Hampshire 1972 George McGovern 1976 Jimmy Carter 1980 Jimmy Carter 1984 Walter Mondale 1988 Michael Dukakis 1992 Bill Clinton 2000 Al Gore 2004 John Kerry 2008 Barack Obama 2016 Hillary Clinton Sources: Des Moines Register, New York Times | Note: Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012 are excluded because they were incumbents with no significant challengers.

Some candidates who are struggling to break through Mr. Biden’s advantage with black voters have compared their plight to Mr. Obama’s; he won Iowa in 2008 and built a national coalition after. However, Mr. Belcher said that comparison should be scrutinized, considering Mr. Obama was much better positioned across the country than many of the candidates who likened themselves to him.

Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris of California, among others, are now banking on a breakthrough in Iowa to help propel them forward in the early states and compete with Mr. Biden among black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday. Ms. Harris, for one, has been making direct appeals to black voters in the South.

“When we talk about black girl magic, we know that it is something special,” Ms. Harris told a crowd at Benedict College, a historically black institution in Columbia, S.C. “But that magic is born out of hard work.”

Mr. Belcher acknowledged that few 2020 candidates have the resources that were available to Mr. Obama in 2007, but he also said the campaigns have been guilty of “lazy thinking,” if they planned to wrest Mr. Biden’s black support simply by winning an early state.

“They are taking a key constituency that they need for granted,” he said."

Here’s His Strategy.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/joe-biden-campaign-iowa.html,"This is the U.S. secretary of war in 1908, William Taft. One day, he decides that he wants a formal portrait of himself. The photographer arrives, but then the phone rings. He starts taking pictures anyway. On the phone is Taft’s friend Theodore Roosevelt, the president. It’s a long conversation, but suddenly, the photographer lucks out. Taft learns that Roosevelt’s chosen him to run for president as his successor. It’s a good choice. Taft goes on to the campaign trail and wins. It’s an historic win because, even though he’s the 27th president, he’s only the first president to win after running a big nationwide campaign tour. Before him, presidential candidates were expected to stay quiet, sit at home. Several decades later — [Music playing] So how did we get here, from a time when personally campaigning for president was unheard of to — We’ll start in 1789. George Washington becomes America’s first president. The founders are hell-bent on making sure a president can’t accumulate too much power. Remember, they just kicked out a king. They don’t want another one of those. They want a president to be humble, like the George Washington depicted here as a simple farmer. If a candidate goes directly to the public, campaigns for themself and asks for votes, it could be a warning sign. They may be power-hungry, a wannabe English king in waiting. “The office must seek the man, not the man the office,” one historian explained. Basically, today’s campaigning would seem very sketchy indeed. Anyway, Washington sets the tone. He’s careful not to appear at all like he wants the presidency. He’s there out of duty. Washington’s example will loom large over presidential candidates for the next century, even as the country quickly changes. This is a political cartoon from 1852. That’s a presidential candidate. That’s a political party boss. And that’s the candidate’s mouth, kept shut. As the country grows, political parties also grow. They choose who the candidates will be and they do all the campaigning on the candidate’s behalf. The candidates, well, they’re expected to stay reserved, Washington-like, mouth shut. But occasionally, candidates campaign anyway. And they’re the ones who slowly chip away at tradition. Let’s go to 1860 for one glaring example. Abraham Lincoln is running against three others for the presidency. One of them decides to throw precedence out the window. Stephen Douglas, a man who’s in danger of losing, decides to go on a big campaign tour. But because of tradition, he can’t just come out and say what he’s doing. So Douglas makes excuses. He says the tour is in order to see his mother in upstate New York, visit his childhood home in Vermont, and watch his brother-in-law graduate from Harvard. Along the way, he makes campaign speeches, and gets heaps of criticism for doing so. The New York Times writes that the presidency is “too high to be reached by a mere stump speaker, and too dignified to be canvassed for like a county clerkship or a seat in Congress.” Douglas, of course, loses, but the size of his stumping tour is another step towards public campaigning. Things will loosen up a bit more, quite by accident, on a front porch in Ohio two decades later. Meanwhile, the political parties have gotten so big and so corrupt there’s a backlash against them. Americans want to interact more with the candidates directly, without the party machines getting in the way. Enter Republican nominee James Garfield. He’s planned to spend the election of 1880 laying low at his home in Ohio, just as candidates usually do. But then, people keep showing up at his house. They want to see their candidate in person. Garfield’s got to say something. He can’t just ignore them. So he gives a bunch of short speeches from his front porch. Garfield has stumbled on a way to personally campaign without risking criticism by going on some big campaign tour. He just does it from home and says it’s because people just showed up. He wins. But this doesn’t turn the tide entirely. 16 years later, however, there’s an upset at the Democratic National Convention. An obscure Nebraska congressman is nominated for president, William Jennings Bryan. He’s so polarizing that many in his party won’t campaign for him. That means Bryan has to do it himself, which is fine, because his whole persona is being a voice for the common people against powerful institutions. It makes sense that he’d ignore political traditions and instead speak to voters himself. He covers 27 states. His opponent, William McKinley, on the other hand, doesn’t hit the road. He takes a page from Garfield’s book, and give speeches from his own front porch. “My fellow citizens —” But it’s all much grander this time. There are parades out front. 750,000 people come to visit. Both strategies are extreme for the time, but McKinley’s is safer. One way to look at what’s going on here is with this pro-McKinley cartoon. It plays up their age difference. McKinley served in the Civil War when Bryan was still a baby. Bryan is now 36, part of a whole new generation. He’s less connected to the colonial traditions that kept candidates at a distance from the public. McKinley ends up winning anyway, but when they have a rematch for president four years later, McKinley doesn’t actively campaign for re-election because now McKinley is a president. And damn the winds of change, remember, the presidency is too sacred an office to use for campaigning. Enter the man so consumed with the limelight that his daughter once said he wanted to be “the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.” Teddy Roosevelt, McKinley’s running mate. No one said vice presidential candidates can’t stump. As Bryan and Roosevelt go at it in 1900, we see two young, brash candidates drawing crowds with their charisma. Or as historian Gil Troy puts it, they “helped bury a century-old tradition of candidate passivity.” And then four years later, the man who loves a crowd, now President Teddy Roosevelt, falls silent when it’s time to run for his re-election. Presidents still mustn’t campaign. Now is when we come to William Taft, whose big smile we saw at the beginning. And I want to use this image to explain what happens during the election of 1908. On the right is a Taft mannequin. On the left is a William Jennings Bryan mannequin. He’s running again, for a third time. Let’s look closer. There’s a phonograph playing pre-recorded speeches by the candidates. Signs encourage voters to also hear the candidates’ rebuttals to each other. It’s even assumed that voters will pay money to hear all this. That’s how far American norms have shifted in the new century. They expect a more direct democracy with accessible candidates. Now the funny thing about this is, is that Taft is totally against this idea at first. He’s more keen on staying old-school and holding a front porch campaign. No one really shows up. But with Bryan on the road getting all the attention and Taft’s allies pushing him to do the same, he doesn’t have a choice. This is how it works now. He hits the campaign trail, literally following in the footsteps of Bryan. It goes great. He wins. Historian Richard Ellis notes that Taft “helped erase the association between stumping and losing.” Like I said at the beginning, the first president to be elected after making a full campaign tour. It’s not like there’s something about Taft that makes him the first president to stump mightily and win. It’s the combination of incremental changes in American society and behaviors by earlier candidates. If we zip ahead to 1944, we can look back and see just how far things have come. It’s Franklin Roosevelt’s last campaign. At one point, he gets driven 50 miles through the streets of New York City, in an open car, in winter. “And a great welcome from all the boroughs.” An incumbent president pleading his case to the public for a fourth term. The campaigns, the rallies, they all just become part of seeking the presidency. So when you watch presidential candidates on the campaign trail, sitting in diners, riding in buses, shaking hands and taking selfies, and crowd surfing, it’s not quite what the founders intended, but it’s what the people demanded. [Cheering] So five minutes into the video, we talked about President McKinley’s famous front porch campaign. Turns out McKinley is famous for another type of public appearance. His two inaugurations were the first to ever be recorded by a moving picture camera. If you look closely, you can see the chief justice of the Supreme Court raising his hand to give the oath of office. Consequently, McKinley’s was the first presidential funeral to also be filmed. He was assassinated during his second term."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. archived recording (elise stefanik) What is the interruption for this time? It is our time — archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you are minority counsel — archived recording (devin nunes) I just recognized — archived recording (adam schiff) Under the House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel. archived recording (elise stefanik) The ranking member yielded time to another member of Congress. archived recording (adam schiff) No.

julie hirschfeld davis

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

archived recording (devin nunes) You’re gagging the young lady from New York? archived recording (elise stefanik) That is accurate. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) Gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

julie hirschfeld davis

— accusing the president of having abused his power.

archived recording (eric swalwell) Can we also agree that it’s just wrong? archived recording (william taylor) Yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

And narratives from people who were there at key moments.

archived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?

julie hirschfeld davis

Hearing his phone call with the president of Ukraine.

archived recording (alexander vindman) I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report.

julie hirschfeld davis

Saying in front of a committee room that “everyone was in the loop.”

archived recording (gordon sondland) Everyone was in the loop.

julie hirschfeld davis

This came directly from the president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) At the express direction of the president of the United States.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Goldman met Representative Adam B. Schiff in a classic Washington way: They struck up a conversation in the green room at MSNBC.

The men, both Democrats, had plenty to talk about. Both former federal prosecutors, Mr. Schiff had a deep interest in Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, while Mr. Goldman had investigated Russian organized crime. He told Mr. Schiff to call him if he could be of use. When Democrats won the House and Mr. Schiff became chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he did, inviting Mr. Goldman to join his staff as the chief investigator.

Now Mr. Goldman is the lead author of a report, a draft of which committee members were able to review in private starting Monday evening, that forms the backbone of Democrats’ case for impeaching Mr. Trump. He is one of two unelected officials — the other is Stephen R. Castor, his Republican counterpart, who compiled the dissenting views — who have taken a crucial and unusually public job in the debate over the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and the nation.

The pair achieved a measure of Washington stardom over two weeks last month as they grilled witnesses during nationally televised public hearings. The House Judiciary Committee this week begins public hearings to consider articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, meaning Mr. Goldman will probably take the spotlight again to present the Democrats’ case that the president abused his power by trying to enlist Ukraine to dig up damaging information on his political rivals, and it will fall to Mr. Castor to counter it."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

— accusing the president of having abused his power.

archived recording (eric swalwell) Can we also agree that it’s just wrong? archived recording (william taylor) Yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

And narratives from people who were there at key moments.

archived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?

julie hirschfeld davis

Hearing his phone call with the president of Ukraine.

archived recording (alexander vindman) I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report.

julie hirschfeld davis

Saying in front of a committee room that “everyone was in the loop.”

archived recording (gordon sondland) Everyone was in the loop.

julie hirschfeld davis

This came directly from the president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) At the express direction of the president of the United States.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. may lose the Iowa caucuses. But he is betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas to help him accrue the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.

It might work. That’s because an overwhelming majority of delegates are awarded from areas more racially diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests.

Think of it this way: Candidates gain delegates based on voting in both states and districts, which are Congressional districts in all but a few places. While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates.

A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters.

Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, Ala., who has yet to endorse a candidate, said national political analysts are underestimating the political advantages Mr. Biden enjoys in the South.

“It’s not that he’s weaker than people think,” Mr. Woodfin said. “He’s much stronger.”

In most states, districts are Congressional districts, but can be other boundaries. Texas, included in the graphic, uses state legislature districts. North Carolina districts may change, pending redistricting.

As the chart above shows, some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.)

Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates.

This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.

The last Democratic candidate to win the nomination without winning a majority of black voters was Michael Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts, in 1988; Rev. Jesse Jackson secured more of their support. In 2004, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts won the nomination with a slight majority of black votes, after battling with Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.

Cornell Belcher, the pollster who helped conduct much of Mr. Obama's South Carolina research, compared Mr. Biden’s support in black communities in the 2020 primary to the advantages Mrs. Clinton experienced early in 2008. However, he said, none of Mr. Biden’s rivals are replicating Mr. Obama’s robust black grass-roots program.

“If they were replicating what we did in 2007, they would already have the resources and infrastructure on the ground in South Carolina like we did,” he said. “If they were replicating what we did in ‘07, there would already be a Harris or Buttigieg barber shop and hair salon program in place on the grass-roots level that went under and around the black establishment in the state.”

The delegate calendar for the Democratic Party also shows the limitations of viewing the race through the prisms of the early states.

The vast majority of delegates awarded early in the race come on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 15 states and territories will hold their primaries and caucuses. More than 1,300 pledged delegates are awarded that day.

By the end of Super Tuesday, 38 percent of all the pledged delegates in 19 states and territories will have been allocated, making it difficult for candidates to build a voter coalition if they are not competitive by that point.

The candidates best positioned to overtake Mr. Biden’s voter coalition at this point — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — each face challenges in attracting a diverse range of voters, albeit to varying degrees.

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have shown some traction with younger, nonwhite voters. Mr. Sanders in particular has polled better among nonwhite voters than any candidate other than Mr. Biden, though he remains a distant second. He is also betting on an electoral strategy that will encourage those who sat out the 2016 primary to join the process, which supporters believe will help him grow his diverse coalition.

There are signs in California, the primary’s most delegate-rich state, that Ms. Warren can challenge Mr. Biden on more diverse territory. Ms. Warren has led some polls in the state, and her team says that a good showing in the early states can unlock more support, citing the backing of diverse progressive groups like the Working Families Party.

Mr. Buttigieg is a unique case. While he has shown significant momentum in Iowa, that support has yet to translate outside the first state. Unlike Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders he has been anemic with black voters — polling again at 0 percent in the latest South Carolina survey — and several high-profile errors have helped create a reputation that his campaign has a blindspot for nonwhite constituencies.

Without a reversal, Mr. Buttigieg risks joining a dubious list: Candidates who succeeded in Iowa and New Hampshire but nonetheless lost the Democratic nomination.

Most eventual Democratic nominees won Iowa or New Hampshire Year Eventual nominee Iowa New Hampshire 1972 George McGovern 1976 Jimmy Carter 1980 Jimmy Carter 1984 Walter Mondale 1988 Michael Dukakis 1992 Bill Clinton 2000 Al Gore 2004 John Kerry 2008 Barack Obama 2016 Hillary Clinton Sources: Des Moines Register, New York Times | Note: Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012 are excluded because they were incumbents with no significant challengers.

Some candidates who are struggling to break through Mr. Biden’s advantage with black voters have compared their plight to Mr. Obama’s; he won Iowa in 2008 and built a national coalition after. However, Mr. Belcher said that comparison should be scrutinized, considering Mr. Obama was much better positioned across the country than many of the candidates who likened themselves to him.

Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris of California, among others, are now banking on a breakthrough in Iowa to help propel them forward in the early states and compete with Mr. Biden among black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday. Ms. Harris, for one, has been making direct appeals to black voters in the South.

“When we talk about black girl magic, we know that it is something special,” Ms. Harris told a crowd at Benedict College, a historically black institution in Columbia, S.C. “But that magic is born out of hard work.”

Mr. Belcher acknowledged that few 2020 candidates have the resources that were available to Mr. Obama in 2007, but he also said the campaigns have been guilty of “lazy thinking,” if they planned to wrest Mr. Biden’s black support simply by winning an early state.

“They are taking a key constituency that they need for granted,” he said."

Here’s His Strategy.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/joe-biden-campaign-iowa.html,"This is the U.S. secretary of war in 1908, William Taft. One day, he decides that he wants a formal portrait of himself. The photographer arrives, but then the phone rings. He starts taking pictures anyway. On the phone is Taft’s friend Theodore Roosevelt, the president. It’s a long conversation, but suddenly, the photographer lucks out. Taft learns that Roosevelt’s chosen him to run for president as his successor. It’s a good choice. Taft goes on to the campaign trail and wins. It’s an historic win because, even though he’s the 27th president, he’s only the first president to win after running a big nationwide campaign tour. Before him, presidential candidates were expected to stay quiet, sit at home. Several decades later — [Music playing] So how did we get here, from a time when personally campaigning for president was unheard of to — We’ll start in 1789. George Washington becomes America’s first president. The founders are hell-bent on making sure a president can’t accumulate too much power. Remember, they just kicked out a king. They don’t want another one of those. They want a president to be humble, like the George Washington depicted here as a simple farmer. If a candidate goes directly to the public, campaigns for themself and asks for votes, it could be a warning sign. They may be power-hungry, a wannabe English king in waiting. “The office must seek the man, not the man the office,” one historian explained. Basically, today’s campaigning would seem very sketchy indeed. Anyway, Washington sets the tone. He’s careful not to appear at all like he wants the presidency. He’s there out of duty. Washington’s example will loom large over presidential candidates for the next century, even as the country quickly changes. This is a political cartoon from 1852. That’s a presidential candidate. That’s a political party boss. And that’s the candidate’s mouth, kept shut. As the country grows, political parties also grow. They choose who the candidates will be and they do all the campaigning on the candidate’s behalf. The candidates, well, they’re expected to stay reserved, Washington-like, mouth shut. But occasionally, candidates campaign anyway. And they’re the ones who slowly chip away at tradition. Let’s go to 1860 for one glaring example. Abraham Lincoln is running against three others for the presidency. One of them decides to throw precedence out the window. Stephen Douglas, a man who’s in danger of losing, decides to go on a big campaign tour. But because of tradition, he can’t just come out and say what he’s doing. So Douglas makes excuses. He says the tour is in order to see his mother in upstate New York, visit his childhood home in Vermont, and watch his brother-in-law graduate from Harvard. Along the way, he makes campaign speeches, and gets heaps of criticism for doing so. The New York Times writes that the presidency is “too high to be reached by a mere stump speaker, and too dignified to be canvassed for like a county clerkship or a seat in Congress.” Douglas, of course, loses, but the size of his stumping tour is another step towards public campaigning. Things will loosen up a bit more, quite by accident, on a front porch in Ohio two decades later. Meanwhile, the political parties have gotten so big and so corrupt there’s a backlash against them. Americans want to interact more with the candidates directly, without the party machines getting in the way. Enter Republican nominee James Garfield. He’s planned to spend the election of 1880 laying low at his home in Ohio, just as candidates usually do. But then, people keep showing up at his house. They want to see their candidate in person. Garfield’s got to say something. He can’t just ignore them. So he gives a bunch of short speeches from his front porch. Garfield has stumbled on a way to personally campaign without risking criticism by going on some big campaign tour. He just does it from home and says it’s because people just showed up. He wins. But this doesn’t turn the tide entirely. 16 years later, however, there’s an upset at the Democratic National Convention. An obscure Nebraska congressman is nominated for president, William Jennings Bryan. He’s so polarizing that many in his party won’t campaign for him. That means Bryan has to do it himself, which is fine, because his whole persona is being a voice for the common people against powerful institutions. It makes sense that he’d ignore political traditions and instead speak to voters himself. He covers 27 states. His opponent, William McKinley, on the other hand, doesn’t hit the road. He takes a page from Garfield’s book, and give speeches from his own front porch. “My fellow citizens —” But it’s all much grander this time. There are parades out front. 750,000 people come to visit. Both strategies are extreme for the time, but McKinley’s is safer. One way to look at what’s going on here is with this pro-McKinley cartoon. It plays up their age difference. McKinley served in the Civil War when Bryan was still a baby. Bryan is now 36, part of a whole new generation. He’s less connected to the colonial traditions that kept candidates at a distance from the public. McKinley ends up winning anyway, but when they have a rematch for president four years later, McKinley doesn’t actively campaign for re-election because now McKinley is a president. And damn the winds of change, remember, the presidency is too sacred an office to use for campaigning. Enter the man so consumed with the limelight that his daughter once said he wanted to be “the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.” Teddy Roosevelt, McKinley’s running mate. No one said vice presidential candidates can’t stump. As Bryan and Roosevelt go at it in 1900, we see two young, brash candidates drawing crowds with their charisma. Or as historian Gil Troy puts it, they “helped bury a century-old tradition of candidate passivity.” And then four years later, the man who loves a crowd, now President Teddy Roosevelt, falls silent when it’s time to run for his re-election. Presidents still mustn’t campaign. Now is when we come to William Taft, whose big smile we saw at the beginning. And I want to use this image to explain what happens during the election of 1908. On the right is a Taft mannequin. On the left is a William Jennings Bryan mannequin. He’s running again, for a third time. Let’s look closer. There’s a phonograph playing pre-recorded speeches by the candidates. Signs encourage voters to also hear the candidates’ rebuttals to each other. It’s even assumed that voters will pay money to hear all this. That’s how far American norms have shifted in the new century. They expect a more direct democracy with accessible candidates. Now the funny thing about this is, is that Taft is totally against this idea at first. He’s more keen on staying old-school and holding a front porch campaign. No one really shows up. But with Bryan on the road getting all the attention and Taft’s allies pushing him to do the same, he doesn’t have a choice. This is how it works now. He hits the campaign trail, literally following in the footsteps of Bryan. It goes great. He wins. Historian Richard Ellis notes that Taft “helped erase the association between stumping and losing.” Like I said at the beginning, the first president to be elected after making a full campaign tour. It’s not like there’s something about Taft that makes him the first president to stump mightily and win. It’s the combination of incremental changes in American society and behaviors by earlier candidates. If we zip ahead to 1944, we can look back and see just how far things have come. It’s Franklin Roosevelt’s last campaign. At one point, he gets driven 50 miles through the streets of New York City, in an open car, in winter. “And a great welcome from all the boroughs.” An incumbent president pleading his case to the public for a fourth term. The campaigns, the rallies, they all just become part of seeking the presidency. So when you watch presidential candidates on the campaign trail, sitting in diners, riding in buses, shaking hands and taking selfies, and crowd surfing, it’s not quite what the founders intended, but it’s what the people demanded. [Cheering] So five minutes into the video, we talked about President McKinley’s famous front porch campaign. Turns out McKinley is famous for another type of public appearance. His two inaugurations were the first to ever be recorded by a moving picture camera. If you look closely, you can see the chief justice of the Supreme Court raising his hand to give the oath of office. Consequently, McKinley’s was the first presidential funeral to also be filmed. He was assassinated during his second term."

After I wrote a column a couple of months ago about the promise and disappointment of Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, one Times reader from Boston left a comment that I thought was particularly smart. “Prosecutors rarely translate well when it comes to governing at the executive level,” the reader wrote. “Their default mode is neither policy nor the long view.”

Harris came up through California politics as a prosecutor. And she never seemed to develop a clear theory of how to use government to improve people’s lives. Barack Obama, who worked as a state legislator, did develop such a theory. So did Bill Clinton, who started as a prosecutor but then spent years as a governor. So has Elizabeth Warren, who came from academia.

An especially interesting contrast this year is Pete Buttigieg, whose résumé is less impressive than Harris’s and who, in my view, isn’t as charismatic as she is. But when I listen to Buttigieg describe his vision, I understand it. His time as a mayor of a small city shaped that vision, much as it did for Bernie Sanders decades earlier. With Harris, I was never quite sure what her vision was. Her vaguely titled memoir (“The Truths We Hold”) and oddly flat campaign slogans (like “Justice Is on the Ballot”) captured the problem."

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The House Intelligence Committee has released its impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, signaling the end of one phase of impeachment and the beginning of another. Julie Davis on why those two phases will look so different. It’s Wednesday, December 4. Julie, tell me about these two phases of the House impeachment inquiry.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the House Intelligence Committee has just finished its report and completed its work, and now the House Judiciary Committee has its job to do. And these are two very different committees. The House Intelligence Committee is a very buttoned-up, frequently less partisan place. They deal in matters of intelligence. They oversee the intelligence community. They deal in state secrets, and because of that —

archived recording (mike rogers) Committee has been extensively briefed on these efforts over a regular basis as a part of our ongoing oversight responsibility.

julie hirschfeld davis

— it attracts the workhorse members who are into dealing with long reports, really meaty, substantive issues, oftentimes behind closed doors, not in front of the news cameras.

archived recording (mike rogers) Ranking member and I believe it is important to hold an open hearing today, and we don’t do a tremendous amount of those.

julie hirschfeld davis

Dilatory tactics, parliamentary stunts — that sort of thing just doesn’t happen that often in the Intelligence Committee, because that’s just not what they’re about.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.

julie hirschfeld davis

The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is kind of known for that. And the Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts and the Justice Department, but it also has jurisdiction over cultural hot button issues.

archived recording (bob goodlatte) We welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on “Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

julie hirschfeld davis

It has jurisdiction over questions of abortion rights, over gun rights —

archived recording (lucy mcbath) I ask my colleagues on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to stand up with me in supporting this legislation. We have to save lives.

julie hirschfeld davis

— some of the things that typically draw the most fervent responses from both parties. And so it attracts members who want to engage in that level of really partisan debate — people who really seek out the spotlight, who want to engage in culture war type of subjects that come before the Judiciary Committee, they sort of excel in these very highly partisan public debates. These debates that happen in the Judiciary Committee are typically much more raucous, much more freewheeling, and it’s a much more partisan place.

michael barbaro

So crude summary here. The Intelligence Committee is dominated by rule-oriented leaders, the workhorses. The Judiciary Committee is more dominated by cultural warriors, the show horses.

julie hirschfeld davis

That’s right. And to be clear, there is some overlap between the two committees. There are people who serve on both committees. And it’s not like everyone on the Judiciary Committee is guns blazing, culture warrior, and everyone on the Intelligence Committee is a dry consumer of long intelligence reports.

michael barbaro

[CHUCKLES]

julie hirschfeld davis

But that is the profile of these two committees, and those tend to be the sorts of people who seek out seats on the Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, so there is kind of a cultural difference there.

michael barbaro

So explain how these different roles of these two committees are actually playing out in this impeachment inquiry. Let’s start with the Intelligence Committee, since its work has just been completed. How has its broader role, its rules and its mission reflected in the work of the impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Intelligence Committee is used to working in secret, working in a setting where you’re controlling the flow of information. Because by definition, they’re dealing with intelligence matters, and that can’t be debated freely on the House floor in the halls. And its procedures also reflect that. There is less opportunity for the minority party to shut down the proceedings, because if they were allowed to do that, that could be dangerous. I mean, that has actual implications, potentially, for national security. So the very rules of the committee they’re used to operating under are just tighter by definition. And you saw Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, really using that to his advantage when it came to controlling the witness list, having a say in who Republicans would be able to call as public witnesses.

michael barbaro

Right.

julie hirschfeld davis

So Republicans, for instance, wanted to call Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, which — Democrats knew that that would be a red herring. And so they did not sign off on calling Hunter Biden. They did allow Republicans to call some witnesses. We saw them call Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who was a former National Security Council official. So they didn’t shut them down altogether, but again, the committee operates in this way where the rights of the minority are proscribed such that they can’t just do anything they want whenever they want.

michael barbaro

And what about the witnesses who the Democrats wanted to call? How did they use the Intelligence Committee’s rules to their advantage?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, they were very careful to design a process where the lawyers for each side would be doing, or could be doing, the bulk of the questioning. So that was a concerted move on the part of Adam Schiff, the chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) We’ll now move to the 45-minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes.

julie hirschfeld davis

— to have long, substantive rounds of, essentially, evidence gathering, taking the testimony and laying it out in a public way, rather than having lawmakers take turns and have it be a free-for-all of people trying to get their five minutes of soundbites in. And then when Republicans did try to upend things —

archived recording (devin nunes) I know, Ms. Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. I’ll yield to you, Ms. Stefanik. archived recording (elise stefanik) Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend.

julie hirschfeld davis

— Schiff really shut them down. There was a moment, a couple of hearings in, where Elise Stefanik, Republican congresswoman from New York, who Republicans wanted to spotlight, particularly because that day, they were hearing from a female witness, the former Ukraine ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. And they knew they were going to be accused of berating her and hammering at her, and she’s a woman and sort of mansplaining her. And so they really wanted Stefanik to have the spotlight.

archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. archived recording (elise stefanik) What is the interruption for this time? It is our time — archived recording (adam schiff) The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you are minority counsel — archived recording (devin nunes) I just recognized — archived recording (adam schiff) Under the House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel. archived recording (elise stefanik) The ranking member yielded time to another member of Congress. archived recording (adam schiff) No.

julie hirschfeld davis

They tried to yield time to her, and Schiff just shut it down.

archived recording (devin nunes) You’re gagging the young lady from New York? archived recording (elise stefanik) That is accurate. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to thank you for being here today. archived recording (adam schiff) Gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized.

michael barbaro

Right, and the rules would protect this sort of thing, theoretically, so that a member of the minority party on the Intelligence Committee wouldn’t, say, bring up the location of American C.I.A. agents overseas.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And granted, these issues that were coming up in the impeachment hearings were not strictly intelligence matters. There wasn’t necessarily a risk that anyone was going to go blabbing about black sites, but the rules that they were using were designed for those sorts of things. And so we saw Chairman Schiff take pretty good advantage of that.

michael barbaro

Right. Not that a bookish member of the Intelligence Committee would ever do such a thing, but just in case.

julie hirschfeld davis

Just in case.

michael barbaro

So the Republicans kind of get sidelined in this process because of these rules and the way the committee enforces them. What was the outcome for the Democrats who were overseeing this?

Well, the outcome was very much as they had hoped it would be. They really were able to use the process to get what they needed out of the witnesses that they called.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes.

julie hirschfeld davis

They laid out this narrative —

archived recording (adam schiff) It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.

julie hirschfeld davis

We were following the president’s orders.

archived recording (gordon sondland) So we followed the president’s orders.

julie hirschfeld davis

And basically got the information that they needed and the predicate for laying out a case against President Trump that could be grounds for impeachment.

archived recording We are going to House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff with a news conference on the impeachment committee report.

michael barbaro

Which brings us to Tuesday.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. So on Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee was ready to release its report and send it over to the House Judiciary Committee. So they put together this 300-page report, lots of footnotes, release it publicly. And then Adam Schiff, the committee chairman —

archived recording (adam schiff) Good afternoon.

julie hirschfeld davis

— goes to the press gallery in the Capitol and lays it all out.

archived recording (adam schiff) This report chronicles a scheme by the president of the United States to coerce an ally, Ukraine, that is at war with an adversary, Russia, into doing the president’s political dirty work. It involves a scheme in which Donald Trump withheld official acts, a White House meeting, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military assistance, in order to compel that power to deliver two investigations that he believed would assist his re-election campaign.

julie hirschfeld davis

And he raises this question again of whether people should have to accept that this is conduct that the president is allowed to engage in, and essentially lays out the predicate for what they’re going to give to the Judiciary Committee.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I’m happy to respond to your questions.

julie hirschfeld davis

Then Schiff takes questions from reporters, and the first question is about, essentially, the only really new thing that is not familiar to people who watched the hearings.

archived recording When did you obtain the cell phone records that are in this report?

julie hirschfeld davis

And that is the cell phone records that show contact between Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, and various White House officials, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser, but also Devin Nunes, who is the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and his contacts with Lev Parnas, who is an associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was also pushing for the ouster of the Ukrainian ambassador, who the president wanted gone.

archived recording (adam schiff) But certainly the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.

michael barbaro

You’re telling me, though, that we just learned in this report that the leading Republican on the Intelligence Committee was communicating, and perhaps coordinating, with the White House and the president’s lawyer months ago, and communicating with key figures involved in the pressure campaign that that very committee he’s on is supposed to be investigating?

julie hirschfeld davis

Correct. It’s pretty stunning information, although we don’t know what was discussed in those calls. All we have is timestamps and phone numbers, and so it’s tough to reconstruct what the substance of those calls were. But it’s a pretty unusual situation all around.

archived recording (adam schiff) It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity.

michael barbaro

Julie, what’s your understanding of why, given the juiciness of what you just described, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of closing shop and handing all its work over to the Judiciary Committee, rather than continuing to figure out what just happened with Nunes and with everything else in the report?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, Schiff says that he basically is not closing up shop. There are still questions about these calls, and also other broader issues — like did this pressure campaign actually begin much earlier with the previous president of Ukraine? — that they still want answered. But what he says is that —

archived recording (adam schiff) There was more investigative work to be done. Even as we believe that we cannot wait because the president’s efforts to secure intervention in the next election persist, we continue our investigation and we will.

julie hirschfeld davis

The president’s efforts to get a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election are ongoing. And so we need to move. We need to get this thing going. And what he doesn’t say, but what is also the case, is that the outcome here is pretty much known, at least in the House. They are very likely to draft articles of impeachment, to vote them through, to send the matter to the Senate. And Democrats believe that they have the evidence that they need to do that, and so this is the moment, they think, to get this thing moving.

michael barbaro

And so now the work of the Judiciary Committee begins.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. And on paper, they have a very simple and very somber task of taking this lengthy report and deciding whether this rises to the level of impeachable offenses, whether, under the Constitution, this is something that warrants the president’s removal. But remember, this is the Judiciary Committee. This is the messier, more partisan culture war committee, and nobody expects for this to be a very orderly or buttoned-down process.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Julie, the impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee. What makes it a messier place than the Intelligence Committee?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the rules of the Judiciary Committee are written for very different reasons than the rules of the Intelligence Committee are. They’re written to facilitate these freewheeling debates about policy and legislation and various matters that are of great interest to the public. So the minority has a lot of ability to interrupt the proceedings, to make points of order, to use parliamentary tactics to essentially make itself heard. Given that, and also given the members of the committee, it’s culturally a place of much more backing and forthing, and a pretty lively one.

michael barbaro

It feels like you’re saying that the best days of the impeachment inquiry for Democrats are now behind them.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it depends on your perspective. I think for some lawmakers, they have been waiting with great anticipation to have their moment to publicly say their piece about what they think about President Trump’s conduct, whether they’re Democrats and want to outline how egregiously horrible they think this has been, or Republicans and want to defend everything that the president has done. And for the rest of the Democratic caucus, I do think that there is some degree of worry that now is the part where things get really messy, where all of the talk of somber state debating goes out the window, and here we are in the Judiciary Committee having a food fight.

michael barbaro

Right. Nancy Pelosi is forever using this phrase. This is a “somber,” “prayerful” moment and process. And you’re saying it’s not going to be prayerful in that committee room.

julie hirschfeld davis

Probably will not look like most people’s image of prayerful.

michael barbaro

And what, specifically, will the Judiciary Committee be doing when it comes to determining the constitutionality of this impeachment inquiry?

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, their first step is to hold a hearing today with constitutional scholars, who will basically testify about the history of impeachment, precedence for impeachment, and really what the definition is of an impeachable offense. And it’s not necessarily straightforward. It’s not straightforward at all. The Constitution doesn’t say very much about what a president or another official could be impeached for. There are certain phrases in there, like “high crimes and misdemeanors,” that have been hotly debated by legal scholars. So is a high crime a particularly egregious actual crime, or is it wrongdoing by a high official? That’s something that they’re going to have to work out. And on Tuesday, we saw the Democrats start to signal what their argument is going to be about, what counts as impeachable, and that it doesn’t have to be a crime. They quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Intelligence Committee report, explaining that impeachment is not only designed to cover criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. And they quote Hamilton saying, “The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They’re of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.”

michael barbaro

They don’t write like that anymore.

julie hirschfeld davis

No, for better or for worse.

michael barbaro

And is this always how the Judiciary Committee functions during an impeachment? I mean, calling constitutional scholars, professors, historians to basically ruminate on the very nature of what is impeachable?

archived recording The purpose of today’s hearing is to receive testimony from legal and constitutional scholars on the background and history of impeachment.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, the Judiciary Committee did do this same thing, back just before they started impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

archived recording The most important question to this committee is the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is important to remember that the word “high” in high crimes and misdemeanors was used to emphasize that it was a crime or misdemeanor against the commonwealth.

julie hirschfeld davis

And part of it is just laying out the reference points for them to be able to go back to to say, remember when these people who studied the Constitution and told us what it was all about and told us what impeachment was for said about what we should be considering? And so it’s a way for them to kind of give the public a concept of why they would be doing this.

michael barbaro

I get how the rules vary here in ways that would make the Judiciary Committee a messier process than the Intelligence Committee, but I’m honestly having a hard time imagining how interviewing constitutional scholars gets all that messy.

julie hirschfeld davis

Well, it has to do with what they’re interviewing the scholars about and the very, very different places that the Republicans and Democrats on the committee are coming from about that issue. They’re essentially going to be arguing over the Constitution and trying to compete with one another to elicit from these constitutional scholars the most favorable interpretation of what impeachment means and what the standard is for their side. So rather than arguing over who said what in a phone call with the Ukrainian president, or whether civil servants’ view of what President Trump did is legitimate or not legitimate, they’re actually going to be arguing over the Constitution itself and what those words, those few words that are in the Constitution about impeachment, actually mean in the context of what President Trump has done.

michael barbaro

Julie, you’ve said that it’s widely understood that the House is going to vote to impeach the president. That’s one of the reasons Schiff was in such a hurry to move this from the Intelligence Committee over to the Judiciary Committee. So what are these two different phases that you’ve been describing? Why do they ultimately matter? I mean, why does it matter that the Intelligence Committee ran this as a tightly controlled, buttoned-up process, and that it’s likely to get a lot messier in the Judiciary Committee, if we know the outcome of all this basically beforehand?

julie hirschfeld davis

Because I think there is a broader question of what does impeaching a president look like when it’s a purely partisan exercise? The Democrats opened this process with what was essentially a partisan vote to begin an impeachment inquiry. And if they engage now in a spectacle, in a sort of war, on the public stage over impeaching the president, they are very aware that they could lose whatever public support they do have for going forward with this, and that people could come away thinking that they have not been conscientious about what their constitutional duty is, that they’ve abused their positions and treated impeachment just like another partisan fight that they have with President Trump that essentially would trivialize the process, both in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of history. This is, after all, a process that’s enshrined in the Constitution, and Democrats don’t want to be the ones who are blamed with tainting that process and undermining it. So there is a real risk for them that in this realm that they’re about to enter, that they’re going to come off looking like less than they should.

michael barbaro

Right. They could undermine what the Intelligence Committee seemed to have pulled off, in part because of the rules that allowed for it, that gave the power to the majority, and therefore allowed them to conduct that first phase in a way that seemed kind of high-minded and, as Nancy Pelosi would say, prayerful.

julie hirschfeld davis

Right. They largely hit their mark in the first phase of this inquiry, and now they are keenly aware that, having demonstrated to the public that they are taking this seriously, that they’re being disciplined about how they’re going about it, that they’re honoring the process, that it could all unravel.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who began her presidential campaign as a top-tier candidate with record crowds, has dropped out of the race —

Telegenic, highly educated and from a multiethnic background, she would have been an ideal candidate in the pre-Obama era. We expected her to create an All-American narrative that is relatable to a wide cross-section of the country; that’s how President Barack Obama ascended in 2004. But Ms. Harris failed to do that.

As we write eulogies of this once promising campaign, which ended on Tuesday, it is important that we talk about more than just personal failings by Ms. Harris and her staff members. We need to talk also about what campaigning looks like for black women and what challenges and hurdles the Harris campaign laid bare. There are biases and structural disadvantages that can be found in the subtle ways the media and the public responded to her candidacy.

Ms. Harris entered the race after having been elected to multiple statewide offices in California, a difficult hurdle for black candidates but especially black women. It was a sign that she could attract support from a diverse set of voters and raise a significant amount of money, both necessary for a viable presidential bid. That she did this in a large blue state was also a selling point.

But from the beginning, Ms. Harris struggled with her personal narrative. I first saw this in February at a rally for black women hosted by the Democratic strategist Leah Daughtry. A room full of hundreds of black women, even in their skepticism, wanted Ms. Harris to be excellent and were open to being persuaded. Yet, in the end, there was more doubt about her ability to secure the support of black voters, with whom she shared a racial identity. Since then, I’ve seen her at other public events, and it seemed as if she wasn’t sure which story would be compelling — the California prosecutor, the Obama-esque candidate, the child-of-immigrants success story. She tried them all, but it was alienating for those watching."

Ms. Harris, a graduate of Howard University an H.B.C.U. in Washington, proposed $70 billion for H.B.C.U.s in a plan she announced over the summer, with a particular focus on STEM education as well. (On Tuesday, Ms. Harris dropped out of the presidential race.)

Ms. Warren committed to investing a minimum of $50 billion into H.B.C.U.s, paid for by her wealth tax proposal, within her overarching plan to make public college free and to cancel most student loan debt. She said she would seek to increase the budget with her secretary of education to ensure equity in spending per student compared with other colleges in a given area.

Mr. Sanders, who also proposed universal free public college and canceling all student loan debt, pledged to make similar investments in H.B.C.U.s with a focus on educating teachers and those in the medical field. In addition, Mr. Sanders also proposed canceling the $1.6 billion in existing loan debt H.B.C.U.s face through the current Capital Financing Program.

Last month, Mr. Buttigieg wrote an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun, also promising to invest $50 billion in H.B.C.U.s.

Mr. Biden proposed more than $70 billion in investments for H.B.C.U.s, with dedicated funds to specific needs, such as $10 billion to create at least 200 new research incubators, $20 billion in high tech labs, facilities and digital infrastructure and another $18 billion in grants to help with tuition at four-year colleges , equivalent to up to two years of tuition per low-income and middle-class student s.

Ms. Warren forecasts she can raise more than $2 trillion solely by cracking down on companies that underpay their American tax liability.

Mr. Biden “is committed to being transparent with the American people about the smart and effective ways he’d pay for the bold changes he’s proposing,” said his policy director, Stef Feldman. “He believes that being forthright with voters about how plans would be financed is critical to building the public support necessary to beat Donald Trump, help more Democrats win up and down the ballot, and then pass legislation through Congress.”

Some high-earners — those who make around $450,000 a year — would pay lower tax rates under Mr. Biden’s plan than they did during the Obama administration, when Mr. Biden was vice president. That is a deliberate choice by Mr. Biden: He proposes returning the top income tax bracket to 39.6 percent, after Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax law cut it to 37 percent.

But Mr. Biden would only subject individuals’ income above $510,000 to that top rate. Before the Trump tax cuts, the top rate started at just under $420,000 for individuals.

Mr. Biden would also repeal a limitation that the Trump tax law placed on the deduction of state and local taxes from federal taxes. The law capped the so-called SALT deduction at $10,000 for individuals or households, a change that raised taxes on some higher-earning taxpayers in high-tax and predominantly Democratic states like California, New York and New Jersey.

Corporations would also be subject to a lower rate under Mr. Biden’s plan than they were before the passage of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts. The 2017 cuts reduced the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent. Mr. Biden would raise it to 28 percent — the same rate Mr. Obama proposed in a tax overhaul plan he was unable to push through as president.

Mr. Biden would unambiguously raise taxes on millionaires, and not just by lifting the top rate. He would raise the tax rate on capital gains — the proceeds from the sale of a stock, vacation home or other investment asset — to 39.6 percent from 23.8 percent, for taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year. He would also limit those taxpayers’ itemized deductions and eliminate an inflation adjustment at death that reduces capital gains liabilities for wealthy heirs."

That effort in turn has led to the impeachment proceedings in the House against the president."

Ah, but there’s the rub: All this overspending creates a lot of employment — and moving toward a more efficient and equitable health care system will inevitably mean getting rid of many administrative jobs. One study suggests that about 1.8 million jobs would be rendered unnecessary if America adopted a public health care financing system.

So what if some of these jobs involve debt collection, claims denial, aggressive legal action or are otherwise punitive, cruel or simply morally indefensible in a society that can clearly afford to provide high-quality health care to everyone? Jobs are jobs, folks, as Joe Biden might say.

Indeed, that’s exactly what Biden’s presidential campaign is saying about the Medicare for all plans that Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing: They “will not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost two million jobs,” a Biden campaign official warned recently.

Note the word “kill” in the statement. That word might better describe not what could happen to jobs under Medicare for all but what the health care industry is doing to many Americans today.

Last week, the medical journal JAMA published a comprehensive study examining the cause of a remarkably grim statistic about our national well-being. From 1959 to 2010, life expectancy in the United States and in other wealthy countries around the world climbed. Then, in 2014, American life expectancy began to fall, while it continued to rise elsewhere.

What caused the American decline? Researchers identified a number of potential factors, including tobacco use, obesity and psychological stress, but two of the leading causes can be pinned directly on the peculiarities and dysfunctions of American health care.

The first is the opioid epidemic, whose rise can be traced to the release, in 1996, of the prescription pain drug OxyContin. In the public narrative, much of the blame for the epidemic has been cast on the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, created OxyContin and pushed for its widespread use. But research has shown that the Sacklers exploited aberrant incentives in American health care."

After I wrote a column a couple of months ago about the promise and disappointment of Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, one Times reader from Boston left a comment that I thought was particularly smart. “Prosecutors rarely translate well when it comes to governing at the executive level,” the reader wrote. “Their default mode is neither policy nor the long view.”

Harris came up through California politics as a prosecutor. And she never seemed to develop a clear theory of how to use government to improve people’s lives. Barack Obama, who worked as a state legislator, did develop such a theory. So did Bill Clinton, who started as a prosecutor but then spent years as a governor. So has Elizabeth Warren, who came from academia.

An especially interesting contrast this year is Pete Buttigieg, whose résumé is less impressive than Harris’s and who, in my view, isn’t as charismatic as she is. But when I listen to Buttigieg describe his vision, I understand it. His time as a mayor of a small city shaped that vision, much as it did for Bernie Sanders decades earlier. With Harris, I was never quite sure what her vision was. Her vaguely titled memoir (“The Truths We Hold”) and oddly flat campaign slogans (like “Justice Is on the Ballot”) captured the problem."

It is hard to look at this field of candidates and not remember a cascading list of missteps. And many of them have things in their past for which they have apologized. But one question is why missteps are fatal to some campaigns and not others.

It is fair to ask what role racism and sexism played in her campaign’s demise. These are two “isms” that are permanent, obvious and unavoidable in American society.

It is fair to ask how those features impacted media coverage, or the lack of coverage.

It is fair to ask about the Democratic debate rules and how they prioritize donations in addition to polls, thereby advantaging the opinions of people who can afford to give over those who can’t.

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

Telegenic, highly educated and from a multiethnic background, she would have been an ideal candidate in the pre-Obama era. We expected her to create an All-American narrative that is relatable to a wide cross-section of the country; that’s how President Barack Obama ascended in 2004. But Ms. Harris failed to do that.

As we write eulogies of this once promising campaign, which ended on Tuesday, it is important that we talk about more than just personal failings by Ms. Harris and her staff members. We need to talk also about what campaigning looks like for black women and what challenges and hurdles the Harris campaign laid bare. There are biases and structural disadvantages that can be found in the subtle ways the media and the public responded to her candidacy.

Ms. Harris entered the race after having been elected to multiple statewide offices in California, a difficult hurdle for black candidates but especially black women. It was a sign that she could attract support from a diverse set of voters and raise a significant amount of money, both necessary for a viable presidential bid. That she did this in a large blue state was also a selling point.

But from the beginning, Ms. Harris struggled with her personal narrative. I first saw this in February at a rally for black women hosted by the Democratic strategist Leah Daughtry. A room full of hundreds of black women, even in their skepticism, wanted Ms. Harris to be excellent and were open to being persuaded. Yet, in the end, there was more doubt about her ability to secure the support of black voters, with whom she shared a racial identity. Since then, I’ve seen her at other public events, and it seemed as if she wasn’t sure which story would be compelling — the California prosecutor, the Obama-esque candidate, the child-of-immigrants success story. She tried them all, but it was alienating for those watching."

Our debate criteria reflects this.”

Leah D. Daughtry, a longtime Democratic National Committee member who sits on the party’s rules committee, said she’s had a number of conversations in recent days with other members about how to change the system to include more candidates of color. No one has come up with a workable solution.

“I don’t know how you fix it now without upsetting the apple cart,” she said. “But it’s a problem. It’s a real problem.”

Some prominent Democrats say the party cannot be blamed for the failure of candidates of color to make the stage, placing responsibility on their inability to build momentum for their efforts — particularly among black and Latino voters.

A growing number of voters, especially younger black voters, have rejected the notion that mere representation equals the kind of change the Democratic base is hungry for. Polls have consistently shown the former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. leading among African-American voters, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is widely popular among Latinos.

“When people make the case that the standards and requirements should be lowered so that candidates of color can make the debate, as a Latina, I find that insulting,” said Maria Cardona, a former D.N.C. official. “The reason why the candidates right now are the ones at the top of the polls are because these are the candidates who are getting the majority of support from, guess who, voters of color.”

In the 1980s, he created the Bloomberg Terminal, a financial tool for investors that would make him a billionaire. And in 2001, Bloomberg ran for mayor of New York City as a Republican. “That should make a great politician.” Then in the middle of his campaign, New York City changed forever on Sept. 11. As New York’s outgoing mayor took the national stage, he gave Bloomberg the thumbs up. “Well, I’m urging people to vote for Mike Bloomberg.” “I, Michael R. Bloomberg —” Bloomberg won. One of his priorities as mayor was tackling public health. “Sixty-four ounce. Just think about that.” “Don’t go near these things.” He also pushed for controversial stop-and-frisk policies that disproportionately affected minority communities. “Everything the New York City Police Department has done is absolutely —is legal.” But just days before entering the presidential race this year, he apologized. “I just want you to know that I realize back then, I was wrong.” In 2007, he left the G.O.P. And in 2008, during the financial crisis, he asked the City Council to extend term limits in order to let him run for a controversial third term. “Yes.” “No.” “No.” “Aye.” “Aye.” The vote passed, and he won re-election. “We’re going to make the next four years the best yet.” So what about the issues? After he left office in 2013, Bloomberg went back to running his company, which includes a news division. But he’s also focused on supporting candidates … “Let’s elect a sane, competent person.” … and causes he cares about, many of which are now key parts of his platform. Bloomberg is a vocal supporter of gun reform. “We cannot have a society where you go out in the street, and you can get blown away. We just have to say enough is enough.” He also has big plans for health care reform and fighting climate change. “Trump has done us a favor. Every time he riles against climate change, the money comes flooding in.” Overall, Bloomberg is positioning himself as a moderate in the Democratic field. “With the right candidate, we can turn areas from red to blue.” So what about his chances? They’re somewhat unknown. As a billionaire and fellow New Yorker, Bloomberg supporters feel he is uniquely positioned to take on President Trump. “I’m a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.” “There is nobody I’d rather run against than ‘Little Michael.’ That I can tell you.” But he has challenges ahead. He’s as not well known outside of New York City. Also, Bloomberg probably won’t participate in any of the Democratic debates, and he’s likely to skip the early primaries and caucuses. His hope: to surge on Super Tuesday and chart a path to the nomination. “I am running for president to defeat Donald Trump, and to unite and rebuild America.”"

That is a deliberate choice by Mr. Biden: He proposes returning the top income tax bracket to 39.6 percent, after Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax law cut it to 37 percent.

But Mr. Biden would only subject individuals’ income above $510,000 to that top rate. Before the Trump tax cuts, the top rate started at just under $420,000 for individuals.

Mr. Biden would also repeal a limitation that the Trump tax law placed on the deduction of state and local taxes from federal taxes. The law capped the so-called SALT deduction at $10,000 for individuals or households, a change that raised taxes on some higher-earning taxpayers in high-tax and predominantly Democratic states like California, New York and New Jersey.

Corporations would also be subject to a lower rate under Mr. Biden’s plan than they were before the passage of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts. The 2017 cuts reduced the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent. Mr. Biden would raise it to 28 percent — the same rate Mr. Obama proposed in a tax overhaul plan he was unable to push through as president.

Mr. Biden would unambiguously raise taxes on millionaires, and not just by lifting the top rate. He would raise the tax rate on capital gains — the proceeds from the sale of a stock, vacation home or other investment asset — to 39.6 percent from 23.8 percent, for taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year. He would also limit those taxpayers’ itemized deductions and eliminate an inflation adjustment at death that reduces capital gains liabilities for wealthy heirs."

Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, according to people familiar with the effort.

The former prosecutors, who have faced allegations of corruption, all played some role in promoting claims about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a former United States ambassador to Ukraine and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information about Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in 2016.

Those claims — some baseless and others with key disputed elements — have been the foundations of the effort by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to commit itself to investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump heading into his re-election campaign. That effort in turn has led to the impeachment proceedings in the House against the president."

Democrats Say Yes,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/Elizabeth-Warren-tax-increases.html,"Ms. Warren is making the case that the economy could benefit if money is redistributed from the rich and corporations to uses that she and other liberals say would be more productive. Their argument combines hard data showing that high levels of inequality and wealth concentration weigh down economic growth with a belief that well-targeted government spending can encourage more Americans to work, invest and build skills that would make them more productive.

Fueling their argument is the fact that the United States now has one of the lowest corporate tax burdens among developed nations — a direct result of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Tax revenues at all levels of government in the United States fell to 24.3 percent of the economy last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported on Thursday, down from 26.8 percent in 2017. America is now has the fourth lowest tax burden in all of the O.E.C.D., just above Mexico, Chile and Ireland, a development that Democrats say has helped corporate executives and shareholders get rich but has done little to help working Americans.

In making their pitch, Democrats cite evidence that transferring money to poor and middle-class individuals would increase consumer spending because they spend a larger share of their incomes than wealthy Americans, who tend to save and invest.

“The economy has changed, our understanding of it has changed, and we understand the constricting effects of inequality” on growth, said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality.

Inequality has widened significantly in America over the last several decades. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the incomes of the top 1 percent of Americans more than tripled from 1979 to 2016, before taxes and government transfer payments are taken into account. For the middle class, incomes grew 33 percent. More than a decade after the recession, wage growth for the middle class continues to run well behind previous times of economic expansion, like the late 1990s.

Research by the economist Emmanuel Saez and colleagues shows that the last time such a small sliver of Americans controlled such a large share of the nation’s income and wealth was in the late 1920s, just before a stock market crash set off the Great Depression. World Bank researchers have warned that high levels of inequality are stifling growth in South Africa, which has the globe’s worst measured inequality."

But a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the nation remains in a period of relatively slow growth in health spending.

Health spending in the United States rose by 4.6 percent to $3.6 trillion in 2018 — accounting for 17.7 percent of the economy — compared to a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. Federal officials said the slight acceleration was largely the result of reinstating a tax on health insurers that the Affordable Care Act imposed but Congress had suspended for a year in 2017. Faster growth in medical prices and prescription drug spending were also factors, they said, but comparatively minor.

For decades, national health spending galloped ahead of spending in the overall economy, lowering wages and stressing household budgets. But over the last decade, the pattern has shifted somewhat. Although the country consistently spends more on health care each year than it did the year before, the overall rate of growth has stayed below historical averages. In 2018, health spending grew more slowly than the economy overall, a rare occurrence .

The factors leading to the slowdown are not fully understood. For years, economists thought they were the result of lagging effects of the recession. But as the pattern has continued far into the economic recovery, they increasingly point to changes in the delivery of health care itself."

Ah, but there’s the rub: All this overspending creates a lot of employment — and moving toward a more efficient and equitable health care system will inevitably mean getting rid of many administrative jobs. One study suggests that about 1.8 million jobs would be rendered unnecessary if America adopted a public health care financing system.

So what if some of these jobs involve debt collection, claims denial, aggressive legal action or are otherwise punitive, cruel or simply morally indefensible in a society that can clearly afford to provide high-quality health care to everyone? Jobs are jobs, folks, as Joe Biden might say.

Indeed, that’s exactly what Biden’s presidential campaign is saying about the Medicare for all plans that Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing: They “will not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost two million jobs,” a Biden campaign official warned recently.

Note the word “kill” in the statement. That word might better describe not what could happen to jobs under Medicare for all but what the health care industry is doing to many Americans today.

Last week, the medical journal JAMA published a comprehensive study examining the cause of a remarkably grim statistic about our national well-being. From 1959 to 2010, life expectancy in the United States and in other wealthy countries around the world climbed. Then, in 2014, American life expectancy began to fall, while it continued to rise elsewhere.

What caused the American decline? Researchers identified a number of potential factors, including tobacco use, obesity and psychological stress, but two of the leading causes can be pinned directly on the peculiarities and dysfunctions of American health care.

The first is the opioid epidemic, whose rise can be traced to the release, in 1996, of the prescription pain drug OxyContin. In the public narrative, much of the blame for the epidemic has been cast on the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, created OxyContin and pushed for its widespread use. But research has shown that the Sacklers exploited aberrant incentives in American health care."

The president himself has unleashed a stream of unfounded accusations against the Bidens and pushed for them to appear at a potential impeachment trial in the Senate.

There is no evidence that the elder Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, improperly intervened in Ukraine to benefit his son.

The barrage of attacks is the latest example of Mr. Trump’s monthslong fixation with Mr. Biden, who leads the Democratic field in national polling and has bested the president in head-to-head surveys in several key battleground states.

Hello.

How are you?

Nice to see you, Michael.

Hi, Jessica Cheung.

bernie sanders

Jessica. Nice to see you. Where would you like me?

michael barbaro

Very nice to meet you, Michael Barbaro. So, Senator Sanders, my colleague Alex Burns told me that to understand your political career, and your presidential campaign today, we have to go back to the first time that you won elected office as mayor of Burlington in 1981. So that’s —

bernie sanders

The New York Times got it right. Every once in a while.

michael barbaro

So that’s what I want to ask you about.

bernie sanders

All right, there you go.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Burlington is the largest city in Vermont. Situated as it is on Lake Champlain with the Adirondack Mountains view, it’s a lovely, lovely spot. We’d like you to meet its new mayor. Mayor Sanders got a lot of attention recently, not only with his ten vote victory, but mostly because he is a socialist.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ronald Reagan and his billionaire friends do not represent America, but we do. Lastly, I want to touch upon an issue that dear to my heart, and that is the issue of affordable health care. The people of Burlington voted overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly in support of Congress moving forward to establish a national health care system. I think that is exactly how this country is going to have to go on that issue.

michael barbaro

It’s Friday, December 6. Alex Burns, why this moment?

alex burns

Bernie Sanders is such an unusual character in American politics, as a lifelong socialist and left wing activist who has endured for decades as a major political figure, and who has become a leading presidential candidate. And to understand how he got from, really, the fringes of American politics to the absolute forefront, you have to go back to this moment in the early 1980s where he becomes mayor of Burlington, where he figures out how to take those ideas and actually win elections with them, and then govern. This is a period I’ve been spending a lot of time on in my own reporting because it’s just such a vital formative experience for Sanders. And so the story starts with the turn of the 1970s as Bernie Sanders arrives in Vermont with a whole lot of left wing ideas, not a whole lot of local connections, and links up with a new marginal political party called the Liberty Union.

bernie sanders

And that party had been formed around opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in the fight for economic justice. It’s a very small party in a very small state.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders starts showing up to Liberty Union meetings, and the party identifies him as the man they want to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 1971.

bernie sanders

And it was a very interesting campaign, and so forth, and so on. I got two percent of the vote.

michael barbaro

He loses that election, but then he has gotten the electoral bug.

bernie sanders

A year later, there was the general election. I ran for governor of the state, I got one percent.

michael barbaro

He loses again.

bernie sanders

Then I ran for Senate again against Pat Leahy, as Leahy often reminds me, and I got four percent.

michael barbaro

And again, he loses. I’m seeing a pattern here.

bernie sanders

Yes.

michael barbaro

It is loss, after loss, after loss. And while he’s running and losing, he has a series of odd jobs.

bernie sanders

I was doing some writing. I was banging nails, doing a little bit of carpentry work.

michael barbaro

He also had a job putting together newsreels and educational film strips about history for school kids.

bernie sanders

That’s before video. For younger people, there was a thing called film strips. I won’t go through what they were, photographs and sound. And I did most of the work myself, had a little bit of help, photography and so forth. It was lot of fun, actually.

michael barbaro

He sells these films to schools in the region, and he also spends time putting together a project that he’s personally quite invested in and proud of.

archived recording If you are the average American who watches television 40 hours a week, you have probably heard of such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman. Strangely enough, however, nobody has told you about Eugene Debs, one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.

michael barbaro

Which is a film about the life of the legendary American socialist leader, Eugene Debs.

bernie sanders

Debs was a very great American. He was one of the original founders of industrial unionism, socialist party candidate for president six times, somebody I admired a whole lot.

archived recording (eugene debs) The ruling class has always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war, and to have yourself slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world, you the people have never had a voice in declaring war.

michael barbaro

So throughout the 1970s, he is this activist educator who is running campaign after campaign, and losing every time. He’s not really developing a professional or political career for himself in Vermont. But in the city of Burlington —

bernie sanders

In 1980 or so, some friends of mine came up to me. And they said, you know, there’s going to be a mayor’s election coming up in ‘81. And you know what, we checked the records, and you did pretty well running as a Liberty Union candidate. You got actually 12 percent of the vote in some of the working class districts in Burlington.

michael barbaro

So two percent, or four percent, or six percent —

bernie sanders

That was statewide. But in Burlington, we did better.

michael barbaro

You were doing better.

bernie sanders

Yeah. So we got a bunch of people together, and they said, O.K., we’ll do it.

archived recording Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn born self-described socialist running for mayor for the first time in 1981, running against a Democratic old guard that had run the city for a decade.

michael barbaro

When Sanders becomes a candidate for mayor, he is facing off against a powerful Democratic establishment. Burlington at this point, for decades has been essentially a one party town with a relatively conservative Democratic ruling clique that has just had a hammerlock on city politics. The incumbent mayor is not seen by anybody as vulnerable, to the point that the Republicans don’t even field a candidate against him. He’s also up against, just a culture of apathy when it comes to municipal elections. People generally don’t show up to vote for mayor, or for other city offices. So Bernie Sanders and this kind of ragtag group of academics and activists and intellectuals band together to try to figure out how to crack a city election in a place where nobody like them has ever won before.

bernie sanders

You would literally not believe if I told you how little we knew about politics. At the end of the day, I mean, real politics. It’s one thing to run for statewide office knowing you’re not going to win and get on our radio show and talk about issues, which I could do, but the nitty-gritty of politics.

michael barbaro

So as a newcomer to city politics, Bernie Sanders runs a different kind of campaign from the campaigns he’s run before. This isn’t about 30,000 foot ideological issues, like when he was a protest candidate for the Senate.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ruth, you’re a volunteer worker at the old North end food co-op here in Burlington. archived recording Right. We’re on disability, social security. archived recording (bernie sanders) You got cut from $131 to — archived recording $48. archived recording (bernie sanders) And what was the justification for that? How do they expect you to live on the difference? archived recording They don’t care.

michael barbaro

This is a ground level campaign that’s waged over really concrete kitchen table issues that are relevant, he hopes, to a wide array of constituencies in the city that feel like they’ve been left out by the existing power structure.

bernie sanders

We had a lot of support in, for example, low income housing projects from people were getting a raw deal from the city that ran the projects. We had support from environmental groups. We had support from one group in the south end of the city. There was going to be a major highway going right through the neighborhood, and they said, we don’t like that.

michael barbaro

So Sanders is gaining some real support in this race. He’s not a trivial candidate, but still, the powers that be in Burlington do not see him as a threat to win this election. Let me talk about election night. What was the story of that night for you?

bernie sanders

Well, when I walked in on election day, I was of two opinions. Number one, that we would lose very heavily. And the newspapers, some guy, a newspaper writer was covering it, he said, the odds of Sanders winning are about 100 to one. That was literally what they wrote. So either we were doing something magical, or we would lose overwhelmingly. What I did not anticipate is that on election night, I think the results were, we were ahead by 14 votes. And after the recount, 10 votes. That, I did not expect.

archived recording Many people in Burlington are still in a state of shock following that city’s most stunning political upset in memory last night.

michael barbaro

The press reports from election night describe him as stunned, and then elated that he wins. And he wins by the absolute narrowest of margins, just ten votes.

alex burns

Ten votes.

archived recording Bernard Sanders, one of the founders of the Liberty Union Party, and a consistent loser in previous quests for elective office, was now the big winner. Considered by many to be unelectable because of his so-called radical views, Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition of supporters and edged the ten year incumbent Gordon Paquette.

michael barbaro

So your strategy had worked. When you take office, how did becoming an elected official, the day to day reality of it, match your expectations of the power of winning this office and being mayor?

bernie sanders

Well, we had a very unique experience.

alex burns

Bernie Sanders has pulled off an extraordinary feat. He has upended the city establishment, he has become a socialist mayor in the United States at the height of the Cold War. But what happens next is he runs into a brick wall of political opposition. There is a body in Burlington, the Board of Aldermen. We would call it a city council. There are 13 members, 11 of them are either Democrats or Republicans, but their party label matters less than the fact that they are opposed to Bernie Sanders. He comes in, the powerful Democrats and the powerful Republicans both essentially say, he should not be the mayor of the city, and he will not be the mayor of the city for very long. Because we’re going to make sure that he can’t get anything done.

michael barbaro

People were trying to sabotage you?

bernie sanders

Trying to sabotage me, yes. They were trying to sabotage me. The first thing they did was to fire my secretary.

michael barbaro

They have the power to fire your secretary?

bernie sanders

Yeah, they did.

michael barbaro

So they reject his secretary. They take it back pretty quickly, but the damage to the relationship is kind of done. Not only do the board of Aldermen mess with his ability to hire a secretary, they reject all of his nominees for the top jobs in the city, city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney.

bernie sanders

And they made me run the city for the first year with exactly the administration of the guy I had beaten. You know, it’s like —

michael barbaro

You’re being neutered.

bernie sanders

Yes. So it’s like, you know, Donald Trump running his administration with Barack Obama’s appointees.

alex burns

So for really his first full year as mayor, he has a somewhat ornamental role.

michael barbaro

How are how are you thinking about this challenge?

bernie sanders

Well, their attitude, what they had said, and one of their leaders said, well, look. Bernie Sanders is a fluke. That was the word they used, and they said —

michael barbaro

Your brand of politics, everything about you, they thought was just a fluke.

bernie sanders

Right, this is an accident that should never have happened. And we will stonewall him in the first year, people will see that he can’t accomplish anything, then we’ll go back to the old ways.

michael barbaro

They’re going to drive you from office.

bernie sanders

Yeah. Well, it was a brutal year. So what we had to do was literally form a parallel city government without any money. I mean, we didn’t, couldn’t pay anybody, but we brought together a group of strong supporters and we had them helping us working on legislation and ideas. And we did everything that we could while we were being absolutely opposed by the Democratic and Republicans on the board of Aldermen. So we organized at the grass-roots level, we mobilize people. Our job was to get people involved in the political process.

michael barbaro

How did you do that?

bernie sanders

Well, I’ll tell you how we did it. Even before I took office, we had meetings on issues that people were concerned about that had been ignored for a very long time. We said, we believe in arts. You know, a city has got to be vital and alive. What do we do about the arts? What do we do about economic development? What do we do about women’s rights? So we ended up storming a council on Arts, a council on women, a council on youth. We started what we called neighborhood planning associations, which meant we gave local neighborhoods, each ward had a certain amount of money and they spent it however they wanted. So we tried to democratize it, and we brought people into the process. So it wasn’t me saying, we’re going to do A, B and C. These were people who themselves were now empowered.

michael barbaro

So you’re finding a way to essentially circumvent these aldermen who think you’re a fluke, and think they can block you by literally tapping into —

bernie sanders

Right.

michael barbaro

More voters, more people. When did you know that this strategy was actually working?

bernie sanders

Well, when hundreds of people would show up at city council meetings and demand our agenda. We were fighting for an agenda, it was being blocked by the city council. So people were upset about it, and here’s the interesting thing: We have elections for mayor then every two years, but half the board of Aldermen comes up on the odd year.

michael barbaro

So in 1982, one year after Sanders becomes mayor, seven of the 13 members of the board of aldermen are up for re-election.

bernie sanders

Essentially, there was a referendum on my administration.

michael barbaro

These elections became a chance for Mayor Sanders to go directly to the voters and ask them to replace these intransigent members of the board of aldermen with people who are friendly to him and supportive of his ideas.

bernie sanders

We ran candidates in almost every ward in the city. I probably have never worked so hard in my life. I knocked on almost every door in the city with the candidates that we were running with. And this is the winter time in Vermont, so we’re talking about 10 below zero, in zero weather. And on election night, the turnout was phenomenal for a non-mayor’s race, it was just off the charts. In five — if my memory is correct, in the five wards that we ran in, we won outright three of the wards, in all of the working class areas. And here is the most exciting thing about all of this. If you go back to the basement of City Hall and check the old records in Burlington, what you’ll find is that between 1979, that was the previous election before I won, and two years later when I was running for re-election we doubled voter turnout.

michael barbaro

He’s right, voter turnout really did rise in Burlington when Sanders got involved in city politics. And some of that is about him and his message and his political organization. Some of it is just having contested elections, elections where people file to run against the people who are already sitting in public office. When you have two choices rather than one, then yeah, more people show up to make a choice.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Good evening. We’re recording this on Friday, March 5th, and we’ve decided to get out of City Hall, get out of the office. And we’re here on the first floor the Burlington Square Mall.

michael barbaro

And he continues to engage and attempt to inspire voters in this same way, getting out in the community. He’s a highly visible mayor.

archived recording (bernie sanders) And I think what we’ll do is have some informal discussions with Vermonters as they walk past us, and as we can grab them. And we’ll see if we can get their views on some of the important issues of the day. But before we do —

michael barbaro

He creates a local television show called “Bernie Speaks With the Community,” where he is just out there and connected to your average voter.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Oops, oh, here we go. archived recording Hi, Shannon. archived recording (bernie sanders) Shannon, do you live in Burlington, Shannon? archived recording Yeah. archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. So how are things going with you? archived recording Pretty good. I was just wondering, my mother had this idea for an indoor/outdoor amusement park by the waterfront, and she wanted — and I want to know if, is there anything going to be done about it? archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, I can’t say for sure that something will be done immediately. I think it is a good idea, and interestingly enough, your mother mentioned —

michael barbaro

It’s a highly unusual approach for a municipal politician, and especially in a city where the mayor had not been that kind of man about town previous.

archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. The next person that we’ve kidnapped here off the streets for a few words is Jodie Baggerly. Jodie, welcome. archived recording (jodie baggerly) Well, thank you. One thing I want to appreciate, being a disabled person, is the little discount we get on our cable TVs, because I think it’s a positive point to have educational programs to be able to watch and fill our minds at periods when we are unable to get out. archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me just jump in and remind our viewers. What Jodie is talking about is, the city negotiated with the Mountain Cable Company —

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, in brief, what are the lessons of this moment for you?

bernie sanders

Lessons of this moment is that winning politics is grass-roots politics, that winning politics is developing coalitions of working people, of low income people, of women, of environmentalists. So coalition is, we do it from the bottom on up, and we ended up in my years as mayor taking on everybody.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Alex, in Sanders’s telling, in the face of total political opposition and stonewalling, his solution is to essentially do what got him political power in the first place, which is go to the people, talk to the people, always the people.

alex burns

That’s his political brand as mayor, much as it’s his political brand now. And in Burlington, it’s an approach that really works for him. It establishes him as a legitimate city executive with an independent power base who cannot just be treated as an interloper in City Hall. It’s also the first of a couple stages in Mayor Sanders’ campaign to reinvent Burlington city politics. And if the first part of that is about really engaging with city politics at the ground level, the next stage after he’s been mayor for a couple of years, is to look way beyond Burlington and take on big national and international political issues, and connect them back to the local level.

archived recording If I were the president of the largest bank in Burlington, I’d be real nervous about you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, they may be, they may be. But I think — and they are. But I think what we’ve often talked about also, is that my powers as mayor are in many ways limited. And I have my visions as to what life should be in Vermont, in Burlington, and in the United States, but we are going to speak out, though, on national and international issues which affect the city of Burlington. For example, obviously, we’re very concerned about Mr. Reagan’s policies which are impacting devastatingly on low income and working people. But we know what our powers are within the city of Burlington.

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, during this period you start talking about national issues. You start talking about President Reagan, his economic policy. You start talking about foreign policy. You send letters to the leaders of Japan expressing regret for the two bombs that were dropped on that country by the U.S. What was your thinking? As you’re building this coalition locally, you start talking about issues beyond the borders of Burlington. And what is your thinking —

bernie sanders

Well, let’s be clear. 90 plus percent of our energy was dealing with local issues like reforming the police department and paving the streets. We brought a minor league baseball team into Burlington, Vermont. 95, 98 percent of our work was locally, doing what mayors are supposed to do. But as part of empowering people, what we also believed is it was important to think globally and act locally. So if we were spending a whole lot of money in Washington under Reagan, investing in military spending, or giving tax breaks to the rich, that impacted the city of Burlington. We are mayors, we need money to help us with housing. We need money to help us with roads and infrastructure, and yet Washington is spending this money on the military, or they’re busy invading another country, or whatever they’re doing. We should be speaking up on those issues.

archived recording (bernie sanders) The question is whether we use the incredible wealth and natural resources and intelligence of our society to create a decent standard of living, a decent life for all of our people in this country and abroad, or do we develop the greatest military machine for killing in the history of the world. That’s what the choice is.

bernie sanders

This was in the middle of the Cold War, and we started a sister-city program. I know the, some of the right wing media misinterprets this. But what we did is, I took a group of about a dozen people from Burlington to Yaroslavl in the old Soviet Union.

archived recording [SINGING]

bernie sanders

We had hockey teams coming out, we had doctors coming in and out, we had kids coming in and out. It really — I love the idea of sister-city programs, and it worked phenomenally well.

archived recording [SINGING] This land is your land, this land is my land —

bernie sanders

And it involved a lot of people. So the kids began to learn about Russia, and I happened to believe then, and I believe now, that if we’re going to bring peace to the world, we need a lot of cultural exchanges, we need a lot of youth exchanges. In fact, I recently proposed taking one-tenth of one percent of the military budget and putting it into cultural exchanges, which I think is a very good investment.

archived recording [SINGING] Your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York islands. From the red wood forests — archived recording (bernie sanders) I had an experience this last summer, I was invited by the government of Nicaragua to attend the sixth anniversary of their revolution. And they must have had four or 500,000 people out there listening to speeches, and the horrible thought that I had really sunk my stomach, was that kids in my own city, young kids, working class kids, might be asked by this president to go to Nicaragua to kill and get killed. And it was a horrible thought.

michael barbaro

Some of these endeavors were relatively bold. At a certain point, you go to Nicaragua. You end up meeting with the leader of the Sandinistas. And I — oh, no. I’m not worried about any —

bernie sanders

No, I’m just —

michael barbaro

Oh, you’re worried about time?

bernie sanders

Yeah, we’re running. Yes, we are running — how are we doing on time?

michael barbaro

Five more minutes?

bernie sanders

I think we’re probably going to have to end it right now.

michael barbaro

Oh. No, no, no. This is not a — don’t end it on this question if that’s the issue.

bernie sanders

Well, you know, the issue is —

michael barbaro

Trust me, this is not — all I was going to asking you was, how do events like that connect to voters in Burlington? In your mind —

bernie sanders

Good, absolutely. Very good question. Well, I’ll tell you why —

michael barbaro

How does meeting with an international leader like that —

bernie sanders

I’ll tell you why it does. Because I believe we have to empower people. One of the things we did is, we said to people, speak out on national and international issues. Yes, the mayor of the city of Burlington can’t determine the defense budget. But if we rally people all over the country speaking out on these issues, then the members of Congress and U.S. senators will hear that. So to answer your question, this is just another mechanism that we had to say to people, you have a voice. Do you think we should be spending more money on nuclear weapons? Vote on it. Talk about it. So all of this has to do with empowering people to understand that in a democracy, they can determine the future.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you make of that?

alex burns

That is really the essence of the Bernie Sanders approach to politics, that the most important thing a political leader can do is give voice to people’s deepest concerns and frustrations, and encourage people to give voice to it themselves. And if there is a gap between what that political leader is expressing or channeling, and what he can actually accomplish, it’s almost irrelevant, that the act of expression and engagement is the most important thing. And what happens when you draw people in on an issue like climate change, or the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, is they become politically activated in a way that then transforms politics closer to home at the local level.

michael barbaro

And Sanders did eventually articulate what you’re describing, but not before he got frustrated with me and seemed to indicate he might end the interview when I mentioned Nicaragua. What do you think that that’s about?

alex burns

Well first of all this is a really charged moment in his early career and in American politics. There has been a revolution in Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are a left wing revolutionary movement that overthrows a repressive regime. They are seen as dangerous by the Reagan administration because they are so left wing, and the Republicans in Washington prop up a brutal right wing militia to fight the Sandinistas. Bernie Sanders is one of many Americans on the left who get involved at that point in demonstrating in favor of the Sandinistas, or against Ronald Reagan. Except Sanders takes it considerably further when he actually goes to Nicaragua, shakes hands with Ortega himself. This is a story that someone in Sanders’s position probably ought to be able to explain. Or at least you would think he would feel comfortable explaining it. And what I find somewhat confounding as a reporter is how much he resents even the prompt to go into his thinking at the time and to reflect a little bit on some of the things about his support for the Sandinistas that may not look as justifiable in retrospect. He doesn’t want to do that. My sense is that, at the heart of it for him, is this sense that even asking the question is a kind of red baiting, that it reflects the way the political establishment — and he very much lumps the media in with the political establishment, is out to get him. Much as it was in Burlington, much as he believes it was in the 2016 campaign. This is a guy who in his early days as mayor was described by a fellow elected official as representing the fungus of socialism. He is somebody who is very, very sensitive to anything he perceives as the charge that he is not just a populist, not just very liberal, but this wildly outside the mainstream dangerous radical. And when you raise Nicaragua, I do think that’s the nerve that it hits.

michael barbaro

So that there’s no misunderstanding, those who listen and ask about Nicaragua, I want to give you a chance to make sure that there’s no confusion for any listener who’s casually checking in.

bernie sanders

All right —

michael barbaro

The question is, was there anything about Daniel Ortega that —

bernie sanders

Let me just say this.

michael barbaro

You knew at the time that gave you pause.

bernie sanders

Well, what gave me pause was that the United States at that time, as you may recall. I don’t know, do you remember —

michael barbaro

I was a student.

bernie sanders

Who the president was before Ortega? A dictator named Somoza who was a dictator, a very bad guy supported by the United States of America. Then Ortega came to power, the Sandinistas came to power, and the United States intended to do what it had done in many instances. You are aware the United States has a habit of overthrowing governments in Latin America.

michael barbaro

Yes.

bernie sanders

I didn’t think that was a good idea. Didn’t think it was a good idea then, and I didn’t think it was a good idea now. So we worked against American intervention. So we went there to say, as part of a national movement, that the United States should not be involved.

michael barbaro

Right.

About overthrowing small governments.

michael barbaro

And for the record, in ‘85, were you aware of any human rights issues or abuses by Ortega?

bernie sanders

Well, we were aware that this was a very controversial moment, having taken over from a dictatorship. We were also aware that the United States at that time was supporting many governments in Latin America who were much more brutal than Ortega was.

alex burns

What you hear there is such an evasiveness about assessing the Ortega government on its own merits, that he really wants to talk about his advocacy around Nicaragua exclusively as a repudiation of Reagan, and not as an endorsement of what was going on there. And if you look at his comments and activities at the time, that’s not quite right. He was more explicitly supportive of what the Sandinistas were doing then just going there as a sort of anti-interventionist advocate. But in fairness to Sanders, this was not a fringe position at the time. Support for the Sandinistas has obviously not necessarily aged as well as Bernie Sanders might have expected it to politically, and that’s I think where you hear his real discomfort talking about it in the context of this campaign.

michael barbaro

But in taking this trip and talking about it the way he does, he is living his creed, essentially.

alex burns

Exactly. It is using all the levers of his power and public influence as an elected official to weigh in on this subject that is about as distant, literally, from Burlington as you can get.

As this strategy is being deployed, you’re winning your fourth term as mayor. And you go on, successfully this time, to run for statewide office. The House, the Senate, and then, of course, you run for president 2016, now again in 2020. In each of these campaigns and each of these moments, you’re building larger and more powerful coalitions of voters. And given that history and your success in doing that, what do you think is the big lesson from this early phase? Why do you think it is that when we went to Alex Burns and asked him this question, and he said, you have to go back to ‘81, you have to go back to Burlington to understand Senator Sanders and this campaign and this moment. Why is he right, why do we have to go back to that race and that moment?

bernie sanders

Politics in America has been very much from the top on down. You still read articles in The New York Times where wealthy donors gathered today at a hotel to express concern about the Democratic candidates. Who cares about wealthy donors? We have over 1.1 million Americans who have made donations to our campaign. And they’re not wealthy, these are working class people. They’re teachers, they’re workers at Amazon, they’re workers at Walmart. What I believe then and what I believe now, the way you transform society is from the bottom on up. You talk about issues that are relevant to working people, issues that are relevant to low income people, issues that are relevant to young people, and you grow the voter base. So what I pointed out to you, maybe the most important thing that we did, is from 1979 to 1983, we doubled, doubled the number of people voting. And what we’re trying to do in this campaign right now —

michael barbaro

Is parallel.

bernie sanders

Is to significantly increase the voter turnout by talking to people who don’t vote. In Burlington, what happened is low income and working class people saw that government could work for them. And they said, oh my God, I never knew that. My kids now have a program, we have an after school program they didn’t have. We have a child care center we didn’t have. Our streets are getting paved, snow is getting moved. I didn’t know that — we’re going to go out, we’re going to support Bernie, and we’re going to support the candidates that he wants for Board of Aldermen. And now what we have to do in this country, which has one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on earth, is to reach out to those working people, reach out to those young people. And when they start participating in the political process, that is the political revolution.

michael barbaro

If you become president, the question will be, sure, you talked about national and international issues when you were mayor, but there was no real expectation that you could change the course of events as a single mayor of a town in Burlington. If you become president, that expectation will be real and urgent and present. So are we to understand that if you run into political obstacles as president, that your strategy will be to call upon the expanded electorate that you have created and turned that into a political force that you would then, all of what you did in Burlington with the Board of Aldermen?

bernie sanders

Yes. Well, it’s not an if. That is exactly what is going to happen. When we talk about the need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to every person through a Medicare for all, single-payer program, the only way that’s going to happen is when millions of people stand up and take on the insurance companies and the drug companies. When we talk about transforming our energy system to save the planet from the devastation, absolute devastation of the global crisis regarding climate change, the only way that happens is when millions of people stand up to take on the fossil fuel industry. So on all of the issues we are talking about, that’s what the political revolution is about. It’s saying that we’re going to mobilize millions of people to stand up for an agenda that works for working families. And when they do that, there will be no stopping them. We will be able to create a government and an economy that works for all, not just the one percent.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you think of that theory?

alex burns

Well, the coalition that he’s trying to build as a presidential candidate is such an echo of what he accomplished in Burlington. And his theory is, they are going to show up for him in a way they wouldn’t show up for any other candidate because he is speaking to their concerns directly. And Sanders has plenty of reason to expect that might really be the case. He has charted this remarkable ascent as a national political figure on the strength of this coalition and mainstreamed a set of socialist and quasi-socialist ideas that were seen as really outside the mainstream when he started campaigning on them decades ago, into the center of one of the country’s two major political parties. The question for someone like Bernie Sanders is, does that theory work in a general election on a national scale? Can you really bring in that many new people into the political process where there already are a whole lot of people who vote, and who have pretty vested interests in the context of an American election? Can you speak in the way he does to the concerns of working class people without alienating millions of people who already vote for the Democratic Party, and don’t necessarily share that world view? And could you, as the president, use that exact same playbook, that exact same coalition to master Washington and break a Republican Senate in the same way that he transformed Burlington and broke a city council?

Ms. Nnaemeka seemed confident of the party’s future.

“There are new formations that are aligning. The D.S.A. is growing, and there are all sorts of other insurgent left groups that we are in a deep relationship with,” she said in an interview, referring to the Democratic Socialists of America.

“We were still on an upward trajectory,” she added. “We still delivered on progressive visions even as our party changed shape.”

Bill Lipton, whom Ms. Nnaemeka is replacing, said he would be involved with the state party through the 2020 election, then work on climate issues for the national party.

The W.F.P. and the D.S.A. may not agree on everything. The W.F.P., for example, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary; the Democratic Socialists have endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders.

Democrats Say Yes,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/Elizabeth-Warren-tax-increases.html,"Ms. Warren is making the case that the economy could benefit if money is redistributed from the rich and corporations to uses that she and other liberals say would be more productive. Their argument combines hard data showing that high levels of inequality and wealth concentration weigh down economic growth with a belief that well-targeted government spending can encourage more Americans to work, invest and build skills that would make them more productive.

Fueling their argument is the fact that the United States now has one of the lowest corporate tax burdens among developed nations — a direct result of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Tax revenues at all levels of government in the United States fell to 24.3 percent of the economy last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported on Thursday, down from 26.8 percent in 2017. America is now has the fourth lowest tax burden in all of the O.E.C.D., just above Mexico, Chile and Ireland, a development that Democrats say has helped corporate executives and shareholders get rich but has done little to help working Americans.

In making their pitch, Democrats cite evidence that transferring money to poor and middle-class individuals would increase consumer spending because they spend a larger share of their incomes than wealthy Americans, who tend to save and invest.

“The economy has changed, our understanding of it has changed, and we understand the constricting effects of inequality” on growth, said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality.

Inequality has widened significantly in America over the last several decades. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the incomes of the top 1 percent of Americans more than tripled from 1979 to 2016, before taxes and government transfer payments are taken into account. For the middle class, incomes grew 33 percent. More than a decade after the recession, wage growth for the middle class continues to run well behind previous times of economic expansion, like the late 1990s.

Research by the economist Emmanuel Saez and colleagues shows that the last time such a small sliver of Americans controlled such a large share of the nation’s income and wealth was in the late 1920s, just before a stock market crash set off the Great Depression. World Bank researchers have warned that high levels of inequality are stifling growth in South Africa, which has the globe’s worst measured inequality."

But a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the nation remains in a period of relatively slow growth in health spending.

Health spending in the United States rose by 4.6 percent to $3.6 trillion in 2018 — accounting for 17.7 percent of the economy — compared to a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. Federal officials said the slight acceleration was largely the result of reinstating a tax on health insurers that the Affordable Care Act imposed but Congress had suspended for a year in 2017. Faster growth in medical prices and prescription drug spending were also factors, they said, but comparatively minor.

For decades, national health spending galloped ahead of spending in the overall economy, lowering wages and stressing household budgets. But over the last decade, the pattern has shifted somewhat. Although the country consistently spends more on health care each year than it did the year before, the overall rate of growth has stayed below historical averages. In 2018, health spending grew more slowly than the economy overall, a rare occurrence .

The factors leading to the slowdown are not fully understood. For years, economists thought they were the result of lagging effects of the recession. But as the pattern has continued far into the economic recovery, they increasingly point to changes in the delivery of health care itself."

Then Biden did something embarrassing. As Dr. Jill gestured widely with her arms, the former vice-president took a small nibble on her index finger.

Partisans saw in it what they wanted. To the Sean Hannitys of the world, it was another manifestation of “Crazy Uncle Joe.” Others, including Pete Buttigieg’s senior adviser Lis Smith, saw it as a rare moment of “humanity and affection” in politics.

But as the former vice-president’s support dips in Iowa, his campaign has scheduled an eight-day blitz across 18 counties in an attempt to secure a win in the first state to caucus. It’s a new day for his campaign, and with it comes a new phrase; or, rather, a really old phrase slapped on a new bus.

The slogan isn’t doing any favors for the 77-year-old candidate facing many critics claiming that he is too old for high office. (Though he is one of four septuagenarians in the Democratic primaries running against the 73-year-old incumbent, Biden’s frequent gaffes are pointed to as evidence of his decline as a public speaker.) The use of old-timey Irish-American slang is unlikely to shore up his support among young Hawkeye voters, though it could be a call to his majority in the state: Only 5 percent of Biden’s Iowa supporters are under 45.

Biden has a long history as the only politician to still use the polite, Jazz Age synonym for “bullshit” “Don’t buy all this malarkey that we’re in so much trouble,” he told a crowd in Philadelphia in 1988 in his first run for president. In a vice-presidential debate in 2012, in response to Paul Ryan’s critique over the administration’s handling of the Benghazi attack, Biden said, “With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey.” And in a 2016 speech at the Democratic National Convention, Biden said that Trump’s claims that he “cares about the middle class” are “a bunch of malarkey.” Though it’s probably not the greatest slogan when it requires the dictionary definition of the operative word to be painted on the back of the bus, Biden’s joins a long tradition of corny bus names on the presidential trail, including Ted Cruz’s “Courageous Cruzer,” John Edwards’s “Main Street Express” and “Daddy Worked in a Mill” fleet, and Mitt Romney’s indefensible “Mitt Mobile: A Five Brothers Bus.”

If the eight-day tour was designed to show Biden at his most politically acute, the inaugural event on Saturday could have gone better. As Jill Biden introduced him to a crowd in Council Bluffs, the former vice-president put his wife’s finger in his mouth.

Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky has denied an explicit quid pro quo attaching investigations into President Trump’s political rivals to the release of U.S. military aid. But, in a new interview with Time and several European publications, Zelensky did say that delaying nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was an unfair thing for a “strategic partner” to do.

“Look, I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo,” Zelensky said. “But you have to understand. We’re at war. If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us. I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.”

The denial of a quid pro quo echoes similar statements that Zelensky has made on the subject. During a joint press conference with Trump in New York in September, Zelensky was asked if he “felt any pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?”

“I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections — elections of USA,” he said. Then he insisted that “nobody pushed me.”

Trump quickly seized on those comments in the press conference, jumping in to say, “In other words, no pressure.” He did the same Monday, tweeting this response to the Time interview:

Breaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls. If the Radical Left Democrats were sane, which they are not, it would be case over! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2019

The problem with Trump’s argument is that others have said that there was in fact a quid pro quo, including his own ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. Trump’s also ignoring a key point about Zelensky’s repeated denials. The president of Ukraine has made it clear that he’s not interested in how this scandal plays out in the U.S. He just wants to make sure that his country continues receiving aid. And the surest way to keep the money flowing is to make sure the man in the White House is happy."

The 2020 Democratic presidential field, which added two candidates (Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg) last month, continued its natural “invisible primary” shrinkage as Montana governor Steve Bullock and former representative Joe Sestak withdrew from the race at the end of the Thanksgiving weekend.

Sestak left the contest as he entered it (very late, in June): as more or less an asterisk. He hoped his anti-Establishment persona and strong national-security record (he reached the rank of rear admiral in the Navy) would give him traction. But he raised very little money (under $400,000 in 2019, as of the third quarter), made no real mark in Iowa or other early states, and never threatened to make any debate stage. He came across as a figure from the past, less because of his two unsuccessful Senate campaigns in Pennsylvania than because of seeming like the relic of an era when Democrats pined incessantly for candidates with a military background.

Bullock, a sitting two-term governor from deep-red Montana with a reasonably progressive record, was a different matter. On paper, he had a strong electability argument in a cycle when Democratic voters were obsessed with electability, and as the presidential field first formed, he had some serious street cred. But he fatally alienated many insiders by refusing to enter the contest until his state’s legislative session ended in May. He missed the first debate in June, then had his one shot at a breakout moment in the July 30 debate in Detroit. As my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti explained at the time, expectations for Bullock were high going into that event:

For months now — and, in some cases, years — a handful of senior Democrats have been whispering to donors, activists, strategists, and pundits that they should take a serious look at Montana governor Steve Bullock. Here’s a guy who’s actually won a statewide race deep in Trump Country, an anti-dark-money crusader with a solid liberal record, who could be the non–Joe Biden folksy sorta-centrist voters might be looking for, they said.

Unfortunately, the most memorable Bullock moment in that debate was his argument with Elizabeth Warren about her proposed no-first-use-of-nuclear-weapons position. Appearing determined to keep a preemptive U.S. nuclear strike on the table was not a great look for today’s Democratic Party:

[A]s the evening wound down, his exchange with Warren over nuclear policy highlighted the sheer scale of the task he still has ahead of him. And it reminded his advocates that this world probably isn’t the one of their wistful musings.

And it was John Delaney, not Bullock, who succeeded in hogging attention as the non-Biden-centrist in the race by going after Sanders and Warren repeatedly. That was the last time Bullock appeared in a candidate debate.

He managed to pull in $2.3 million in third-quarter fundraising, enough to run a couple of TV ads in Iowa, the main focus of his campaign. And for his fans there was one thrilling moment when an Emerson poll of that state in October showed him suddenly holding 4 percent of the vote (good for sixth place, ahead of such worthies as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker). But subsequent surveys were deeply discouraging, particularly the gold-standard Selzer poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom in November, which gave Bullock less than one-half of one percent alongside a pallid

24–26 favorability ratio. Whatever Bullock was selling, Iowa caucusgoers weren’t buying it.

One problem Bullock had among the party insiders who were his strongest constituency was the intense desire many harbored that in the end he would emulate John Hickenlooper by dropping out and instead running for the Senate (in his case, against Republican senator Steve Daines). Like Hickenlooper initially, Bullock has long maintained he’s not interested in becoming a senator, as Vox reported in August:

Bullock has repeatedly — and emphatically — said he doesn’t want the job.

Montana’s Senate seat “has never in his life, not once, been a consideration,” Bullock campaign senior adviser Matt McKenna told Vox. “There’s just no way.”

He repeated that demurral as he withdrew from the presidential contest. Buy cynics–or optimists, depending on how you look at it–will point out that Montana’s filing deadline for the Senate race isn’t until next March. Still, it’s more likely that Bullock will quietly end his term as governor next year and consider his options. He’s relatively young at 53. And if Democrats lose to Trump in 2020, Bullock will still be around, still possessing a sterling political record (if you overlook this misfired presidential bid) and his electability argument as his party sorts through the wreckage and looks for salvation."

There are simply not enough stuffing-centric holidays on the calendar, and this is The Trailer.

Joe Biden speaks at a send-off rally for his ""No Malarkey!"" campaign bus tour in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Saturday. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)

DENISON, Iowa — The first stops of Joe Biden's ""No Malarkey!"" bus tour were busy, lively and not too crowded. Around 150 people came to kick off the tour in Council Bluffs, where an early November visit from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) had drawn 2,400.

Around 80 Iowans came to see Biden in Denison, fewer than attended a town hall with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg last week. When Biden made a surprise stop at a firehouse — the International Association of Fire Fighters was the first union to support him — just three firefighters were there to accept his gift of doughnuts. (The others were on call.)

That was fine. Other candidates could draw flashy crowds. Biden, as his supporters liked to explain, could win.

""Think about more than whom you like, or who best aligns with your political thinking,"" said former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack, as she introduced the candidate in Denison. ""I hope you'll think about the people who won't or can't participate in the caucuses but who will vote in the general election. I hope you'll think about the people in the middle, because those are the people who will decide the 2020 election.""

After nearly a year of campaigning, two months of it counterprogrammed against House impeachment hearings, the race for Iowa has become less about Democrats' own preferences and more what they imagine voters in the upper Midwest like. Both Biden and Buttigieg describe an electorate that is clearly ready to reject President Trump, so long as Democrats don't threaten to change too much about the country.

For much of the year, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) channeled Democratic frustration about the 2016 campaign into similar arguments: Democrats would win with transformational ideas, exciting the voters who had stopped trusting politicians. Biden's theory, and Buttigieg's, is that voters simply want to stop having to think so much about the president.

""I think character is literally on the ballot,"" Biden said in Denison. ""For Democrats, Republicans, independents: It's character. Is this person decent? Do they share my basic fundamental values? Do they understand that everybody deserves an even chance? Are they going to be straight with me? Are they authentic?""

Biden's tour, which will stretch through next weekend — he is taking just two pauses for fundraisers — is as focused on the ""electability"" question as anything he's done. Over the first day, he spent most of his time on two topics, the unfitness of the president (""our children are listening"") and his plan for rural America. Every Democrat who's competitive in Iowa has a rural plan, and in some ways, Biden's is less expansive; he sets aside $20 billion for rural broadband, for example, to $80 billion from Buttigieg and $85 billion from Warren. But Biden, unlike them, had helped pass big spending bills, so Biden, unlike them, could sketch out a future that looked comfortably like the past.

""The chances aren't being equally accessible to people these days,"" Biden said in Denison. ""If I become your president, that's going to be my focus. My focus is on why America was built the nation it was the first place. If the middle class does well, people are going to stay where they were raised.""

This wasn't too different from the pitch Hillary Clinton made to Iowans in 2016; she had promised a ""broadband-for-all"" investment that would get rural America fully wired by 2021. Iowa Democrats often say they're for more ambitious plans, too. Medicare-for-all remains, marginally, the most popular health insurance plan among caucus-goers, ahead of a ""public option."" It's the same for free tuition at public colleges and universities, and the same for the ""Green New Deal.""

The problem for supporters of those policies is that many Iowa Democrats worry Republican or independent voters won't agree with them. In those some Iowa polls, roughly a third of Democrats who support more left-wing policies suggest that candidates who support them are less electable. Gordon Reed, 64, who had caucused for Sanders in 2016, said that he had gotten behind Biden while deciding that Sanders, or Warren, could not win key states in a general election.

""Their policies bankrupt our government,"" Reed said in Denison. ""We don't have the money for it. I love their passion. I love their willingness to say what they want. But pragmatism has to win out. If I want a rib-eye steak, but I only have money for a hamburger, do I starve to death? Or do I buy the hamburger?""

The left's growing clout inside the Democratic Party, which has dramatically changed the party's default positions on health care, labor and abortion rights, has given Biden and Buttigieg ways to pitch their appeal to independents and Republicans. Both use populist rhetoric to explain why voters aren't ready for too much populism — why, instead, they want less political strife. After months of TV ads, even voters listening to rival candidates sometimes praise Buttigieg's fight-free vision of ""Medicare-for-all-who-want-it,"" a swerve away from the complicated Medicare-for-all debate.

For Biden, it's his riff on how ""Wall Street didn't build this country,"" which is disconnected from any other criticism of the financial industry and avoids Warren's and Sanders's call-outs of individual chief executives. (He has talked about repealing the 2017 tax cuts, which benefited the industry.) For Buttigieg, it's a series of arguments about how well-meaning left-wing ideas could alienate voters, warning (not always subtly) that candidates focused on ""fighting"" will just leave the country divided and the next president's agenda unfinished.

""We can gather the majority to drive those big ideas through without turning off half the country before we even get into office,"" Buttigieg says in his most recent Iowa ad; it deploys a populist argument against benefits for ""millionaires and billionaires"" to argue against universal free public college.

Buttigieg's college plan is actually more conservative than one Clinton rolled out during the 2016 campaign. Hers made public college free for families earning under $125,000 per year; for Buttigieg, the cutoff is $100,000. And Buttigieg's plan infuriated left-wing Democrats, who saw him trying to turn their own voters against a concept, ""college for all,"" that had been gaining steam.

""This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems,"" tweeted Ocasio-Cortez, after Buttigieg's ad went viral.

Biden, whose own advertising has not slighted other Democrats, has a deeper reserve of Democratic goodwill. That was on display as his tour began. A brief moment in Council Bluffs, where Biden's wife Jill accidentally clipped him with her hand and he jokingly bit her finger, went nuclear on conservative media; it got a warm laugh from the Bidens' hot-chocolate-sipping crowd. At every stop, Biden carved out time for conversations with voters, signing autographs or calling family members. When the interactions were over, volunteers materialized with clipboards, asking for help on caucus day. There is no flash, which is the point: Biden is the candidate voters know, which is why they know he can win.

""If you look at the polls in the states that really will decide who the next president will be, whether it's Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin, here, Florida, Ohio, there's one constant,"" said former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack on Saturday night, closing out Biden's first day on the bus. ""Joe Biden is doing better against Donald Trump than any other Democratic candidate. In fact, in almost all of those states, Joe Biden is beating the president by a considerable margin. So, that tells me this is the only thing, probably, that Donald Trump and I agree on. Joe Biden is the one that he's most concerned about.""

DEMS IN DISARRAY

The Working Families Party is a strange political specimen: It runs its own candidates, it commands its own ballot line, but it does not ""spoil"" elections for Democrats. That's because the party grew out of New York politics, where ""fusion voting"" allows candidates to run with the backing of multiple parties. While it has elected a few people on its own ballot line, it has pointedly declined to challenge Democrats even after bitter fights. Last year, after Cynthia Nixon fell short in her Democratic challenge to New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the WFP voted to drop Nixon from its ballot line and support Cuomo.

The party's reward: potential oblivion. As part of negotiations over the state's new electoral rules, state Democrats proposed raising the requirement for ballot access in a way that would hurt the left-wing party in particular. Currently, any New York political party must petition to make the ballot or get at least 50,000 votes for a statewide candidate to stay on automatically. State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, a member of the electoral reform coalition, now favors raising the requirement to 2 percent of total votes cast every two years, or 130,000 total votes, whichever is higher in the given year. If implemented now, that would strike the WFP from the ballot, along with every New York third party save for the Conservative Party.

“Governor Cuomo and Jay Jacobs were hellbent on punishing the WFP for our independence,"" New York Working Families Party Director Bill Lipton said in a statement. ""This is a power grab by the Governor and his allies to consolidate power and weaken independent progressive political organizing. The result is that New York will be the most hostile state in America to minor parties — if the changes hold up to legal scrutiny.""

There is virtually no outside support for the rule change. Elizabeth Warren, who won the national WFP endorsement this summer, has condemned the proposal, as has one of the city's major newspapers. ""Make it 100,000 and make it fair,"" wrote the editorial board of the New York Daily News, endorsing a change that would keep the WFP's ballot status. Even Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a sometimes target (but occasional ally) of the party, urged the commission to leave fusion voting in place and protect the WFP. If the rule is approved, it could hobble one of the faster-growing forces in left-wing politics, with repercussions for 2020.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, ""Big Ideas."" The ad that launched a thousand tweets, only some of them in Iowa. Buttigieg's latest velvet-gloved spot, one in a series in which he's contrasted more expansive Democratic plans with his own. ""There are some voices that say, 'Well, that doesn't count unless you go even further, unless it's free even for the kids of billionaires,'"" Buttigieg tells his audience. ""But I only want to make promises we can keep.""

United We Win, ""The Other Rhodes Scholar."" The second super PAC created to boost Cory Booker's campaign (he's tried and failed to wave them off) captures the zeitgeist in Iowa, assuming that its audience is already in love with Pete Buttigieg. ""He's a Rhodes scholar, a successful mayor, a uniter,"" says a narrator, before a jagged jump cut to Booker, whose own achievements have been getting some free media lately. It's the most negative ad ever run against Buttigieg as a presidential candidate, and it's not even that negative; it just suggests that Booker is better. (The ad also describes Newark's schools as ""number one for beating the odds,"" a superlative unbound by data.)

Cory Booker, ""Love."" The senator’s first ad in Iowa, coming less than two weeks before the qualifying deadline for December’s debate, is a quick run through of his inspirational stump speech: “From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, the truth of America is that we win when we come together and show the best of who we are against the worst that we face.” It could not be less like the super PAC ad, which is usually how these things work; third-party groups go negative where campaigns go positive. But again, Booker's said he does not want that PAC helping him.

One of the big questions (if not quite mysteries) of the primary last month was ""What happened to Elizabeth Warren?"" CNN's polling complicates one theory, that the pressure put on Warren in October's debate began moving voters away from her. Voters thought that Warren came off best that night; after November's debate, in which Warren was never attacked effectively, voters were more impressed by Buttigieg. It's tempting to find single causes for campaign's triumphs or struggles, but the damage to Warren looks more iterative.

The Democratic primary field shrunk again Sunday, with former Navy admiral and congressman Joe Sestak quitting the race and citing a lack of media coverage.

“Without the benefit of national press,” Sestak said in a statement, “it is unfair to ask others to husband their resolve and to sacrifice resources.”

Joe Biden. He got another congressional endorsement on Saturday: Rep. John Garamendi, a fixture of California politics and former lieutenant governor. ""The support that Joe Biden has received from within the state is well-deserved and characteristic of the broad coalition he has built,"" Garamendi said in a statement.

Elizabeth Warren. Before her Saturday town hall in Chicago, she got the support of Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a former leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; that particular pool of Democrats has been splitting between Warren and Sanders.

Pete Buttigieg. He spent Sunday at the Rev. William Barber's church in North Carolina before heading to South Carolina.

Cory Booker. On CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, he made another plea for support to make the next debate. ""If you want me in this race, if you want my voice and message, which is resonating, then I need help,"" Booker said. ""I am running on individual contributions and that’s what we are going to need to keep going.” Booker has enough individual donations to qualify for the debate but needs four qualifying polls (or two from early states).

Bernie Sanders. He made a return appearance on NBC’s “The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon;” on Sunday he made a run through South Carolina, speaking at a church and hosting an afternoon “eat and greet” for voters. ""It is not justice when so few have so much, and so many have so little,"" Sanders said at the service. ""Justice says that black women should not die in childbirth at three times the rate as white women.""

Kamala D. Harris. She returned to Iowa over Thanksgiving week for house parties, the focus of her rebooted caucus-centric campaign; she also began running a new digital spot.

Julián Castro. He's returning to California this week for more of the movements-first campaigning he's focused on; a homelessness roundtable, a Los Angeles news conference ""calling for accountability for the officers involved in the shooting of Grechario Mack,"" and finally a foreign policy speech at Stanford, his alma mater.

Cory Booker. On CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" he made another plea for support before the cutoff for the next debate.""If you want me in this race if you want my voice and message, which is resonating then I need help,” Booker said, asking supporters to contribute to his campaign. “I am not taking corporate PAC money. … I am running on individual contributions and that’s what we are going to need to keep going.”

Tom Steyer. He's spent the weekend in the Las Vegas area, from an ""anti-corruption roundtable"" to a women's luncheon to a meet-and-greet in little-visited Pahrump.

Marianne Williamson. She spent the weekend in Iowa, culminating in a World AIDS Day Event in Iowa City on Sunday night.

Andrew Yang. He's returning to New Hampshire this week and heading back to Iowa for a bus tour at the middle of the month; his campaign announced that it had its biggest fundraising day on Saturday, pulling in almost $750,000.

Tulsi Gabbard. For at least the second time, she's accused the Democratic National Committee of unfairly slanting debate access against her by not counting as a qualifier the Boston Globe/Suffolk poll, which found her at 6 percent support in New Hampshire. ""The pollster the Globe uses is recognized by the DNC for other media outlets,"" Gabbard said in a statement while campaigning in the Granite State. ""There is no reason the DNC should not recognize this Boston Globe poll, other than adherence to a subjective, nontransparent process where party elites try to dictate to the primary voters."" Gabbard needs just one more qualifying poll to access the December debate, but from the moment the party set its rules, the Globe/Suffolk poll was excluded.

ON THE TRAIL

Buttigieg and Warren at the debate last month. (John Bazemore/AP)

WATERLOO, Iowa — In the waning days before Thanksgiving, two of the top contenders in Iowa got into a long-distance argument about transparency and ethics. They broke for the holiday before a lot of people noticed.

It began, sort of, on the day of the fifth Democratic debate. Buttigieg released tax returns from his time at the McKinsey consulting firm in 2007 and 2008, records he’d held on to during his two campaigns for mayor. He’d fulfilled a campaign promise, having told The Washington Post to expect the records before the Iowa caucuses, and he issued a challenge: “Every candidate in this race should be transparent with voters by disclosing their income in the private and public sectors.""

Only one of Buttigieg’s close competitors did any private-sector work of consequence: Elizabeth Warren. She’d released her tax returns from 2008 onward, starting with her service in the congressional panel overseeing TARP. But that was as far back as she went. For years before that, Warren was paid for legal advice in 56 cases, as disclosed by her campaign this summer.

""You've got to be prepared to lead by example on transparency,"" Buttigieg told reporters in Denison, Iowa. ""And that does mean disclosing your tax returns from both public and private sector work experience.""

Warren blew it off. ""I think anyone who runs for president should have to meet the same rule [as Barack Obama], and that would be the eight-year rule,"" she told reporters in West Des Moines. ""I’m already well past that.” She then turned the topic back to Buttigieg: ""There are some candidates who want to distract from the fact that they have not released the names of their clients and have not released the names of their bundlers.""

That statement applied only to Buttigieg, who, pressed on it, said that Warren was ""changing the subject,"" then rebuffed a CNN reporter who asked if he'd open his fundraisers to the press.

Both topics were pretty far from the center of Democratic primary debates. Joe Biden is the only Democrat who's holding traditional fundraisers who has allowed reporters into them; Warren's tax returns would reveal whether she was paid for additional legal work, but that work hasn't become a primary flash point.

By Sunday, when Warren returned to this small Iowa city, the issue had already burned out. She took questions instead about Buttigieg's newest criticism: that if free public college was not means-tested, it would benefit the children of millionaires and billionaires. Without repeating back his name, she disagreed: ""I think it's the right thing to do.""

Cipollone’s letter, like many documents produced by the president’s private lawyers and government lawyers alike, is written in a Trumpian tone, full of preposterous assertions and childish whining, as though the authors were laboring to channel the president’s distinctive rhetorical style. Its central argument is that the president’s rights have been violated, citing “the complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness afforded the President throughout this purported impeachment inquiry.”

Purported? I’d invite any criminal defendant to walk into court and proclaim, “I refuse to participate in this purported trial!” and see how that works out for them.

Of course, impeachment is not precisely like a criminal proceeding, though it has some parallels. In particular, this phase of the process is where the president has the opportunity to mount his own defense. Yet it appears he may choose not to.

Which isn’t all that surprising, because at this point it’s hard to see what brilliant defense Trump might have up his sleeve. In the Intelligence Committee hearings, we saw what the Republican defense of Trump would look like. They had an opportunity for their counsel to cross-examine witnesses at length. They had Republican members present their best arguments for Trump’s innocence. They had Rep. Jim Jordan do his exasperated-shouting routine. They had Rep. Devin Nunes deliver speeches mixing bizarre claims with debunked conspiracy theories. They gave it everything they had.

AD

AD

And what did it amount to? Did they puncture any of the claims against the president? Did they show the witnesses to be liars conspiring against him? Did they produce dramatic new evidence showing that in fact everything Trump did was to serve not his own interests but those of the country?

No, they did not. So if given every bit of “due process” they could want, what would they come up with now? Are there fact witnesses who can prove Trump’s innocence who have to this point been silent? Who might that be? They can call Hunter Biden in to yell at him for a few hours, but what will that change about what Trump did?

Let’s not forget how clear and unambiguous the case for Trump’s wrongdoing is. We have the rough transcript of his phone call with President Zelensky, in which he responds to Zelensky’s expressed desire for military aid by urging him to investigate Joe Biden. We have Trump’s own statement on the White House lawn, when asked what he wanted from Ukraine: “It’s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens.” We have the acting chief of staff’s statement that yes, there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine, and we all need to “get over it.”

AD

AD

We have the testimony of witness after witness from within the Trump administration, explaining how the president turned over Ukraine policy to Rudy Giuliani, who has been publicly vocal about pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden to help Trump’s reelection. We have lengthy testimony on how important it was to Giuliani and Trump that the Ukrainians make a public show of launching such an investigation.

There are a couple of ways Republicans can spin all those facts. They can argue, as they now appear to be doing, that while Trump did everything he is accused of, all his actions were in fact just peachy. Or they can admit, as a few have, that while it wasn’t appropriate to do what Trump did, but then say his misdeeds don’t rise to the level of impeachment and removal.

But you don’t need a bunch of White House lawyers to do that. The minority members of the Judiciary Committee (among them such intellectual heavyweights as Jordan, Texas’s Louie Gohmert and Florida’s Matt Gaetz) are perfectly capable of yelling at witnesses to produce clips to replay on the evening’s episode of “Hannity.” That’s all the defense Trump wants or needs.

AD

AD

As any parent knows, children between the ages of about 3 and 7 will cry “Unfair!” whenever anything doesn’t go their way. The president seems never to have progressed beyond that stage of development, and so his White House has adopted that cry as their strategy for dealing with impeachment. As long as all they want is to keep the Fox News audience loyal to him, and thereby keep Republicans in Congress too afraid to cross the party’s base despite the facts, it’s a strategy that could work.

“There is also nothing wrong with asking serious questions about the presence of Vice President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, on the board of directors of Burisma, a corrupt Ukrainian company, or about Ukraine’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Biden’s Burisma has an international reputation as a corrupt company. As far back as 2015, the Obama State Department had concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board.”

AD

AD

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this report is that, in its 123 pages, it makes almost no mention of the conspiracy theory that Trump actually broached on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: that the elder Biden was seeking to help his son by removing a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.

The above paragraph, from the introductory summary, is a great example. It pretends Trump was really just asking questions about Burisma. And that’s a common thread through the report.

Indeed, the one example I could find of a reference to the former vice president’s actions is here, and it doesn’t even ascribe the theory to Trump:

AD

In addition to Burisma, there are questions about why the Ukrainian government fired then-Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin — according to Vice President Biden, at his insistence — when it did not fire his successor, Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko. Although Shokin and Lutsenko were both seen by State Department officials as corrupt and ineffective prosecutors, there was no effort to remove Lutsenko to the same degree or in the same way as there was with Shokin.

To be clear, Trump said on his call with Zelensky, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

AD

Trump doesn’t even raise a concern about Burisma’s alleged corruption; he’s interested only in Joe Biden’s actions.

The report makes almost no effort to vouch for the latter — apparently because it would be clear that Trump was trying to damage his potential 2020 opponent. The report, at several other points, argues that there is no evidence that Trump was trying to help himself win reelection, against all logic.

AD

“The evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats’ witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor.”

The witnesses thus far were “fact witnesses” — not experts in criminal law. What’s more, many of them said explicitly that they weren’t there to make legal judgments or weigh in for or against impeachment.

AD

“I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other,” the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., testified, “or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them about the incidents in question as well as my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States.”

AD

At one point, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) asked Taylor and top State Department official George Kent, “Where is the impeachable offense in that call? Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?”

Taylor reminded Ratcliffe that he wasn’t there to make such determinations, and Ratcliffe withdrew the question. Apparently the GOP isn’t withdrawing the argument, though.

AD

“Understood in this proper context, the president’s initial hesitation to meet with President Zelensky or to provide U.S. taxpayer-funded security assistance to Ukraine without thoughtful review is entirely prudent.”

The argument has long been that Ukraine is indeed a corrupt country, so why not hold off on making concessions until we can ensure things are headed in the right direction?

AD

But even if we ignore the fact that the only investigations Trump has asked for are ones that carry personal benefits for him, there’s also this: There already was a “thoughtful review” of Ukraine’s anti-corruption measures, and Ukraine passed it. It came from the Defense Department, which concluded in May that Ukraine had made sufficient progress on corruption to merit the aid. And even after Trump held up the funds, it’s not clear that any official review took place.

AD

What’s more, if this was the true reason for the hold, nobody seemed to want to say it, including within the Trump administration, for reasons that simply aren’t clear.

“President Trump then released security assistance to Ukraine and met with President Zelensky in September 2019 — all without Ukraine taking any action to investigate President Trump’s political rival. … The Democrats’ impeachment narrative ignores Ukraine’s dramatic transformation in its fight against endemic corruption. President Trump was skeptical of Ukrainian corruption and his Administration sought proof that newly-elected President Zelensky was a true reformer. And after winning a parliamentary majority, the new Zelensky administration took rapid strides to crack down on corruption. Several high-level U.S. officials observed firsthand these anticorruption achievements in Kyiv, and the security assistance was released soon afterward.”

AD

First of all, it’s true that Trump met with Zelensky — but only at the United Nations and not at the White House, as Zelensky had sought.

AD

What’s more, both that and the release of the military aid came after the scandal began emerging in public — and, in the case of the military aid, after Trump was getting bipartisan pressure to release it.

Whether Trump actually did something impeachable is a valid question about which people can disagree, but the idea that Trump giving Zelensky what he wanted means this was all on the up-and-up doesn’t really make sense. If a bank robber gives up on his plot because he sees the police coming, does that mean he didn’t try to rob the bank?

This week, the House Judiciary Committee will move toward drafting articles of impeachment after the Intelligence Committee releases its own report on Trump’s corrupt efforts to extort Ukraine into announcing investigations to benefit his reelection campaign.

AD

AD

The first argument came from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.) on “Fox News Sunday.” Chris Wallace pushed Collins on whether he saw it as a problem that Trump conditioned official acts — whether a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid — on announcing investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden:

.@RepDougCollins's explanation for why he doesn't think Trump did anything wrong w/ Ukraine is one of the most epic word salads ever served: ""There was nothing about a problematic giving aid to another country in which you're talking about corruption, which you're required to do"" pic.twitter.com/UvMGpOEFEk — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 1, 2019

Collins claimed there was “nothing problematic” about conditioning aid on Ukraine rooting out “corruption.” He then said in the very next breath that it “just so happened” that the corruption in question involved Hunter Biden, insisting that “other witnesses” also said Hunter’s arrangement with the Ukrainian company Burisma was questionable.

As Will Saletan notes, no witness said this. But the crucial point here is that Collins has adopted the position that there was nothing wrong with demanding this investigation, because it was just pure coincidence that the corruption in question (which is entirely fabricated) involved a chief 2020 rival.

AD

AD

The idea that Trump was focused on generic corruption is falsifiable: Trump aides and allies have privately and publicly conceded it’s bunk, and on his call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump explicitly called only for investigations that would help him politically. Whatever Collins actually believes about Trump’s motives, what’s staring us in the face is that Collins is arguing that what Trump actually did do is just fine.

Senator Kennedy’s laughable spin

We also saw this from Sen. John Kennedy (La.), who said on NBC News: “I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.” Kennedy continued that Trump should be allowed to present evidence to this effect, in keeping with his “demonstrated record fighting foreign corruption.”

AD

The notion that Ukraine interfered in 2016 is based on a series of occurrences (which Kennedy alluded to) that have been wildly distorted beyond any connection with reality. As Glenn Kessler details, it’s based on “flotsam and jetsam” that has nothing whatsoever in common with the state-level interference alleged.

AD

But the point here is that Kennedy is saying not just that this interference happened but also that it justified Trump’s demand for investigations to get to the bottom of it as part of his efforts to fight “foreign corruption.”

Senate Republicans will advance this argument at Trump’s impeachment trial: Trump understandably concluded he’d been victimized by a Ukrainian plot; therefore, Trump’s demand for Zelensky to “investigate” it was entirely justified.

AD

But they will be doing this after intelligence officials privately warned them this theory has been Russian propaganda for years. That’s because it’s supposed to help absolve Russia of sabotaging the 2016 election for Trump (which will also absolve his campaign of efforts to coordinate with and benefit from it).

Indeed, this is what gives the theory its political utility for Trump. Here again, the argument requires you to believe this demand for an investigation into “corruption” would also help him politically by pure coincidence.

AD

But putting aside how laughable that is, we’re once again left with this: Republicans are arguing that Trump’s pressure on Zelensky was absolutely fine.

AD

The actual GOP position

On both these fronts, Republicans are entirely unperturbed by Trump’s use of his office to solicit foreign interference in the next election on his behalf. They absurdly claim influencing the election wasn’t the motive, but that actually underscores the point: They have largely adopted the posture that making these demands of Zelensky was justified — that it was the correct thing to do.

In an alternate universe in which reporters and commentators fully reckoned with this state of affairs, any process objections would be immediately dismissed as pure bad faith and misdirection rather than being treated as one of two competing but equivalently legitimate and sincerely felt arguments in a conventional political skirmish.

AD

AD

One can envision some Republicans sincerely believing Trump’s conduct was justifiable while also harboring sincere process objections. But accepting this requires extensive denial about the spectacular bad faith we’ve already seen, from the up-is-down inversion of witness claims into their diametric opposites, to the reflexive reversion to conspiracy theories hermetically sealed off from factual penetration entirely.

Indeed, as Jay Rosen notes, the familiar lament that the two sides can’t agree on common facts is itself distortive. It obscures the degree to which Republicans are employing their various claims — about process and substance alike — in purely instrumental ways.

The New York Times gets at this bluntly:

AD

Republicans … want to mire Democrats in a sloppy fight, making the hearings into such a confusing mishmash of competing information that even Republicans troubled by Mr. Trump’s actions see no upside in breaking with him.

Republicans have made up their minds: Trump did no wrong. The process objections lay the groundwork to create the impression that if few or no Republican minds end up getting changed, it’s because the case against Trump was mishandled and not because changing Republican minds was never possible.

AD

No one who aspires to the faithful representation of these events is required to pretend otherwise.

His last comment, offered after the last two witnesses testified, was similarly dismissive of Trump’s guilt.

“What you’re seeing in this room over the past two weeks is a show trial,” said Nunes (R-Calif.), “the planned result of three years of political operations and dirty tricks, campaigns waged against this president. And like any good show trial, the verdict was decided before the trial ever began.”

AD

AD

On Monday, The Washington Post obtained a 123-page document drafted by Nunes and other senior House Republicans that offers a rebuttal to the expected report from the Democratic majority. The thrust of the document is that Trump’s interactions with Ukraine were aboveboard and understandable, an outgrowth of his demonstrated commitments and concerns that suggested no ulterior motives — and, indeed, that no such motives were shown. It is, in essence, a formalized, more tonally neutral version of the argument that Nunes offered repeatedly from the dais — and one that is often at odds with the testimony that Nunes and his colleagues heard.

The document delineates 10 findings to exonerate Trump. They are listed in bold below, followed by our analysis of how robust an argument can be made for them.

“President Trump has a deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption.”

AD

AD

On May 23, a small group of officials met with Trump at the White House after having attended Zelensky’s inauguration several days prior. The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, testified that the group hoped to convey to Trump its confidence that Zelensky would tackle endemic corruption in the country.

“Unfortunately,” Sondland told the committee, “President Trump was skeptical. He expressed concerns that the Ukrainian government was not serious about reform, and he even mentioned that Ukraine tried to take him down in the last election.”

By this point, Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani had already publicly and repeatedly criticized alleged Ukrainian corruption, focused on two issues that quickly became central to Trump’s own beliefs. The first was the “tried to take him down” claim, a vague reference to the unfounded idea that Ukraine had tried to interfere in the 2016 election against Trump. The other was Giuliani’s belief that former vice president Joe Biden had demanded the firing of a prosecutor investigating a company, Burisma Holdings, for which Biden’s son Hunter worked. The primary source for Giuliani’s belief? The fired prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was targeted by Biden and others within the Obama administration and internationally for failing to act on corruption.

AD

AD

The Republican report notes that Giuliani was probably a source of Trump’s skepticism.

As we’ve reported, if Trump had a “deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism” of corruption in Ukraine, he never mentioned it before the emergence of his interactions with Zelensky in September. He talked about corruption all the time — in the context of Democrats and the media. Trump has never indicated a real interest in combating international corruption as president.

We have documentation of three times when Trump and Zelensky spoke directly: The April 21 call after Zelensky won the election, the July 25 call mentioned above and a Sept. 25 public press availability with the two presidents in New York.

AD

In none of those conversations did Trump address corruption in any context except wanting an investigation of the Bidens specifically.

AD

“President Trump has a long-held skepticism of U.S. foreign assistance and believes that Europe should pay its fair share for mutual defense.”

It is true that Trump has frequently complained about foreign aid and that he has at times ordered that aid be reduced or halted. It’s similarly true that he has advocated that Europe contribute more to NATO, though that’s generally an apparent misunderstanding of the benchmark requirement of NATO members, which focuses on defense spending as a function of GDP and not actual contributions to the organization.

AD

What’s important to remember in this case, though, is that there was no explanation communicated within the administration for the stoppage of aid to Ukraine. Trump was apparently alerted to the aid after the Defense Department publicly announced military assistance in late June (according to Mark Sandy of the Office of Management and Budget). By July 3, multiple administration officials were aware that a hold had been placed on the aid, a halt communicated more broadly on July 18. Ukraine was aware of the halt as early as July 25 — the day of the Trump-Zelensky call.

AD

More importantly: If the aid was halted by Trump simply because he didn’t like foreign aid, that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t then used to pressure Ukraine.

“President Trump’s concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board are valid. The Obama State Department noted concerns about Hunter Biden’s relationship with Burisma in 2015 and 2016.”

AD

There is little dispute that Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board as his father served as vice president was potentially problematic.

However, this isn’t what Trump expressed. In the July 25 call, he described his desire for an investigation as follows:

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

This is not a “concern about Hunter Biden’s role.” This is Trump lifting up the allegation made by Shokin (and rebutted by numerous other officials) that he was fired because Joe Biden acted inappropriately. There is no question raised by Trump about Hunter Biden and no investigation of Hunter Biden requested. The focus is only on Joe Biden, a potential 2020 opponent of Trump’s.

AD

“There is indisputable evidence that senior Ukrainian government officials opposed President Trump’s candidacy in the 2016 election and did so publicly. It has been publicly reported that a Democratic National Committee operative worked with Ukrainian officials, including the Ukrainian Embassy, to dig up dirt on then-candidate Trump.”

AD

These claims are extraneous to the issue at hand, which focuses on Trump’s own actions. They are, instead, an attempt to rationalize what Trump did, just as the above claims about Hunter Biden are meant to offer an argument for why Trump might have wanted an investigation of the former vice president’s son.

In this case, though, the evidence for the claims themselves is even less defensible. We reported on this at length on Monday, articulating the claims above and assessing the evidence behind them. In short, two or three senior officials disparaged Trump on social media, something that former Trump National Security Council official Fiona Hill testified was common among officials of numerous countries, including close U.S. allies. The “operative” who worked to “dig up dirt” was, in fact, a DNC consultant in charge of outreach who investigated the Trump campaign chairman’s political work in Ukraine on the side. It was reportedly an effort to see whether Paul Manafort’s hands were dirty, not Trump’s — and Manafort’s hands turned out to be demonstrably dirty, leading to his resignation from the campaign.

AD

Comparing this to Russia’s 2016 interference is ridiculous. Politico reported Monday afternoon that Senate Republicans who looked at the question agreed.

AD

“The evidence does not establish that President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election for the purpose of benefiting him in the 2020 election.”

The evidence — the rough transcript of the July 25 call — clearly demonstrates that Trump pressured Ukraine to launch two investigations, one about Joe Biden’s targeting of Shokin and one focused on a false theory that Ukraine was somehow involved in inaccurately blaming Russia for culpability in hacking the DNC in 2016. Others in the administration went further, pushing for a broader 2016 probe or of Burisma itself.

AD

The question of pressure itself is well established. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a member of the NSC, noted the inherent imbalance between the United States and Ukraine that underlines any request from the American president. David Holmes, a staffer at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, outlined how Ukraine felt — and still feels — pressure to comply with Trump’s requests.

Were the requests meant to benefit Trump in the 2020 election? That is harder to evaluate, in part because it depends on understanding his motivation.

We can focus on the specific requests being made: to probe Joe Biden in particular and to cast doubt on a central component of Russia’s 2016 interference (the DNC hacking). Were Ukraine to announce investigations that might have those results, the political benefit to Trump would be tangible, but the effects on Trump’s purported actual concerns — corruption and 2016 interference by Ukraine — negligible. Republicans have inserted Trump’s specific requests into a broader, more nebulous context precisely so that they can dismiss criticism of the requests as having been politically motivated. Here, they’re saying that the contexts are apolitical, though, of course, the actual requests weren’t.

“The evidence does not establish that President Trump withheld a meeting with President Zelensky for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election.”

The evidence shows quite clearly that Sondland demanded investigations from Ukraine before approving a Trump-Zelensky meeting in Washington; he said as much. He also testified that he did so in compliance with Giuliani’s wishes — after being told by Trump that he and his colleagues should work with Giuliani on Ukraine in that May 23 meeting.

More specifically, there’s ample documentary evidence and testimony to suggest that Trump specifically requested that Ukraine agree to investigations before a meeting would move forward, including a chain of communications from the White House to an adviser to a senior Zelensky aide right before the July 25 call in which the aide was instructed that a meeting depended on new investigations. On the call, Trump didn’t invite Zelensky to the White House until after the investigations were agreed to.

In short, there’s little doubt that this was precisely the quid pro quo at stake.

“The evidence does not support that President Trump withheld U.S. security assistance to Ukraine for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election.”

Note the phrasing here: a lack of evidence that Trump withheld aid for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine. As established above, that may be the case — but it also doesn’t preclude Trump from having understood that the stoppage in aid put pressure on Ukraine to comply with his wishes. There was no rationale given for stopping the aid, leading Sondland to assume that the halt was linked to the desire for the investigations (since the White House meeting was explicitly predicated on the same thing). In his testimony, Holmes argued that Ukraine would have come to the same conclusion.

The aid was released only after questions had already emerged about whether it was stopped to pressure Ukraine to launch new probes that were politically useful to Trump. It was released only after congressional Democrats announced an investigation of Giuliani’s efforts and why the aid was stopped in the first place.

When Sondland told Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) that the aid was halted to force the investigations, Johnson raised the question with Trump. Trump insisted that there was no link — but that he needed to know what had happened in 2016.

“The evidence does not support that President Trump orchestrated a shadow foreign policy apparatus for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election.”

During her testimony, Hill described Sondland’s efforts and how they contrasted with the formal diplomatic process.

“I was upset with him that he wasn’t fully telling us about all of the meetings that he was having,” she testified. “And he said to me: ‘But I’m briefing the president, I’m briefing Chief of Staff [Mick] Mulvaney, I’m briefing Secretary [Mike] Pompeo, and I’ve talked to Ambassador [John] Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with?’ ”

“And the point is, we have a robust interagency process that deals with Ukraine,” she continued. “It includes Mr. Holmes. It includes Ambassador [Bill] Taylor as the chargé in Ukraine. It includes a whole load of other people. But it struck me when yesterday, when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland’s emails, and who was on these emails, and he said … ‘these people need to know,’ that he was absolutely right.”

“Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were being involved in national security foreign policy,” she said. “And those two things had just diverged. So he was correct.”

Put simply, Hill and others in the formal diplomatic channel saw Sondland’s efforts as distinct from that effort. Sondland saw his job as effecting Ukraine policy in accordance with Giuliani’s focus, at Trump’s request — and that included explicitly leveraging a White House meeting for the desired investigations.

That’s not reconcilable with the presentation made in the Republican “finding.”

“The evidence does not support that President Trump covered up the substance of his telephone conversation with President Zelensky by restricting access to the call summary.”

One of the allegations made in the original whistleblower complaint was that the White House tried to prevent people from learning about Trump’s call with Zelensky by moving the rough transcript to a more secure storage system.

While multiple witnesses indicated that they didn’t see that move as necessarily nefarious (including Vindman), the rationale for moving it was, according to former NSC staffer Tim Morrison, to prevent it from leaking.

The Republicans are unequivocally correct on one point: The order to move it didn’t come from Trump but from an NSC attorney.

“President Trump’s assertion of longstanding claims of executive privilege is a legitimate response to an unfair, abusive, and partisan process, and does not constitute obstruction of a legitimate impeachment inquiry.”"

It’s possibly related to an Irish last name or perhaps it was ginned up by a cartoonist in San Francisco. Regardless, almost no one in American history has been as deliberate in embracing the term as Biden, whose tour of Iowa this week is taking place in a bus emblazoned with a large “No Malarkey!” slogan.

The heyday of “malarkey” on the pages of The Post came in the 1980s. There were a few little bursts before, including in the late 1800s, when Washington Senators pitcher John Malarkey was racking up a grim 2-10 record over three seasons. In the 1940s, Western High School slugger Jack Malarkey got fairly regular write-ups in the paper. By the 1980s, though, the word’s appearances were mostly of the sort that Biden would appreciate. By the 2000s, the popularity of the word had died again.

Google’s extensive index of books allows us to see how the popularity of words evolves over time. Its Ngram tool shows the frequency of words as a percentage of all words from books published in a particular year.

That data shows that use of “malarkey” spiked in books in the 1980s, just as it did in The Post. Interestingly, “malarkey” seems to have edged out “malarky,” with the latter spelling dying out from the 1960s on, as use of the former continued to gain steam. There’s a slight drop-off beginning about 2004; the Google Books data only goes through 2008.

Biden uses the more popular -ey spelling, perhaps a reflection of his embrace of it during its 1980s renaissance. There’s this sense from Biden critics that he’s embracing a wildly archaic phrase like “the bee’s knees.” Instead, it seems he’s harking back to a term that was resurgent when he was in his late 30s and early 40s — and when his political power and professional stature were expanding. It’s perhaps less like Biden talking about wearing an onion on his belt than his being able to sing along with “Livin’ on a Prayer.”

Cultural phenomenons recur in a cyclical fashion, though the duration of those cycles isn’t constant. It seems feasible that the 1980s brought nostalgia for a term that had emerged 30-plus years earlier — and that Biden is single-handedly powering a renaissance another 30-plus years on. “Malarkey” may be doing for Biden what “Make America Great Again” did for Trump on a smaller scale in evoking the era of President Ronald Reagan.

Most of his embrace of the term is about branding, reinforcing his political identity, and the traits we identified at the beginning of the article. He’s the guy who called Republican ideas “malarkey” and he’s the guy who uses terms like “malarkey” because he’s old and centered and willing to use normal-guy terms like “malarkey” even if that is abnormal.

There’s a corniness to it that is on-brand for Biden. It’s the sort of thing that seems like it could appeal to older voters (and older white voters) more than anyone else. That’s a group that makes up a large chunk of the population, if only a smaller part of the Democratic primary electorate. (Biden’s distinctive strength in the primary is among black Democratic voters.)

Some of the earliest uses of “malarkey” in the New York Times were references to Irish Americans who bore that last name. One article from Nov. 28, 1878, notes that an Officer Malarkey arrested a guy named Martin Smith for, of all things, voting illegally. Smith was a felon who thought his release from prison enabled him to vote again. It did not.

It is unclear whether this Officer Malarkey is the same one who the Times reported several years later had been bitten on the ear by a suspect.

They’ve heard the over-the-top pandering before and gritted their teeth as politicians who had never shown up presume to tell them what is wrong in their communities. Biden does not have to stress and strain, nor present glitzy proposals to convince them of his sincerity; his heart is in the right place, and that is enough for many older African American votes.

For Biden, the overwhelming support of these voters is his best and only shot at the nomination. The New York Times reports that “an overwhelming majority of delegates are awarded from areas more racially diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests.” If you look simply at the delegate count, “While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates.” Victories in later states with more delegates and more African American voters are Biden’s best hope of winning what may be a long, closely contested race.

AD

AD

Biden’s biggest fear is that poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire will unravel his campaign, causing African American and other voters to look for a winning candidate. Biden is fortunate in that there is no single, obvious candidate to which African American voters are likely to migrate.

It is not for lack of trying. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is pulling out all the stops, first with a TV ad focused on South Carolina, smartly referencing his faith:

He was also in South Carolina seeking to prove his sincerity with African American voters. The Post reports on his visit to the Greenleaf Christian Church, pastored by the Rev. William J. Barber II:

AD

Buttigieg’s decision to worship with the Disciples of Christ congregation underscored the task that awaits him as he seeks to convince voters that he can credibly lead a diverse coalition to capture the White House. “I believe that I am here to make myself useful — that I am part of this political process to make myself useful, but also that I was put on this Earth in order to make myself useful to others,” Buttigieg told more than 100 members of the mixed-race congregation who stayed following the Sunday service to witness the candidate field questions for two hours from Barber, along with other faith leaders, activists and voters. “These are the values that I was taught by my parents. These are the values that I’m taught by my faith.”

Buttigieg is trying hard to make up for lacking the kind of decades-old relationship with the African American community that Biden enjoys. “Buttigieg also sat for a lesson of sorts, as Barber displayed slides showing maps aimed to illustrate the overlapping effects of voter suppression, poverty and other scourges. . . . Barber is pressing for a presidential debate on poverty and racism.” Unsurprisingly, “Buttigieg called that debate ‘imperative’ as he issued a ‘moral call to unity’ designed to ‘confront all of the interwoven and interlocking sources of systematic poverty and systematic racism.’”

AD

One almost feels sorry for Buttigieg as he racks his brain trying to show his good intentions as Biden stumbles through debate after debate — his African American supporters shrugging off every misstep, even ones that smack of racial paternalism.

No one knows how enduring Biden’s support will be nor how impactful Buttigieg wins in early states might be. However, Biden might be smart to look for some insurance in Nevada. That’s not a lily-white state, although not as heavily African American as South Carolina, which comes a week later.

AD

In 2016 African American and Hispanic voters made up a third of the Democratic electorate. Hillary Clinton’s modest victory against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who won the Hispanic vote, was due largely to her overwhelming victory with African American votes. If Biden wants a firewall after Iowa and New Hampshire, a quick way to dislodge candidates whose support is less diverse, he would be wise to spend plenty of time in Nevada. It’s not clear if “as goes Nevada, so goes South Carolina,” but a win there would sure help fend off competition from Buttigieg and other candidates who ran strongly in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) recent slip in the polls has been widely attributed to the rollout of her single-payer plan. (I’ve yet to see any actual evidence that her health-care plan is what produced that fall; it’s just what everyone seems to assume.) And suddenly it seems that there’s a multitude of voices, Democrat and Republican, assailing Medicare-for-all.

AD

AD

I’m sure many of those critics are perfectly sincere. But as The Post’s Jeff Stein reports, there’s more going on behind the scenes:

Lobbyists either helped draft or made extensive revisions to opinion columns published by three state lawmakers in a way that warned against the dangers of Medicare-for-all and other government involvement in health care, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client. Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms.

This is hardly the first time a lobbyist or representative of an interest group wrote an op-ed for a legislator, but it’s an important reminder of what’s happening with the health-care debate. On one side, you’ve got some pro-Medicare-for-all groups such as Physicians for a National Health Program, with modest budgets and small staffs. (PNHP has a staff of four.) In the middle, you have Democratic presidential candidates arguing about how far to go on health-care reform. And on the other side, you have insurers, hospitals, drug companies, device companies and other health-care interests who together wouldn’t think twice about dropping hundreds of millions of dollars to destroy Medicare-for-all and anything that resembles it.

After all, there are tens of billions of dollars in profits at stake. Which is why those groups formed the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, which will be the vanguard of the war on health-care reform should a Democrat be elected president and try to get an ambitious bill passed.

AD

AD

Here’s one of the most important things to understand about these interests: They despise “moderate” reform as much as they do Medicare-for-all. There are reasons the kind of expansive public-option plan being offered by Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg is more politically practical than single-payer, but opposition from industry is not one of them. Just look, for instance, at this ad from the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, in which actors doing their best worried faces say, “Politicians may call it Medicare-for-all, Medicare buy-in or the public option, but they mean the same thing: higher taxes or higher premiums, lower quality care, politicians and bureaucrats in control of our care.”

Although a single-payer system obviously presents the greatest threat to their profits, their belief is that any reform that allows large numbers of people to move on to government programs makes genuine cost control more likely, and that’s what they want to avoid.

In what may be the most revealing moment in the article showing consultants associated with the Partnership crafting op-eds for state legislators, the consultant “removed three paragraphs from a draft of Kelker’s op-ed that pointed out that the United States 'clearly spends significantly more on health care per capita than other developed nations.’” This is one of the most important facts about our health-care problem, but it’s the last thing the Partnership and its backers want anyone thinking about. Why? Because if you start cutting costs, they make less money.

AD

AD

The current proposals for a public option envision huge numbers of Americans — tens or even hundreds of millions — moving over to public plans, depriving insurers of customers and facilitating future cost-cutting. So the health-care industry’s strategy is to fill Americans with terror, convincing them that any major reform will cost them more, give them poorer care and make them more insecure. Even if the opposite is almost certainly true on all counts.

This raises an important point all the Democratic presidential candidates should be forced to address. Any of them, if elected, would face a furious industry campaign to destroy their proposed health-care reform. All the candidates should explain how they plan to overcome it. As of yet, none of them have had much to say on the subject.

And to have any chance, the latest entrants, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, need Biden’s candidacy to collapse. Given the remarkable stability of Biden’s support after an initial drop in the summer, this opening may never come.

AD

In the meantime, Sanders’s loyalists on the party’s left have prevented Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) from consolidating the party’s progressive wing.

As a result, the roughly 40 percent of the party that supports either Biden or Sanders is, for the moment, largely out of the reach of other contenders. The remaining 60 percent floats around in search of an alternative.

AD

This dynamic has led to the latest twists in the campaign: Warren, after soaring to the top of the pack, has fallen back, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has emerged as a major figure in the contest.

The findings of two Quinnipiac polls, one released last week, the other in late October, underscored the volatility of the contest among those voters not committed to either Biden or Sanders.

In the October poll, Warren led the field with 28 percent, with Biden at 21 percent, Sanders at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

AD

The latest survey showed Biden back on top with 24 percent, Buttigieg at 16 percent, Warren at 14 percent and Sanders at 13 percent.

AD

The relative stability of the Biden and Sanders numbers pointed to another key finding in the November survey: Overall, only 33 percent of the Democrats surveyed said they had made up their minds. But 43 percent of Biden supporters and 49 percent of Sanders supporters expressed this degree of certainty; by contrast, only 29 percent of Warren backers and 25 percent of Buttigieg’s said they had made up their minds.

The survey did contain two pieces of good news for Warren, signs of her residual strength. She still ranks first as the candidate with the best policy ideas. And she was by far the leading second choice, picked as the alternative by 35 percent of Sanders’s supporters, 43 percent of Buttigieg’s and 19 percent of Biden’s.

AD

This could provide the basis for a comeback. But the news for now is of how a candidate who seemed briefly on the verge of dominating the contest (with leads nationally and in both Iowa and New Hampshire, which vote first) was pulled down by the sustained attacks of her opponents, wonks and pundits.

AD

The proximate cause of her decline was her struggle over a single-payer health plan. She endorsed it after showing an initial reluctance. Then she detailed a plan for how she would pay for it, to mixed reviews. Then she pulled back by saying she wouldn’t introduce a Medicare-for-all plan until her third year in office.

The saga was a lesson in how complicated defending single-payer would be in a general-election campaign. But the fact that Warren appears, for now at least, to have shed so much support so quickly is a measure of the unstable terrain in which candidates other than Biden and Sanders are trying to root their candidacies.

AD

It will now be Buttigieg’s turn to try to transform a surge of positive feeling into enduring support. He has, polls suggest, begun to break through with one group that had eluded him: whites without college degrees. But he is still being virtually shut out among African Americans, the most loyal component of the Democratic coalition.

AD

It is a Buttigieg strength that he is a fresh and intelligent voice well removed from past Democratic fights. But this leaves him without a history that sustains old loyalties of the sort that have benefited Biden and Sanders, candidates more than twice his age.

Whatever they disagree on, Democratic primary voters are united by their passion to defeat President Trump. The indecision in their ranks reflects their difficulty in deciding who among their current choices can get that job done.

Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, has framed his faith as a counterpoint to the religious right. And scripture became the common ground between the soft-spoken mayor — clad in his signature dark suit — and the pastor with a clergyman’s collar and gold-accented clerical stole. When Buttigieg, arguing the biblical case for welfare, remarked that he couldn’t “count the number of times the word ‘poor’ shows up in scripture,” Barber supplied an answer. “2,000,” he interjected.

The 56-year-old pastor pointedly declined to ask Buttigieg about his sexuality, saying he would no more put the question to an airline pilot. “But I did ask him, ‘Could he fly the plane?’ ” Barber remarked, as applause rang out in the pews.

Barber was hardly silent on the theme, however. He opened the service by denying that anti-gay hostility was pervasive in the black community. “Stop putting that on black folk,” Barber preached. “There’s some phobia among all folks.”

AD

He called the notion of a rift between gay people and blacks a “false narrative that was created by the National Organization for Marriage to separate people who, when they come together, have always pushed America forward, especially when it comes to addressing issues like poverty and health care.”

Buttigieg, addressing reporters after he left the sanctuary, said, “I don’t think I could say it any better than that.”

AD

In recent days, the candidate has suggested that his identity as a gay man gives him greater empathy with the experiences of other marginalized groups — a point that raised eyebrows among some members of the black community, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.).

But the argument resonated with Raymond E. Smith Jr., a black state representative in North Carolina who attended Sunday’s service and discussion. “Not a lot of white men know what it’s like to be discriminated against,” Smith said. “But he brings to the table personal experiences that would be beneficial.”

AD

Others were more skeptical of the mayor, whose experience in elected office is limited to stewarding South Bend, Ind., a city of just over 100,000. Buttigieg has faced criticism of his record on race and policing in his hometown.

AD

“Anyone can say anything,” said Yolanda Peterson, 36. “Let’s wait and see.”

Barber neither endorsed the mayor and veteran of the war in Afghanistan nor confronted him over areas where his policy prescriptions diverge from those of the Poor People’s Campaign.

For instance, the anti-poverty campaign co-chaired by Barber calls for a single-payer health care system, while Buttigieg favors a less sweeping overhaul and has assailed his left-wing rivals for their support for so-called Medicare-for-all.

“My plan is to make sure everybody is insured,” Buttigieg assured a woman who rose to describe the experience of burying her son, who had lacked coverage. Meanwhile, the candidate touted the benefits of public education by describing the value of “shared things,” even as he has criticized some of his competitors’ plans for tuition-free public colleges and universities.

AD

Buttigieg also sat for a lesson of sorts, as Barber displayed slides showing maps aimed to illustrate the overlapping effects of voter suppression, poverty and other scourges. The minister said all presidential candidates were welcome to come to Goldsboro to discuss poverty. Nine of them appeared over the summer at a forum hosted by the Poor People’s Campaign in Washington. Barber is pressing for a presidential debate on poverty and racism.

Buttigieg called that debate “imperative” as he issued a “moral call to unity” designed to “confront all of the interwoven and interlocking sources of systematic poverty and systematic racism.”

“We’re going to need a leader who can bring us together from the White House in order to confront these concerns,” he told reporters before departing for neighboring South Carolina, part of a several-day swing through the South that will also take him to Alabama.

AD

AD

Polling indicates Buttigieg has his work cut out for him. In a Quinnipiac survey released Nov. 18, he registered at 6 percent overall in South Carolina, trailing former vice president Joe Biden, who enjoyed a comfortable lead, as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Forty-seven percent of respondents said they had not heard enough about the 37-year-old mayor to form an opinion of him.

If he is to energize the coalition envisioned by Barber — which cuts across racial and economic lines — Buttigieg has ground to make up not simply in the black community but among the poor voters whom the minister sees as their natural allies. In an earlier Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina, he registered at just 2 percent among those making less than $50,000 a year.

Barber said the conversation on Sunday represented a start.

“He came, he listened and he learned,” Barber said in a brief interview after Buttigieg had rolled away in his black Suburban.

The Policies

IMPEACHMENT BUT FIRST, MADRID: Impeachment mania is about to hit the House. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is overseas touting another important Democratic priority: tackling climate change.

Timing is everything: The delegation of more than a dozen Democrats to the United Nations's Convention on Climate Change serves as evidence that Pelosi is serious about her promise to “walk and chew gum” on impeachment — and to not lose sight of issues that affect everyday Americans even as the House heads into one of the most intense weeks of the inquiry against Trump so far.

Key: “Members are here because climate change is a critical issue for the U.S. and their constituents,” a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world.""

a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world."" More: ""The House is continuing its work as the impeachment inquiry continues, including taking important opportunities like this one to attend the annual UN climate conference.”

Climate change has steadily climbed up U.S. voters' list of concerns: Some 72 percent of Democrats called climate change an issue that's “very important” to them personally — second only to health care — in a CBS News poll from September.

Eye on 2020: President Trump promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement to lower greenhouse gas emissions — but the pullout cannot take effect until at least a day after the 2020 presidential election. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration submitted an official notice to leave the accord, making the U.S. the only nation to abandon the global effort to address climate change.

Democratic lawmakers say they want to be clear that U.S. leadership on this issue would return if one of their candidates is elected to the Oval Office.

The message at the COP25 conference: “The U.S. is still committed to climate action, notwithstanding Trump,” Chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), told Power Up on Sunday evening from Madrid.

Castor, whose panel will release a report advising congressional committees on potential climate action by March of next year, said it's possible that the delegation will meet with other world leaders on the sidelines of the conference.

Busy week ahead: Upon the Speaker's arrival back in Washington, she'll hit the ground running as the House moves at a breakneck pace to investigate the potential impeachment of Trump.

Big picture: While Democratic leaders ""have not committed to a firm timeline, Tuesday’s meeting keeps the House on a trajectory to possibly approve articles of impeachment on the House floor before Christmas, setting up a Senate trial on Trump’s removal early in the new year.""

The agenda in Madrid is packed, too: Countries will be under pressure to make additional commitments to reduce their carbon emissions in the wake of a string of grim reports that show that the world is not on track to reach the Paris agreement's ambitious target.

Just last week the U.N. released its annual “emissions gap” report which showed that the Earth's average temperatures is on pace to rise 3.9 degrees Celsius, as opposed to the Paris accord's agreement to keep temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday in Madrid before the conference. “What is still lacking is political will... Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.”

Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.” It's a priority for Pelosi: “Taking action to protect our planet is a public health decision for clean air and clean water for our children, an economic decision for creating the green, good-paying jobs of the future, a national security decision to address resource competition and climate migration and also a moral decision to be good stewards of God’s creation and pass a sustainable, healthy planet to the next generation,” Pelosi said in a statement this weekend.

Castor told Power Up that some Republican lawmakers were invited to join the delegation but all declined. There will be a small, relatively low-profile team of diplomats who will also be attending the summit on behalf of the Trump administration. They will be focusing on what Pompeo has described as “a realistic and pragmatic model” on climate issues.

“The U.S. team is set to be led by two career officials from the State Department: climate negotiator Kim Carnahan and Marcia Bernicat, a principal deputy assistant secretary,” per Bloomberg's Jennifer Dlouhy.

“And, in another shift, political appointees from the Trump administration also won’t be attending, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement,” Dlouhy reports.

Pelosi, who has made diplomacy a hallmark of her speakership in the Trump era, is not the only one who will be traveling abroad this week to keep a focus on policy.

Not impeachment: Trump will head to London for a meeting to mark NATO's 70th anniversary. Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey.

Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey. Trump also hit the road over the holiday, taking a page from former President Bill Clinton's playbook: to look hard at work especially on the economy even as impeachment loomed: ""Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware,"" per our colleague Phil Rucker. This comes after Clinton's former chief strategist Mark Penn visited the White House last month.

The Investigations

THE WEEK AHEAD IN IMPEACHMENT:

The White House stays away: “White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday,” our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report.

The full 5-page letter is largely an attack on the House's impeachment process, arguing that Dems failed to provide enough opportunities for Trump to participate.

The biggest question is how long this refusal lasts : “Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings,” our colleagues write. The counsel pressed Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to detail plans for future hearings and questioned whether the White House would be able to cross-examine witnesses, including those who have testified in the public hearings.

What’s next?: The White House faces a Friday night deadline to detail what, if any, role they will plan in future proceedings.

Members of the Intelligence Committee will have 24 hours to review the report: It will be available to them starting at 6 p.m. tonight, Mike and Karoun report. “Their exact findings are not publicly known, but the report is expected to lay out a case for Trump’s abuse of his presidential powers — that he used the promise of a White House meeting and the withholding of military aid approved by Congress to compel Ukraine’s government to launch politically motivated investigations into his political rivals,” our colleagues write.

The Judiciary Committee is back in the spotlight: Wednesday's hearing will be the first from the panel that historically writes articles of impeachment since the Intelligence committee began its process. Four constitutional scholars are expected to testify on the standards for impeachment — three chosen by Democrats, one by Republicans, our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report. The names of the witnesses have not yet been released, much to Republicans' frustration.

Meanwhile, Republicans continue to slam the speedy timeline: Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, ""attacked the timeline that Democratic leaders are pursuing, one that appears aimed at concluding an impeachment vote in the House before Christmas rather, he argued, than providing appropriate due process for the president,"" per our colleagues.

“They want to get this president right now before everybody completely sees through the process sham of the elections for next year,” Collins said. “So we’re rushing this.""

And one senator, John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), “said that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so,” our colleague Felicia Sonmez reports. NBC's “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd pressed the senator on the fact that this is an argument that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to see repeated by American politicians.

Lisa Page breaks her silence: The former FBI lawyer spoke to Molly Jong-Fast for a Daily Beast profile that details the personal toll Trump's taunts have taken on her, Page's concern over the future of the FBI and, most importantly, why she feels an upcoming report from the Justice Department's inspector general report will show she did not act unprofessionally or show bias against Trump.

Key quote: “But it's also very intimidating because he’s still the president of the United States,"" Page says of Trump's constant attacks. ""And when the president accuses you of treason by name, despite the fact that I know there's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that. To try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he’s not publicly attacking me.”

I decided to take my power back.” Per Molly, ""the president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally"" in October.

TRUMP TAKES ON NATO, AGAIN: Trump is currently set to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte at the NATO meeting, according to a senior administration official. Queen Elizabeth II is also hosting a reception to honor the occasion.

The top-tier spending club is growing: Trump as president has delighted in hammering fellow members for not spending enough on their militaries.

Carrots ahead of the visit: “The top-tier spending club — with at least 2 percent of annual gross domestic product allocated for defense — expanded by one country and now includes Bulgaria, according to figures released by the military alliance,"" Our colleague Michael Birnbaum reports.

Do not endorse: Trump's appearance will occur just days before Britain holds its national election. ""If past is prologue, the odds of Trump intervening in Britain’s electoral politics again in the coming days are high,"" our colleagues William Booth and Karla Adam report. The president is deeply unpopular in the country and his words could roil a campaign that is supposed to render the path forward for Brexit.

Trump is not currently set to meet with Johnson: For his part, Johnson ""tried to diplomatically dissuade the American president from offering his opinions on domestic affairs,"" our colleagues write. ""What we don’t do traditionally as loving allies and friends, what we don’t do traditionally, is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,"" Johnson said.

The Campaign

UPDATE ON THE TRAIL:

Biden rides the bus: “Former vice president Joe Biden kicked off an eight-day, 18-county bus tour Saturday as he ramps up his campaigning in rural Iowa,” the Des Moines Register's Stephen Gruber-Miller reports. It's dubbed the “No Malarkey” bus tour after one of the most famous Bidenisms.

Warren's numbers tank after Medicare-for-all debacle: “Recent polling suggests Warren has sustained political damage from her health-care policy. After climbing to the top of the field by focusing on a message of overhauling Washington and Wall Street, Warren plateaued as her campaign became consumed with health care,” our colleagues Annie Linskey, Jeff Stein and Dan Balz report.

Key graf: “The irony is that a candidate whose political identity has been built in part on her reputation as a policy wonk — a potential president who boasts of having a plan for nearly every challenge facing everyday Americans — has been tripped up by a policy issue that has dominated politics and defined her party for years,' our colleagues write.

Buttigieg goes on the offensive over college costs and gets slammed: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg unveiled a new ad attacking unnamed candidates (*cough* Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders) for wanting the government to cover the cost of everyone, “including the kids of millionaires.” The message fits perfectly with the more moderate tone Buttigieg is striking, but not everyone welcomed it.

AOC blasts Buttigieg: “This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently endorsed Sanders, wrote on Twitter.

Harris's campaign gets torched in scathing report: “In one instance after another, [Harris] and her closest advisers made flawed decisions about which states to focus on, issues to emphasize and opponents to target, all the while refusing to make difficult personnel choices to impose order on an unwieldy campaign,” the Times's Jonathan Martin, Astead W. Herndon and Alexander Burns report.

Key observation: “The 2020 Democratic field has been defined by its turbulence, with some contenders rising, others dropping out and two more jumping in just this month,” the Times reports. “Yet there is only one candidate who rocketed to the top tier and then plummeted in early state polls to the low single digits: [Harris].”

The #YangGang breaks the bank: “Andrew Yang raised $750,000 on Nov. 30, his single best fundraising day to date of his campaign,” Politico's Zach Montellaro reports. The crazy part? The haul was not tied to a debate or one of those end-of-quarter pleas that flood inboxes."

It also marks a departure from efforts by the late Arizona senator to build bipartisan alliances and further broad foreign policy ideals pursued by Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush. That approach is unrecognizable today as the GOP has become the party of Donald Trump and his “America First” approach.

“I knew the ‘three amigos’ and believe me, these are not three amigos like we were,” said Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic, then independent senator from Connecticut who was part of the original group with Republicans McCain and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

AD

Lieberman said he believes McCain, his longtime friend, would be “really upset about what’s happening in Ukraine now.”

The House impeachment inquiry has detailed how the self-described “three amigos” — European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland, outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker — operated an “irregular” foreign policy channel that was pushing Ukraine to announce the investigations Trump wanted. In return, the White House would release $400 million in military aid the Eastern European ally needed to counter Russian aggression and would arrange a coveted Oval Office visit with Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

AD

Led by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, the trio assembled as a loose contingent of envoys whose activities were initially unseen by others in the administration specializing in Ukraine issues. But as their actions became known, the ``amigos’’ set off alarms among diplomats and officials who described them as pursuing the president’s political agenda over U.S. national security interests.

AD

Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House, testified before the impeachment inquiry that at one point she confronted Sondland to ask on whose authority he was operating in Ukraine.

The president, Sondland responded, according to Hill.

State Department official David Holmes testified that Sondland, Perry and Volker “styled themselves as the three amigos and made clear they would take the lead on coordinating our policy and engagement with for the Zelenskiy administration.”

AD

Holmes said that ``over the following months, it became apparent that Mr. Giuliani was having a direct influence on the foreign policy agenda that the three amigos were executing on the ground in Ukraine.”

Presidents have often used back channels to facilitate foreign policy and leverage U.S. resources to achieve their policy goals, experts say. The difference is that Trump’s approach, as outlined in the impeachment inquiry, appears to be mobilizing U.S. policy and resource for personal political gain.

AD

The Ukrainian matter is but one way the foreign policy landscape has shifted dramatically in the Trump era. As the White House pursues an “America First” agenda, the U.S. is seen as retreating from its traditional role of international engagement and democracy building and Trump is aligning himself with some of the world’s more autocratic leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.

AD

Richard Fontaine, a former McCain national security aide who is now chief executive officer at the Center for New American Security, said the broader, bipartisan agreement on the U.S. role in the world has now become a “debate over fundamentals.”

Fontaine said McCain’s ``amigos’’ believed that “when the U.S. could act for the betterment of people, it should act ... rather than trying to keep our nose out of things.”

AD

It was former Army Gen. David Petraeus who called McCain’s group the “three amigos” as the senators made frequent visits to Afghanistan and Iraq. They became the chief proponents of the troop increase that Bush proposed in 2006 and that Democrats and some Republicans derided as prolonging the unpopular war in Iraq.

AD

But the trio also traveled broadly, including in Ukraine, where McCain repeatedly addressed democracy activists as the former Soviet state reached to the West.

Volker, who recently stepped down from his position at the McCain Institute at Arizona State University, distanced himself from his new title as one of Trump’s amigos.

“Much has been made of the term ‘three amigos’ in reference to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland and myself,” Volker said in opening remarks before the impeachment inquiry.

AD

“I never used that term — and frankly cringe when I hear it because for me, the ‘three amigos’ will always refer to Sen. John McCain, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, in reference to their work to support the surge in Iraq.”

AD

Brian Katulis, a national security expert at the Center for American Progress, said McCain’s “amigos” are all but gone in the Trump era.

“They stood for a certain vision of America’s role in the world — one that was more predictable and reliable — and one we don’t have today,” he said.

“That was certainly McCain’s legacy,” he said. “Like a lot of things in the GOP, it’s so far gone because Trump has obliterated a lot of the ideals.”

Robust evidence that Trump leveraged his position to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations that would benefit him politically has been set aside by Trump and his allies in favor of questions about process, a focus on the whistleblower who brought the situation to light — and who has overwhelmingly been validated — and a redirection of blame toward Trump’s original targets, including former vice president Joe Biden.

Next week, we'll have another entry into this set, the release of a report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz assessing the origins of the Russia investigation that evolved into Mueller's probe. It has been hailed for months as being potentially explosive, depicted by Trump's allies and the conservative media as likely revealing broad malfeasance on the part of the intelligence community in unfairly targeting Trump and his campaign before his election as president.

Early indicators are that this expectation will be not be fulfilled. The Washington Post’s national security team reported last month that the report “generally rebuts accusations of a political conspiracy among senior law enforcement officials against the Trump campaign to favor Democrat Hillary Clinton while also knocking the bureau for procedural shortcomings in the FBI.” The New York Times reports that Horowitz determined that many of the most common theories among Trump backers about the origins of the Russia probe — that it was an attempt to spy on his campaign or that it lacked proper predication — will not be upheld.

We'll see what it says. On Monday morning, though, we got a glimpse of how the Horowitz report is nonetheless likely to be received.

AD

AD

The Daily Beast’s Molly Jong-Fast obtained an interview with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who has been pushed to the center of theories about a conspiracy to unfairly target Trump. She exchanged messages with another FBI employee, former special agent Peter Strzok, in which the pair discussed the investigation into Russian interference — which Strzok led — and in which they disparaged Trump himself before the 2016 election. As a result of those interactions, Strzok was removed from Mueller’s team early in the investigation.

A separate report from the inspector general released in June 2018 determined that the discussions were “antithetical to the core values of the FBI” and threatened the bureau’s “reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence,” but that there was nonetheless no evidence that the pair’s disparagement of Trump affected any investigations.

Despite that finding, the Strzok-Page texts have become a central component of theories about how Trump was unfairly targeted. The Justice Department initially released a subset of the messages focused on disparaging Trump, while others, released later, were culled to suggest nefarious activity. None has become more commonly cited than one in which Strzok refers to an “insurance policy” in the event Trump were to win the election.

AD

AD

The Page interview was the first time she’d presented her experiences in the media. She expressed frustration at how the interactions were framed and at the way in which her romantic relationship with Strzok became an undercurrent of criticism of what they’d done. She told Jong-Fast it was Trump’s depiction of the two in that context at a rally in Minnesota that spurred her to speak to the media.

That, unsurprisingly, was also the context in which the interview with Page was presented by the hosts of “Fox & Friends” on Monday.

Page is “one of the so-called FBI lovebirds,” host Steve Doocy said to introduce the segment, echoing a line used by Trump. (The Fox News show is, of course, almost unfailingly aligned with Trump’s political rhetoric.) He suggested there was something suspect about the timing of the Page interview: “A lot of people say, why is she done being quiet the week before the IG report comes out?”

AD

AD

The hosts walked through the interview briefly, at one point quoting Page’s response to Trump’s targeting of her.

“The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world. He's demeaning me and my career. It's sickening,” Page said, as quoted by host Brian Kilmeade. “But it's the president's belief that he was part of possibly a plot to upend his presidency ahead of time,” he then added. “And I think it's safe to say he's a little ticked.""

A bit later, he criticizes Jong-Fast for not pressing Page harder. Page notes that the Russia probe began with the revelation that a Trump campaign adviser named George Papadopoulos had been informed by a London-based professor that Russia had emails incriminating Clinton. He later told an Australian diplomat about that conversation over drinks, which the FBI learned about in July after WikiLeaks began releasing information stolen from the Democratic National Committee and the Australian government conveyed what it had learned.

AD

AD

“Page says, ‘The FBI gets the predication to look into Trump by George Papadopoulos, which starts the whole Russia investigation,’” Kilmeade said. “Which goes back to the biggest questions people have: Who was talking to George Papadopoulos? Where is this professor that started this whole thing? Where’s the ambassador that meets him by chance in a bar? This goes back into it. And there’s no follow-up question from the Daily Beast reporter.”

Perhaps because all of this has been well established. In 2017, Papadopoulos admitted to having lied to federal investigators about his interactions with the professor, Joseph Mifsud. He admitted further that Mifsud took an interest in him only after learning he’d been tapped by the Trump campaign. After serving a prison sentence for lying about Mifsud and when he was told about the stolen emails — and before announcing a congressional campaign — Papadopoulos has publicly insisted that Mifsud was part of a plot to frame him, something Kilmeade is echoing given its utility in presenting the Russia probe as unfairly targeting Trump. But in a sworn statement (and as summarized in Mueller’s report), Papadopoulos had already admitted how his interaction with Mifsud evolved.

“Well, don’t forget,” host Ainsley Earhardt added, “they were talking about in those text messages the insurance policy. If Hillary Clinton had won, none of this would have even come to light.""

AD

AD

This is, again, one of the central misrepresentations of the Strzok-Page texts (including, again, by Trump).

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,” Strzok wrote on Aug. 15, 2016. “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before 40.""

The context for the message was the referenced meeting with then-FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. The group was discussing how aggressively to pursue an investigation into Russian interference, with Page, suggesting that they move slowly since Trump was unlikely to win. Moving slowly had a specific rationale: Doing so would allow the FBI to better protect its sources. Strzok disagreed, suggesting they needed to move quickly just in case Trump did win — something that seemed as unlikely in August 2016 as a 40-year-old suddenly dropping dead. If Trump won, they’d need to have vetted his possible team in case any were compromised, something that required moving fast and potentially burning sources. Not likely, but, then, 40-year-olds have life insurance policies just in case.

AD

AD

That explanation makes more sense than the Earhardt-Trump explanation, which isolates “insurance policy” to suggest that Page and Strzok wanted to use the Russia investigation as a way to pressure Trump after he won. Why, if the goal was to have leverage over Trump, didn’t they simply release what they had before the election to keep him from winning? By mid-September, Trump and Clinton were nearly tied in the polls, as they were shortly before the election. Why not interfere at one of those points? There was a public acknowledgment of questions about one of the candidates right before the 2016 election, of course — targeting Clinton.

Again, Earhardt is blithely reiterating a theory that’s already been explained. The explanation is inconvenient to the idea that Trump was unfairly targeted, though, so it’s set aside in favor of the insinuation — assuming the Fox hosts have ever even been exposed to the explanation.

On Twitter, Trump ally Charlie Kirk offered his own conspiracy theory about the Page-Strzok text messages.

AD

AD

“Did you know,” he wrote, “Robert Mueller’s office deleted 19,000 text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok""? What, he continued, “were they trying to cover up?""

The answer is simple: Nothing, because he’s wrong. There weren’t 19,000 deleted messages but, instead, 19,000 messages that weren’t saved using the bureau’s established protocol for capturing messages because of a technical glitch. Most of those messages were nonetheless later recovered. Messages the pair exchanged on iPhones issued when they began working for Mueller were not stored, though the messages on Strzok’s phone were reviewed and determined not to be substantive. That review, mind you, happened after Strzok was removed from the team out of concern about his past exchanges with Page.

This, too, was known before Monday. But it’s not part of the story that Kirk and Trump and the “Fox & Friends” team want to tell. They, instead, pick out particular things from that vast buffet — after-the-fact claims by Papadopoulos, later-debunked news articles about deleted text messages, Trump’s own rhetoric — and lift them up to suggest that questions about Russian interference in 2016 were always about stopping Trump."

Massive voting machine failures in a Pennsylvania county in November are giving election security advocates fresh ammunition to call for nationwide paper ballots.

The problems, which may have been caused by a software glitch, resulted in some Northampton County residents who tried to vote straight-ticket Democrat initially registering as straight-ticket Republican. It also incorrectly showed a Republican judicial candidate winning by a nearly statistically impossible margin, the New York Times’ Nick Corasaniti reports.

In this case, voters got lucky. The county had paper backups for all the votes the machine counted incorrectly. They showed the Democrat judicial candidate Abe Kassis — who the computer tally said got just 164 votes out of 55,000 ballots — actually narrowly won the race.

But about 16 million Americans spread across eight states won’t have a paper backup for their votes in 2020. That means a similar software glitch or a malicious hack by Russia or another U.S. adversary could cause mass uncertainty about an election’s outcome or even result in the wrong candidate taking office.

Even in Pennsylvania, it could have been different. The machines that malfunctioned in November were just purchased this year in response to a statewide mandate to upgrade to new voting machines with paper records.

Election security hawks have been pushing the importance of paper backups since 2016, when Russia probed election systems across more than a dozen states and penetrated systems in Illinois and Florida, according to the Mueller report. But even in 2016 there's no evidence any votes were counted incorrectly.

That's why the Pennsylvania debacle offers stark new evidence for how badly things could go wrong with no paper backups in place, degrading public faith in elections.

“People were questioning, and even I questioned, that if some of the numbers are wrong, how do we know that there aren’t mistakes with anything else?” Matthew Munsey, the chairman of the Northampton County Democrats, told Nick.

Lee Snover, chairwoman of the county Republicans, was just as worried. “There are concerns for 2020. Nothing went right on Election Day. Everything went wrong. That’s a problem,” she said.

Officials haven’t determined what caused the failures, but a senior intelligence official who focuses on election security told Nick there were “no visible signs of outside meddling by any foreign actors.” The miscount shows, however, how voting machine vulnerabilities could be exploited by Russia, China or Iran — which U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies said last month are all eager to interfere in the 2020 contest.

Presidential candidates were quick to make that connection.

Here’s Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who sponsored the main Senate bill that would deliver more election security money to states in exchange for paper ballots and other fixes.

All you have to do is read this to see why I’m focused on election security & passing my bills for back-up paper ballots & systematic audits. As Fiona Hill said, Russia is “gearing up.” And that’s just one possibility. https://t.co/4r3uJibzTS via @NYTimes — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) November 30, 2019

Here’s Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who dropped out of the race this morning:

Elections are the foundation of our democracy. It's far past time for us to invest in new equipment, poll worker training, and protections for our election systems from both physical and cyber threats. https://t.co/muBHVtQMcp — Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) November 30, 2019

House Democrats have passed bills that would require paper backups for all votes and deliver $600 million for states to upgrade voting machines and add other cybersecurity protections. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has blocked any bills that mandate specific election security fixes.

Some House Democrats were quick to seize on the Pennsylvania debacle to push the Senate to act.

Here’s Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.):

One of the most common sense bills we've passed in the House is one that requires paper back up ballots for all federal elections. Read this and you'll see why! https://t.co/crIIlTn6gH — Tom Malinowski (@Malinowski) November 30, 2019

The story also sparked concern in states that will lack paper records for some voters in 2020.

Here’s John Ray Clemmons, a Democratic state representative from Tennessee:

This should concern (and, frankly, scare the heck out of) every Tennessean. Demand that your county’s #voting machines are up to date, produce a paper trail, & protected from hacking with modern, readily available and affordable tech (ie Albert sensors). https://t.co/wFpEb3Srwj — John Ray Clemmons (@JRClemmons) December 1, 2019

And Sri Preston Kulkarni, a former diplomat who’s running as a Democrat for a House seat in Texas:

We must have integrity of our elections, including paper records of every ballot and machines tested to ensure they don't switch votes.



In this case, they found the problem because 99% of the Democratic votes weren't counted. But what if it was only 5%?https://t.co/ycWQVOkUeU — Sri Preston Kulkarni (@SriPKulkarni) December 1, 2019

Other states where some voters will lack paper records in 2020 are Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey and Mississippi, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.

Northampton also demonstrates the importance of automatic “risk limiting” audits after elections to make sure that paper records back up machine results.

In this case, there was such a wide margin of victory for the Republican candidate that it was obvious something was fishy. But if hackers or a software glitch caused a much smaller shift in votes, election officials might not have caught it without an audit.

Here’s Matt Blaze, co-founder of an annual challenge to find hackable bugs in election machines at the Def Con cybersecurity conference and a cryptography professor at Georgetown University:

The tally software clearly failed, giving the (apparent) actual loser a huge margin of victory (so large it wouldn’t ordinarily trigger a re-count). But an RLA WOULD catch this. So score one for RLAs. But... — matt blaze (@mattblaze) December 1, 2019

It’s HUGELY fortunate that this happened in an off year, relatively low stakes local election rather than, say, the 2020 presidential race. Assuming we actually learn from the experience. — matt blaze (@mattblaze) December 1, 2019

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

PINGED: The Trump administration is considering tightening Commerce Department rules to restrict sales of U.S. technology to Huawei even if that technology is in products manufactured outside the United States, two sources told Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld at Reuters.

The move follows a massive crackdown on U.S. companies selling directly to Huawei, which officials say could abet Chinese spying.

It could appeal to congressional China hawks who have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to keep U.S. technology out of Huawei's hands as it tries to dominate the market for next-generation 5G wireless networks. But it ""would be poorly received by U.S. allies and U.S. companies,” Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson told Reuters.

The potential change follows the Trump administration's decision last week to delay a blanket ban on most U.S. companies selling parts to Huawei for another 90 days.

Huawei and the Commerce department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

PATCHED: India's lead cybersecurity agency wants to audit WhatsApp's security systems after the accounts of 121 Indian users were allegedly hacked using tools from the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, Sankalp Phartiyal and Nigam Prusty at Reuters report.

Officials at the agency also want to know why WhatsApp executives, including CEO Will Cathcart, failed to mention the spyware attack when they met with Indian leaders in July and September. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, is suing NSO for the alleged hacks which affected roughly 1,400 users globally, including many journalists and activists.

The Indian government is also seeking answers from NSO on the malware attacks, Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. NSO has denied any wrongdoing.

PWNED: Just one-third of 2020 presidential campaigns are automatically rejecting or quarantining emails that come from suspicious domains and could be part of a phishing attack, TechCrunch's Zack Whittaker reports.

Candidates whose campaigns aren’t automatically rejecting suspicious emails include President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). That could put the campaigns at a higher risk of opening malware-laden phishing emails like the one that Russia used to target Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account in 2016.

“When a campaign doesn’t have the basics in place, they are leaving their front door unlocked,” Armen Najarian, chief identity officer at Agari, an email security company told Zack.

Campaigns for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are among those automatically rejecting or quarantining suspicious emails using a tool called DMARC, which verifies a sender's email is legitimate and rejects emails that may be spoofing a real email in order to trick the recipient. That's an increase from May, when Agari researchers found that only Warren was using DMARC to block spoofed emails.

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: A decade that began with the Arab Spring is ending with street protests from Asia to South America and the Middle East.

Violent clashes between police and people across the planet foreshadow what will almost certainly be another volatile decade for geopolitics. The United States will need to contend in the 2020s with the growing risk of war with Iran, plus an expansionist China, a revanchist Russia and deepening cooperation between those strategic foes.

When you widen the aperture, recent demonstrations underscore not just a pervasive discontent with authoritarian regimes but also the simmering anti-elite sentiments that led to Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

The resignation on Sunday of embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi amid sustained protests for sweeping reform has set the stage for a new political crisis as the ruling class scrambles to address demonstrators’ grievances. A human rights official said more than 430 demonstrators have been killed during two months of unrest. Thousands of demonstrators are still camped out in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. This is the biggest challenge to Iraq’s political order since the U.S.-led coalition topped Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Across the border, the Iranian regime is using more violence than at any time since the Islamist revolution four decades ago to repress protests. Between 180 to 450 people, and possibly hundreds more, have reportedly been killed since the government, facing pressure from punishing U.S. sanctions, jacked up gas prices two weeks ago. Another 2,000 have been wounded and 7,000 more have been detained, according to some reports.

The last wave of major protests, which led to at least 72 people being killed, was in 2009 after a contested election. Mir Hossein Mousavi, the 77-year-old opposition leader who “lost” that election and has been under house arrest, released a rare statement on Saturday that compared this most recent crackdown to Black Friday in September 1978 when the Shah’s soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in Jaleh Square, a spark that ignited the revolution.

Meanwhile, in Lebanon, members of the military formed a human chain on Sunday near the presidential palace outside Beirut to prevent violent clashes from breaking out between rival Lebanese protesters as a stalemate over forming a new government continues. Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned about a month ago in the face of protests accusing the elite of corruption and economic mismanagement, but President Michel Aoun has not formally begun the process of forming a new government.

-- In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully in one of several authorized rallies on Sunday were dispersed with tear gas, ending a rare period of peace amid half a year of pro-democracy protests in the territory.

“The march in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side of the city had a clear message: The five demands of the protest movement, including universal suffrage and an investigation into the Hong Kong police, are not to be forgotten,” Shibani Mahtani reports from the ground. “Protesters including the elderly and children, some of whom were carrying banners calling for the end of the Chinese Communist Party, said their fight must go on despite several key successes. Residents voted overwhelmingly for pro-democracy candidates in local elections last week in what was widely interpreted as a resounding message of support for the cause. Those winners now control 17 out of Hong Kong’s 18 electoral districts.”

These protests began in June when the government took up a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, which would have undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy. The government withdrew that proposal, but that’s only one of the five demands. One of the other four is an independent investigation into police conduct. Authorities have resisted any accountability.

Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, endorsed an independent investigation into police brutality over the weekend. “I appeal to the government to take important confidence-building measures, including a proper independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police,” Bachelet wrote on Saturday in the South China Morning Post. The Chinese government criticized her comments as “inappropriate” and said her op-ed would “embolden the rioters.” (The communists derisively refer to the pro-democracy activists as rioters.)

-- South America is facing its most widespread outbreak of popular uprisings this autumn since the Cold War, from the Caribbean coast to Patagonia. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier recently explored the causes: “In Chile, fury over a pocketbook issue — a subway fare increase — has snowballed into a deeper movement against elites and a right-leaning, democratically elected government. In Peru, the street rose up to back President Martín Vizcarra in his crusade to close down a corrupt Congress. In Ecuador, indigenous groups and left-leaning students pressured their government into restoring gasoline subsidies. In Bolivia, pro-democracy and right-wing forces drove power-clinging president Evo Morales from office after his socialists stood accused of stealing an election. In Venezuela, an outlier in the current protests, a starving nation has risen up — unsuccessfully, so far — against a socialist dictatorship accused of destroying the economy.

“But all of these events are taking place against a shared backdrop: the painful aftermath of a commodities boom. Rising prices of the fuels, minerals and crops at the heart of the region’s resource-rich economies at the start of the 21st century helped lift millions out of poverty. The revenue also raised expectations — expectations now unmet in the half-dozen years since the boom went bust. A new middle class fears slipping back down the socioeconomic ladder. As nations tighten their belts in leaner times, the pressure is hitting the poor and middle classes disproportionately, while elites are largely shielded — fueling grass-roots rage. Add weak institutions, structural inequality, political polarization and a corrupt ruling class unwilling to cede power, and you have a recipe for regional unrest.”

-- There’s an inspiration factor at play, as the wind of freedom blows across borders. Though their grievances are quite different, for example, activists in the streets of Santiago have cited the struggle in Hong Kong and adopted many tactics of those protesters. Democracy has been in recession for years now, but the streets are speaking. What will come of the unrest? The truth is that we don’t know how these stories will end, which is always true but still always scary.

-- Recent scenes from Hong Kong to Iran are a testament to the power and possibility of American moral leadership when Washington gets engaged. Under bipartisan pressure, on Thanksgiving eve, Trump signed into law the resolution that passed Congress with only one holdout to offer support for the people of Hong Kong. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters celebrated by draping themselves in American flags and singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Many waved posters thanking Trump by name.

-- In protest, China announced today it will suspend U.S. Navy port visits to Hong Kong and sanction several pro-democracy organizations after Trump signed the bill. “While the nature of the sanctions remained unclear, the move appeared to back up Chinese threats that the U.S. would bear the costs of the decision,” per the AP. “The steps are ‘in response to the U.S.’s unreasonable behavior,’ foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, adding that the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act ‘seriously interfered’ in China’s internal affairs. … Along with suspending visits by official U.S. military ships and aircraft, Hua said China would sanction organizations including the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, Human Rights Watch, the International Republican Institute, Freedom House, and others that she said had ‘performed badly’ in the Hong Kong unrest.”

-- Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign is achieving its desired impact of punishing Iran, but it remains to be seen whether this will bring Tehran to the table or prompt the theocrats who are calling the shots to lash out militarily. The White House announced late last night that Trump “discussed the threat from Iran” in a Sunday phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi, who is fighting for his political life and facing a possible third national election in a year, accused six European countries on Sunday of trying to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. “While the Iranian regime is killing its own people, European countries rush to support that very murderous regime,” Netanyahu said in a televised address on Sunday. Israel’s Foreign Ministry singled out Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Trump is meeting with the leaders of these and other European counties at the NATO summit in London on Tuesday and Wednesday.

-- A front-page story in today’s New York Times has details on how the Iranian government has massacred civilians: “It began two weeks ago with an abrupt increase of at least 50 percent in gasoline prices. Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders. In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos. In the southwest city of Mahshahr alone, witnesses and medical personnel said, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members surrounded, shot and killed 40 to 100 demonstrators — mostly unarmed young men — in a marsh where they had sought refuge. …

“Most of the nationwide unrest seemed concentrated in neighborhoods and cities populated by low-income and working-class families, suggesting this was an uprising born in the historically loyal power base of Iran’s post-revolutionary hierarchy. The authorities have declined to specify casualties and arrests and have denounced unofficial figures on the national death toll as speculative. But the nation’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, has cited widespread unrest around the country. On state media, he said that protests had erupted in 29 out of 31 provinces and 50 military bases had been attacked, which if true suggested a level of coordination absent in the earlier protests. … The property damage also included 731 banks, 140 public spaces, nine religious centers, 70 gasoline stations, 307 vehicles, 183 police cars, 1,076 motorcycles and 34 ambulances, the interior minister said.” (The Guardian also has excellent fresh reporting on the regime’s brutal crackdown in Shiraz.)

-- Ultimately, the repression doesn’t solve the underlying frustrations that prompted protesters to so boldly risk arrest across Iran. It seems a safe bet that there will be more violence in the streets going forward. “These riots are not the last ones and it definitely will happen in the future,” said Revolutionary Guard acting commander Gen. Ali Fadavi, according to the AP.

-- Looking ahead in Iraq, a showdown looms in parliament over who will now lead the fragile democracy. Erin Cunningham and Mustafa Salim report from Baghdad: “Abdul Mahdi was appointed after months of political wrangling in parliament. His departure, approved by lawmakers on Sunday, offers authorities a chance to begin enacting real change, lawmakers and analysts said. Iraqis are fed up with high unemployment rates, widespread graft and a lack of government services. … But parliament — which is made up of rival political blocs, none of which hold a commanding majority — is unlikely to agree on a replacement, some lawmakers said. Parliament has just 15 days to choose a prime minister, who will then be granted 30 days to form a government.

“The leaders of the two largest coalitions — Moqtada al-Sadr, a firebrand Shiite cleric, and Hadi al-Amiri, who is backed by Iran — have publicly split over the prime minister’s resignation. In a statement last month, Sadr vowed never to work toward a political consensus with Amiri again after the latter apparently backtracked on an agreement to subject Abdul Mahdi to a no-confidence vote in parliament. Amiri was a key leader of the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of Shiite militias that was formed to battle Islamic State militants and that has enjoyed considerable support from Iran. Iran has played a significant role in Iraqi politics since Tehran threw its weight behind the militias. But that support might have backfired. Demonstrators in majority-Shiite cities such as Najaf and Karbala have stormed or burned Iranian consulates and defaced posters of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. …

“Even as lawmakers paid lip service to the need for change, they conceded that a new leader would inherit a restive and fractured nation reeling from a security crackdown that appears to have only hardened protesters’ resolve. On Sunday, a demonstrator was killed by security forces in Baghdad as the sides clashed on Rasheed Street, officials said. Demonstrators have sought to protect the vast protest site they have set up in Tahrir Square and surrounding streets, which they have transformed into a mini-republic with art installations, medical facilities, restaurants and free libraries. Police have tried to prevent demonstrators from crossing bridges that lead to government buildings and embassies in the heavily secured Green Zone.”

-- The struggle between lower-case-D democrats and autocrats will persist in the 2020s. It’s a brave new world out there. Effective Sunday, for example, the Chinese government began requiring facial scans for anyone to be able to get a cellphone or SIM card. “The policy is part of a broader push by the Chinese government to limit people’s ability to stay anonymous online,” Quartz reports.

Starting today, an 1,800-mile pipeline is set to begin delivering Russian natural gas to China. The $55 billion project is Moscow’s most significant energy play since the collapse of the Soviet Union. “The Power of Siberia pipeline is a physical bond strengthening a new era of cooperation between two world powers that have separately challenged the U.S.,” the Wall Street Journal reports.

As much as Trump may enjoy the company of strongmen, and politicians in both parties preach isolationism and protectionism to soothe constituents who have grown weary of war and nation-building, the United States remains locked in an existential struggle with the dark forces of autocracy that dates to our founding.

-- Closing the book on the 2010s: It didn’t really sink in for me until Thanksgiving that this tumultuous decade is ending. It’s not that I can’t read a calendar. It’s just that there are so many unfinished storylines. Years from now, however, there will be television documentaries and books that isolate the 2010s as a distinct chapter in our nation’s history. If you could sum up the teens in one word or phrase, what would it be? Besides Trump, what do you think was the single most important story of the decade? Email me at James.Hohmann@washpost.com. I’d love to highlight the most thoughtful answers here this week.

IMPEACHMENT LATEST:

-- White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter last night that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday. Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report: “The invitation from Chairman Jerrold Nadler ‘does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process,’ Cipollone wrote. … Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings but asked Nadler to detail his plans for the upcoming proceedings, including whether he would allow further testimony and cross-examination of fact witnesses, among them those who already testified before the House Intelligence Committee. He also said Republicans should be able to call additional witnesses. … On Sunday, Democrats called on the White House to cooperate, suggesting an innocent person would have no problem testifying. ‘We’re certainly hoping that the president, his counsel, will take advantage of that opportunity if he has not done anything wrong,’ Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) said on ABC News’s ‘This Week.’ ‘We’re certainly anxious to hear his explanation of that.’

“But there is a conflict inside the GOP over the extent to which Trump and his congressional defenders ought to engage, even as Republicans signaled they will continue their aggressive campaign to delegitimize the process as corrupt and unfair. Speaking on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he understood why the White House might want to skip the Wednesday hearing, calling it ‘just another rerun’ covering ground already surveyed in previous Judiciary Committee hearings. ‘This is a complete American waste of time right here,’ he said. But he added that Republicans would be more keen to participate in future hearings — particularly one examining the findings of the House Intelligence Committee as prepared by its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).” Members of the Intelligence Committee are expected to review the draft of the Schiff report today and vote tomorrow (presumably on party lines) to formally transmit it to the Judiciary Committee.

-- Volodymyr Zelensky is stepping up his fight against corruption in Ukraine, despite the risk that he will anger Trump by doing so. Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern report: “By the end of this month, more than 500 Ukrainian prosecutors will be out of their jobs as part of sweeping professional reviews under [Zelensky]. Among the prosecutors heading for the exit: a key Kyiv contact for Rudolph W. Giuliani. The prosecutor purge is just one of several corruption-busting efforts set in motion by Zelensky. But it puts into sharp relief Zelensky’s twin challenges — trying to balance his clean-government promises at home with his needs to keep President Trump from turning against him. Zelensky’s bind is not hard to spot. … Now that Zelensky’s reform push is underway, some of those Giuliani-linked officials are in the crosshairs. A prosecutor named Kostiantyn H. Kulyk is one of the first. Zelensky’s new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka — ‘100 percent my person,’ Zelensky told Trump in July — last week gave a dismissal notice to Kulyk, a key player in the effort to provide Giuliani with political ammunition of dubious accuracy.”

-- Zelenksy pushed back on Trump’s claims about corruption in Ukraine: “If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us,” he told Time Magazine and three European news outlets in a sit-down on Saturday. “I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo.” He said that Ukraine still needs U.S. support to have a chance to get back the territory Russia seized in 2014, starting with the Crimean Peninsula. He said Trump calling Ukraine corrupt makes it hard to attract foreign investment. “When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals,” he said.

“Zelensky has already learned to temper his expectations,” Time notes. “He does not expect his first round of peace talks with Russia, which are scheduled to take place in Paris on Dec. 9, to end the war that has been raging along their border for the past five years. Nor does he expect too much from his Western allies going into these negotiations.”

-- Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers who has kept a lower profile than Giuliani, says he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a New York Times profile. Unlike Giuliani, Sekulow does get compensated for representing Trump. His son Jordan and his law partner Stuart Roth are also on the Trump payroll.

-- Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page spoke to the Daily Beast after two years of silence: “Page, of course, is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory became international news. They were hijacked by Trump to fuel his 'deep-state' conspiracy. For the nearly two years since her name first made the papers, she’s been publicly silent (she did have a closed-door interview with House members in July 2018). I asked her why she was willing to talk now. ‘Honestly, his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel’s back,’ she says. The president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally on Oct. 11, 2019. That was the moment Page decided she had to speak up. ‘I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,’ she says. ‘It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.’ ...

""On Dec. 9, the Justice Department Inspector General report into Trump’s charges that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign will come out. Leaked press accounts indicate that the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump. How does it feel after all this time to finally have the IG apparently affirm what she’s been saying all along? She said she wouldn’t discuss the findings until they were officially public, but she did note: ‘While it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don’t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people. The president has a very loud megaphone.’”

-- Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) claimed that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so. Felicia Sonmez reports: “‘I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,’ Kennedy told host Chuck Todd on NBC News’s ‘Meet the Press’ on Sunday. Todd pressed Kennedy on whether he was concerned that he had been ‘duped’ by Russian propaganda, noting reports that U.S. intelligence officials recently briefed senators that ‘this is a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine.’ Kennedy responded that he had received no such warning. … Kennedy argued Sunday that Ukraine’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign have been ‘very well-documented,’ citing reporting by the Economist, the Financial Times, the Washington Examiner and others. … Despite Kennedy’s claim, there is no evidence that the Ukrainian government engaged in a large-scale effort to aid Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.”

-- The only lawmaker involved in three impeachment probes said Trump’s Ukraine conduct is “more serious” than Richard Nixon’s during Watergate. From CNN: “Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who helped draft an article of impeachment against Nixon as a congressional staffer and served on the House Judiciary Committee during President Bill Clinton's impeachment, [said] that she agrees with [Schiff] that Trump's actions involving Ukraine are ‘far more serious’ than Watergate. Congressional Democrats -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and, on Sunday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- have compared Trump's involvement with Ukraine to the scandal that prompted Nixon to resign in 1974 rather than be impeached. ... ‘President Nixon's misconduct related to trying to use the levers of government to hide the Watergate burglary ... His misconduct had to do with trying to throw the election but at least it didn't involve involving other foreign nations,’ said Lofgren ... ‘If you take a look at the -- what the founding fathers were concerned about, it was the interference by foreign governments in our political system that was one of the gravest concerns. Nixon's behavior didn't fall into that range. So in that way, this conduct is more serious.’”

2020 WATCH:

-- Montana Gov. Steve Bullock dropped out of the presidential race this morning. He was the only Democratic candidate who had won statewide in a state Trump carried in 2016, and he was the only sitting governor in the race. Bullock said he does not plan to run for Senate. Dave Weigel reports: ""Bullock, 53, entered the race in May, arguing that a group heavy on Washington experience needed an outsider from a 'Trump state.' He rejected entreaties from national Democrats to run for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Steve Daines, telling reporters that he had no interest in the job. He affirmed that position Monday. 'While he plans to work hard to elect Democrats in the state and across the country in 2020, it will be in his capacity as a governor and a senior voice in the Democratic Party — not as a candidate for U.S. Senate,' said Bullock’s communications director, Galia Slayen.""

-- Former congressman Joe Sestak is also out of the race. Sestak (D-Pa.) launched his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination about five months ago, Felicia Sonmez reports.

-- Pete Buttigieg is still struggling to win over black voters. This weekend, he used a North Carolina church visit to issue a “moral call to unity.” Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: “The Greenleaf Christian Church is pastored by the Rev. William J. Barber II. Barber’s effort to revive Martin Luther King Jr.’s last major project — the Poor People’s Campaign of 1968 — has inspired a multiracial movement to oppose [Trump], with plans for an assembly and ‘Moral March on Washington’ in June 2020. Buttigieg’s decision to worship with the Disciples of Christ congregation underscored the task that awaits him as he seeks to convince voters that he can credibly lead a diverse coalition to capture the White House. … The 56-year-old pastor pointedly declined to ask Buttigieg about his sexuality, saying he would no more put the question to an airline pilot. ‘But I did ask him, ‘Could he fly the plane?’ Barber remarked, as applause rang out in the pews. Barber was hardly silent on the theme, however. He opened the service by denying that anti-gay hostility was pervasive in the black community.""

-- ICYMI: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is expected to nominate financial executive Kelly Loeffler to the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). The Atlantia Journal-Constitution broke the story Friday, and other outlets have confirmed it. This defies a pressure campaign from Trump to get Kemp to put up Doug Collins, who has been an outspoken Trump defender on cable television.

-- Google and YouTube took down more than 300 video ads for Trump that violated the company's policy. From CBS News: “Lesley Stahl asked [YouTube CEO Susan] Wojcicki, ‘Have you taken down any of President Trump's ads at all?’ YouTube's CEO responded, ‘There are ads of President Trump that were not approved to run on Google or YouTube.’ When pressed for an example, Wojcicki added, ‘Well, they're available in our transparency report.’ In response to concerns raised after the 2016 election cycle, Google and YouTube, like Facebook, keep a searchable archive of political ads that have run on the site. 60 Minutes reviewed the archive to learn more about President Trump's problematic political ads. We found that over 300 video ads were taken down by Google and YouTube, mostly over the summer, for violating company policy. But the archive doesn't detail what policy was violated. Was it copyright violation? A lie or extreme inaccuracy? Faulty grammar? Bad punctuation? It's unclear. The ads determined to be offending are not available to be screened. We found very little transparency in the transparency report.”

-- Another reminder that elections have consequences: The Supreme Court will today wade into the gun control debate for the first time in a decade, making advocates for gun control nervous. From NBC News: “The court has steadfastly declined to take up any gun rights cases since ruling in 2008's Washington, D.C. v. Heller that the Second Amendment provides a right to keep a handgun at home for self-defense, and later clarifying in 2010's McDonald v. Chicago that the right applies nationwide. Now the court's willingness to take the New York case — even though the law at issue was recently repealed — has gun rights supporters feeling optimistic that it could lead to a ruling about the right to bear arms outside the home. Gun control advocates, in contrast, fear the court's new conservative majority may produce a decision that the National Rifle Association could use to fight against many of the 300 local gun restrictions enacted since the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012. ‘What's really on the line is our progress against gun violence and the future of life-saving gun safety laws,’ said Hannah Shearer of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.”

-- America’s divided left is losing the battle on abortion. From the Times: “Interviews with more than 50 reproductive rights leaders, clinic directors, political strategists and activists over the past three months reveal a fragmented movement facing longstanding divisions — cultural, financial and political. Many said that abortion rights advocates and leading reproductive rights groups had made several crucial miscalculations that have put them on the defensive. ‘It’s really, really complicated and somewhat controversial where the pro-choice movement lost,’ said Johanna Schoen, a professor at Rutgers University who has studied the history of abortion. National leaders became overly reliant on the protections granted by a Democratic presidency under Mr. Obama and a relatively balanced Supreme Court, critics say, leading to overconfidence that their goals were not seriously threatened. Their expectation that Mr. Trump would lose led them to forgo battles they now wish they had fought harder, like Judge Merrick B. Garland’s failed nomination to the bench. Local activists in states like Alabama, Georgia, North Dakota and Missouri where abortion was under siege say national leaders lost touch with the ways that access to abortion was eroding in Republican strongholds.”

The City Hall of Villa Union is riddled with bullet holes after a gun battle between Mexican security forces and suspected cartel gunmen on Saturday. At least 19 people were killed, four of them police officers when an armed group in a convoy of trucks stormed the town 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex. (Gerardo Sanchez/AP)

MORE ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- At least 19 were killed in northern Mexico after members of a cartel battled with police and the army at a city hall. Mary Beth Sheridan reports: “The assault started at around noon on Saturday, the eve of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s first anniversary in office. Polls show Mexicans regard the failure to curb violence as the greatest weakness of the generally popular leftist leader. … The attack in the town of Villa Union, around 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex., highlighted how the splintering of Mexico’s top cartels has sparked more violence. It was believed to be carried out by the Cartel of the Northeast, an offshoot of the once-powerful Zetas, which is based in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Several groups that spun off from the Gulf and Zetas cartels are fighting with each other in Tamaulipas and nearby states. The attackers swept into Villa Union in at least 14 trucks, some of them armored and bearing the cartel’s logo ... The gunmen unleashed a furious battle at the town hall, peppering the facade with bullets. Terrified residents shut themselves in their homes as the pop-pop-pop of gunfire filled the air ... The attackers fled after about 90 minutes ... Mexican police and soldiers, backed by army helicopters, chased them in an operation that stretched into Sunday morning ... The dead included four state police officers, 13 alleged cartel members and two civilians kidnapped and killed by the attackers, according to Coahuila Gov. Miguel Riquelme.”

The shootout comes days after Trump said he was planning on designating Mexico’s cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, a move Mexico’s government rejected. Attorney General Bill Barr is expected to visit Mexico City this week to discuss Trump’s plan.

-- Authorities in Mexico arrested several people suspected of involvement in the killings of nine members of the LeBaron family, an extended clan of American Mormons living in Sonora. Sheridan reports: “Officials didn’t provide details, and the attorney general’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. The newspaper El Universal cited sources as saying three people were arrested in Bavispe, not far from La Mora. … Julian LeBaron, a family spokesman and longtime anti-violence activist, said the three suspects detained Sunday were low-level ‘thugs.’ He and about 50 other members of his extended family are scheduled to meet with López Obrador on Monday morning. ‘We think that’s the reason why they went and picked up these local thugs — so these people can say, ‘Yeah, we did something about this,’’ he said. He said the family wasn’t satisfied with the arrests of the triggermen, but wanted the detention of ‘the people who were responsible for giving the order’ to carry out the attack.”

-- Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina. Rachel Siegel reports: “‘Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers,’ Trump said in Monday morning tweet. He then directed his attention to the Federal Reserve, saying that the body should ‘act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies. This makes it very hard for our manufactures & farmers to fairly export their goods. Lower Rates & Loosen - Fed!’ … The surprise announcement came after it appeared that the White House was preparing to dial back its adversarial trade approach in the months leading up to next year’s elections. … Earlier in Trump’s presidency, in March 2018, top steel suppliers including Brazil, South Korea and Japan complained that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative had yet to establish a process for countries to apply for tariff exemptions just days before tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum were scheduled to take effect. At the time, Brazil was the No. 2 steel supplier to the United States.”

-- The victims in the London Bridge fatal stabbing attack were recent Cambridge University graduates dedicated to prison reform. Kim Bellware reports: “Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was identified Sunday by London’s Metropolitan Police as the second fatality in the attack. Jack Merritt, a 25-year-old from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, was identified Saturday. Both were involved with Learning Together, a prison-based education program of Cambridge. Merritt was a coordinator and Jones was a volunteer, university officials said. Jones’s family described her as ‘a funny, kind, positive influence’ whose death leaves ‘a huge void.’ … Jones’s family also highlighted her dedication to criminal justice. That passion, they said, had prompted her to apply to a police graduate recruitment program in which she hoped to specialize in victim support. … Merritt, the program coordinator at Cambridge’s Learning Together program, was remembered by his family as a ‘beautiful, talented boy’ who ‘always took the side of the underdog.’ … Merritt’s family urged the public not to use his death as a justification for the kinds of punitive sentencing he fought against.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his rival Jeremy Corbyn traded blame over the early release of London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, a convicted Islamist terrorist who was let go from prison halfway through his 16-year sentence for plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange. William Booth reports: “Khan, who was freed on parole 11 months ago with an electronic tracking device on his ankle, began his attack Friday afternoon as he was entering a conference intended to rehabilitate violent offenders and terrorists. … Johnson, appearing on a BBC political affairs show, said ‘the reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release, which was brought in by a lefty government.’ He was referring to the government of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, which ended in 2010. … Johnson refused to concede any responsibility. Whatever the Tories failed to do in the past, his government will fix it if he wins a majority in the Dec. 12 elections, he said. … Corbyn, Johnson’s principal opponent in the elections, called the government’s early release of Khan ‘a complete disaster’ and called for a ‘very full investigation.’ In a speech in York on Sunday, Corbyn took aim at the cuts to police forces since the Conservatives came into power — a deficit of some 20,000 officers compared to years before.”

-- Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said he will step down next month, after an investigation into the 2017 killing of a journalist raised questions about the role of his former chief of staff and ensnared other members of his inner circle. Chico Harlan reports: “‘This is what the country needs at the moment,’ Muscat said in a nationally televised address. He said he would resign as leader of his own party on Jan. 12 and step down as prime minister of the Mediterranean island nation of half a million people in ‘the days after.’ The decision was the largest political convulsion yet in the investigation into the car bomb death of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a widely read investigative journalist who focused on the corruption of Maltese politicians and other power brokers.”

-- Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the U.S. must avoid a “hot war.” From CNN: “Back in 1989, the United States and the Soviets were on opposite sides of the conflict, with Washington supporting mujahideen fighters trying to topple the government of Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime. But just over two years later, the USSR collapsed, assistance to the Kabul government dried up and Najibullah's government fell. Asked what lessons could be drawn from the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Gorbachev said: ‘They must be withdrawn. That is the main lesson. You know, it's like a match. The match is lit, a fire spreads. And these clashes, when the leading, largest countries in this conflict become ever more involved, they are dangerous for all nations.’

""The fall of the Berlin Wall was preceded by another pivotal moment: The signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987. That pillar of arms control effectively fell apart this year, after the United States formally withdrew and the Russian government said it had been consigned to the trash can. Asked about the demise of the treaty that he signed alongside Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev expressed a hope that such arms control agreements could be revived. … The ultimate goal of arms control, he added, must be to get rid of nuclear weapons completely. That, however, seems a more remote possibility, given the enduring mistrust between Moscow and Washington. US-Russian relations are now at their worst since the Cold War, but Gorbachev expressed hope that it would be possible for Washington and Moscow to find a way to prevent a ‘hot war’ in the future.”

-- A U.S. drone strike killed civilians, Afghan officials claimed. From the Times: “An American drone strike on a car carrying a woman who had just given birth in southeastern Afghanistan left five people dead, including the mother, three of her relatives and the driver, Afghan officials and family members said on Sunday. The strike in the Alisher District of Khost Province occurred either late Friday night or early Saturday, they said. The woman, Malana, 25, had given birth to a son, her second child, at home. But her health had deteriorated soon after and relatives had been taking her to a clinic. On their way home, their vehicle was hit. After the strike, there was confusion about whether the newborn was among the victims. Later, it became clear that the baby had not been in the car. Turab Khan, a relative, said the boy was safe at home.”

-- Gunmen in Burkina Faso massacred 14 Christians during a church service. Danielle Paquette reports: “Sunday’s massacre follows a string of attacks by radical Islamist insurgents on military posts, a mining convoy and places of worship in the restive countryside that the cash-strapped military has struggled to contain. The assailants fled on motorbikes after spraying bullets into the Protestant congregation, authorities said. … No group has asserted responsibility for the attack yet, but fighters linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda routinely ambush soldiers and civilians in a campaign to sow division, gain recruits and seize territory. … The church ambush in Hantoukoura follows attacks on places of worship that have killed dozens this year in the country’s borderlands. … The gunfire is often indiscriminate, analysts say, but extremists have targeted men for wearing crosses and Muslim leaders who do not follow their rules.”

-- Political leaders and diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks, starting today, for talks on climate change. From the BBC: The meeting “was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. … This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but [Trump] will not be among them. However, [Nancy Pelosi] will attend the conference with a congressional delegation.""

What’s more, the first and third have readily obvious responses. The role of the whistleblower was, by that point, established, the person’s initially reported concerns broadly validated by later testimony. The hiring of Hunter Biden by the Ukrainian energy company Burisma can itself be easily explained: It probably sought influence with the administration of President Barack Obama, though there has been no evidence that his position influenced administration policy.

That second question, more than the other two, has emerged as a central point of focus among defenders of Trump. Over the weekend, Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), for example, reiterated his previous claims that there was something to assertions that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. In doing so, he joined Nunes and many others in suggesting, first, that this happened and, second, this is exculpatory for Trump’s behavior.

Given the primacy of this question about what Ukraine did, it’s worth outlining the evidence that Republicans have pointed to during the impeachment hearings and on social media as constituting Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

Those allegations center on a January 2017 Politico article by reporters Ken Vogel and David Stern titled “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.” The prior month, with questions about Russia’s efforts to interfere in the election swirling, Vogel and Julia Ioffe had documented allegations made by Russia about Ukrainian officials trying to hurt Trump’s campaign by targeting Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman. Manafort resigned his position in August 2016 after Ukrainian anti-corruption activists and a member of Ukraine’s parliament named Serhiy Leshchenko alleged that Manafort had received millions in under-the-table payments for his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

AD

AD

The efforts that backfired were threefold, according to Vogel and Stern. One involved those allegations about Manafort that led to his firing. Another were several anti-Trump posts on social media from Ukrainian officials. The third was an effort by a Democratic National Committee contractor named Alexandra Chalupa, whose parents were immigrants from Ukraine, to dig up information about Manafort’s work.

The DNC operative. Chalupa was mentioned frequently by Nunes during the impeachment hearings and was identified by Republicans as a witness they would have liked to have interviewed. She told Politico that she had been focused on Manafort before his hiring by Trump’s campaign and that she had spoken with Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, and some embassy staffers about her concerns shortly before Manafort joined Trump’s team. She denied any formal investigatory relationship with the embassy but said, “If I asked a question, they would provide guidance, or if there was someone I needed to follow up with,” though “there were no documents given, nothing like that.” Chalupa and the DNC noted that her role with the party didn’t include this effort; she left her role with the party after the July convention to focus on the research effort.

Before one hearing, Nunes represented Chalupa's interactions in a decidedly pointed manner.

AD

AD

“Alexandra Chalupa is a former operative for the Democratic National Committee who worked with officials of the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., in order to smear the Trump campaign in 2016,” he said, conflating a focus on Manafort with an effort to “smear the Trump campaign.”

In the next sentence, he looped her into another aspect of the purported “interference.”

The opinion piece. “She met directly about these matters with then-Ukrainian Ambassador Chaly,” Nunes continued, “who himself wrote an article criticizing Trump during the 2016 campaign.”

That article was published by The Hill on Aug. 4, 2016. It focused on comments made by Trump in the days prior in which he suggested he might recognize Crimea — seized from Ukraine by Russia in 2014 — as part of Russia. (“The people of Crimea,” he said in an interview, “from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.”) Chaly’s essay focused on how that willingness to accede to Russia was at odds with existing policy and the platform of the Republican Party.

AD

AD

Several impeachment witnesses were asked about Chaly's essay. Fiona Hill, a former member of Trump's National Security Council, dismissed the Trump criticism as a “peg,” a way of linking an argument defending Ukraine to something that was in the news.

“I would say that it’s probably not the most advisable thing to do for an ambassador because you never know who is going to win,” Hill said — after being asked whether it constituted “election interference.”

The Manafort dirt. In the end, it wasn’t Chalupa’s efforts that doomed Manafort but, instead, the documents presented by Leshchenko. The New York Times had previously reported that Manafort had received more than $12 million in illicit payments from the pro-Russian party for which he worked, but Manafort’s ouster came only after the actual documents were made public by Leshchenko.

AD

AD

Leshchenko told the Financial Times shortly afterward that he believed it was important to “show not only the corruption aspect, but that [Trump] is [a] pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world.” Leshchenko also said that most politicians in Ukraine were “on Hillary Clinton’s side” — both quotes that were included in the Vogel-Stern article. They also spoke with Leshchenko, who told them (in January 2016) that he “didn’t care who won the U.S. elections.” (In an opinion essay for The Washington Post, Leshchenko also denied a political motivation.)

“I think that what Mr. Leshchenko and others who were looking into the black ledger were most concerned about was actually not Mr. Manafort,” Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said during her public testimony, “but former president [Viktor] Yanukovych and his political party and the amount of money that they allegedly stole and where it went and so forth.” The “black ledger” is a commonly used term for the released documents.

Aiding the Republican argument was a December 2018 Ukrainian court ruling that determined that Leshchenko and his colleagues had, by releasing the documents detailing the Manafort payments, been involved “in meddling in the electoral process of the United States in 2016.” In July, that determination was thrown out on appeal.

AD

AD

The disparagement. In addition to Chaly’s essay, in which he pegged a defense of Ukraine to Trump’s comments about Crimea, the Vogel-Stern article noted specific anti-Trump comments by other Ukrainian officials. A former prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, said on Facebook that Trump “challenged the very values of the free world.” Arsen Avakov, the minister of internal affairs, called Trump a “bigger danger to the U.S. than terrorism” and said his comments on Crimea were the “diagnosis of a dangerous misfit.”

Yovanovitch waved away questions about Avakov. When the Republican counsel noted that he had said “some real nasty things” about Trump, she replied that “sometimes that happens on social media” — a reference to Trump’s attacks on her that morning.

“You know, are you asking me whether it’s appropriate? Probably not,” she added. “But I would say that Minister Avakov has been, as well as others, both in President [Petro] Poroshenko’s administration as well as in the Zelensky administration, has been a good partner to the United States.”

“I would just say that those elements that you’ve recited don’t seem to me to be the Ukrainian — you know, kind of a plan or a plot of the Ukrainian government to work against President Trump or, or anyone else,” she added.

Hill was asked about the officials' comments in her closed-door deposition.

“We found disparaging remarks made by pretty much every world leader and official at different points about the President,” she testified, according to a transcript. “So, you know, this is not surprising but, again you know, and the fact of this was in the course presumably of the campaign.”

In the public hearing, she went further, noting that officials even from allied governments had said “some pretty hurtful things” about Trump — and that she would also have taken offense at them.

AD

“The difference here, however, is that hasn’t had any major impact on his feelings towards those countries,” Hill pointed out. “Not that I have seen. But I’ve heard the president say, and he said it in public so I’m not revealing any kind of executive privilege here, that Ukraine tried to take me down.

AD

“I could list a whole host of ambassadors from allied countries who tweeted out, who had public comments about the president, as well,” she added. “And it did not affect security assistance having meetings with them. If it would [there’d be] a lot of people he wouldn’t have met with.”

Beyond the incidents above, all documented in the Vogel-Stern article, no other alleged “interference” has been documented. Articles pointing back to those same events have been compiled to imply a broader effort, as demonstrated by a social media account associated with Trump's reelection campaign.

Five of the six headlines shown in the above tweet all point to incidents outlined by Vogel and Stern (and include the Vogel-Stern article itself). The exception is the one about “Moscow’s cyber warriors,” which is obviously a report on Russian interference itself that happened to be staged in Ukraine.

It’s important to compare the Ukrainian “interference” outlined by Vogel and Stern with what’s known about Russian interference. As documented by investigators working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a team of a dozen Russian intelligence officers, working directly on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had carried out hacks targeting Trump’s 2016 opponents. Enormous amounts of material were stolen from the DNC and Clinton’s campaign chairman and released publicly through WikiLeaks. Separately, a group funded by a Russian oligarch tied to Putin was working to heighten political divisiveness on social media and support Trump’s candidacy. Mueller’s team obtained an indictment against another dozen individuals as part of that effort.

As the 2017 Politico article notes, the piecemeal efforts by Ukrainian individuals to potentially influence the 2016 election “were far less concerted or centrally directed” than what the Russian government explicitly engaged in. It’s important to note: Vogel and Stern were writing well before Mueller was appointed or any specific details of the Russian interference effort were documented by federal investigators.

There’s one additional caveat that’s important to mention. In his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump at no point raises specific concerns about a purported effort by Ukraine to interfere in 2016. Trump didn’t express the frustration Hill said she would have found understandable about being disparaged. Instead, he requested an investigation into a specific sub-conspiracy theory about the DNC hacking that has already been robustly debunked.

In other words, the briefest response to Nunes’s second question isn’t the articulation above. It’s to note that what Nunes insists on knowing about isn’t even what Trump was interested in."

Goldman Sachs is popping up in some unexpected places — namely, the 2020 presidential campaign trail.

The Wall Street giant is seeking a rebrand by hosting forums for the candidates focused on small-business issues, as I wrote over the weekend.

The bank, through its “10,000 Small Businesses” program, has underwritten six of the events so far in Iowa and New Hampshire — including with former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

But not everybody’s showing up: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) both are declining to participate. “This is exactly what Sen. Sanders means when he talks about a corrupt political system,” spokesman Mike Casca said via email.

Goldman execs say the initiative is aimed at elevating small business issues in a presidential contest that has so far given them short shrift.

From the story:

Goldman Sachs’s executive vice president, John F.W. Rogers, chair of the firm’s foundation, which underwrites both the 10,000 Small Businesses program and the forums, said the events are “about putting this on the agenda of the candidates. I haven’t seen anybody say, ‘Here’s my plan for small business in America. Here’s how I’m going to address the regulations they face, the need for capital.’” “There seems to be a frustration that nobody thinks about the issues that challenge them,” Rogers said. “I hope some of these businesses will grow one day to become big enterprises and do business with Goldman Sachs,” but the firm has no direct economic stake in the program.

But the firm is also using the events to deepen its ties to the candidates, sending lobbyists from its Washington office to greet them. For the Harris event — which I attended in Ankeny, Iowa outside Des Moines — it was Joyce Brayboy, onetime chief to staff to former congressman Mel Watt (D-N.C.) who has worked for Goldman for more than a decade.

“This is the tip of the spear of Goldman’s whole strategy to reintroduce itself to America as a retail bank that cares about Main Street, rather than a global bank that was engaged in decades of illegal conduct that had devastating consequences for families across the country,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which advocates tougher regulation of the financial services industry. “This is one of the biggest banks in the world staging candidate forums not just as brand enhancement but also to put on their best face with the next president, who will be picking their regulators.”

The firm launched the “10,000 Small Businesses” program nearly a decade ago with the goal of putting that many entrepreneurs through an accelerated training in how to improve and grow their businesses. Some 9,100 have graduated, as the program grew from a pilot project at LaGuardia Community College in Queens to 19 locations, including three state-wide programs, and a national cohort. The firm decided to stage the presidential forums after it held a summit in early 2018 for graduates of the program, and 2,000 of them showed up.

Veteran Iowa political journalist David Yepsen, who moderates the forums in the Hawkeye State, said Goldman has no input into his questions. And financial regulation hasn’t come up. But the firm’s involvement is impossible to miss. More from the story:

The event was introduced by Des Moines Area Community College president Ron Denson, who touted the small-business program’s record helping its graduates expand their operations. Then the crowd heard from Elizabeth Hoppe, a coffee shop owner from Emmetsburg, Iowa, who credited her participation with enabling her to open a second location. She also thanked the bank for its “investment in small business and for providing these opportunities to discuss issues that impact our community.” On the same stage, in July, Booker name-checked Goldman’s small-business effort as a model that should be expanded. “That shouldn’t be the exception; that should be the rule,” he said, “because we know the majority of our jobs that are being created in America are jobs being created by small businesses.”

— Black Friday spending sets record: “Black Friday shoppers spent $7.4 billion online, the second largest Internet shopping day ever, according to data compiled by Adobe Analytics,” CNBC’s Alex Sherman reports.

“The $7.4 billion marked the biggest sales day ever for Black Friday and trailed only last year’s Cyber Monday’s $7.9 billion for the number 1 spot of all-time in online revenue, according to Adobe’s data. The average order value per consumer, at $168, was up nearly 6% year-over-year and also set a new Black Friday record. Adobe Analytics measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers.”

— U.S. hold on services economy slips. WSJ's Paul Kiernan: ""Over the past half-century, the U.S. has evolved from an industrial superpower into the undisputed champion of the global services economy. From 2003 to 2015, the U.S. trade surplus in services such as medical care, higher education, royalties and payments processing nearly sextupled to $263.3 billion. Growth has since stalled, however. Exports of services barely rose in the first nine months of 2019, while imports increased 5.5%. The services surplus, at $178.5 billion through September, was down 10% from the same period last year, on pace for its steepest annual decline since 2003.

""Some of the softness in service exports likely reflects cyclical factors, such as a strong dollar or slowing foreign economies. But economists say the decline in the surplus is difficult to pin exclusively on such issues. They point to other forces—some political, others more tectonic—that are weighing on exports while prompting American consumers and firms to buy more foreign services.""

— China wants tariff rollback: “Beijing’s top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China’s Global Times newspaper reported on Sunday, amid uncertainty on whether the two sides can end a 17-month trade war that has depressed global growth,” Reuters reports.

“Global Times, published by the official People’s Daily newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also cited another unidentified source close to the talks as saying U.S. officials had been resisting such a demand because the tariffs were their only weapon in the trade war and giving up that weapon meant ‘surrender.’”

“Huawei’s latest phone, which it unveiled in September—the Mate 30 with a curved display and wide-angle cameras that competes with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 11—contained no U.S. parts, according to an analysis by UBS and Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, a Japanese technology lab that took the device apart to inspect its insides. … Huawei has made significant strides in shedding its dependence on parts from U.S. companies.

Cable internet has high profit margins and growth has been so strong that the two largest U.S. cable companies, Comcast and Charter, are both trading near record highs even as their business is fragmenting. Comcast added 379,000 residential high-speed broadband customers last quarter, its strongest third quarter in a decade. … While 5G is generating a ton of buzz for its ability to supposedly handle the massive amounts of data coming from artificial intelligence workloads and self-driving cars, the technology has limitations when it comes to replacing cable infrastructure.”

Trump’s views of Ukraine — and his demands to investigate the Biden family — were largely shaped by Giuliani, his personal lawyer. The theories and opinions that were passed to Giuliani came from some of the very officials whom Ukrainian activists claim are prime corruption culprits in their own system.

AD

AD

Now that Zelensky’s reform push is underway, some of those Giuliani-linked officials are in the crosshairs.

A prosecutor named Kostiantyn H. Kulyk is one of the first.

Zelensky’s new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka — “100 percent my person,” Zelensky told Trump in July — last week gave a dismissal notice to Kulyk, a key player in the effort to provide Giuliani with political ammunition of dubious accuracy. Kulyk denies meeting Giuliani, but former associates say he prepared a seven-page dossier that his boss later passed along to the former New York mayor. Kulyk did not respond to a request for comment.

Kulyk was fired after failing to turn up for an examination that was part of a review process that will assess prosecutors across Ukraine.

AD

At least 569 other prosecutors also have failed to meet the standards of the review and will be off the payroll by Dec. 31, the prosecutor general’s office said.

AD

Ryaboshapka also has started to audit how previous investigations were pursued against the owner of Burisma, the natural gas company that employed former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter.

But anti-corruption activists say the audit is unlikely to produce any information that would lead to evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden, since no evidence has emerged.

'Hard situation'

Ryaboshapka “is in a hard situation,” said Daria Kaleniuk, director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, one of Ukraine’s main anti-corruption organizations.

AD

She said Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma, “has to be investigated” for alleged self-dealing that predated Hunter Biden’s association with the company, including how Burisma was awarded several extraction licenses while its owner was Ukraine’s natural resources minister from 2010 until 2012.

AD

But a move to prosecute him will be seen by Americans through a political filter, she predicted.

“I cannot imagine anything he can do that would not be interpreted as a political sign by American journalists,” Kaleniuk said, referring to Ryaboshapka. “Any decision will be politically examined.”

Western diplomats in Kyiv say that despite the intense pressure from the White House, Zelensky appears unlikely to give in.

AD

Zelensky “realizes that if he wants to survive, he needs to make some reforms,” said one Western diplomat, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to assess a host country.

“Nasty U.S. politics are kind of spilling over and corrupting Ukraine,” the diplomat added. “And we have a credibility problem because we rely on our norms to be an example. The Ukrainians say, ‘Who are you to lecture us?’ There isn’t the same sort of pressure” as Ukraine’s Western partners previously could bring.

AD

Zelensky, a comedian and entertainer, promised Ukrainians he could finally deliver on the hopes of a 2014 revolution that only partially drove out Ukraine’s old guard. Many citizens thought judges still could be bought by the highest bidder. They hated having to pay regular bribes for driver’s licenses and construction permits.

AD

Now, half a year into Zelensky’s tenure — and just three months into his control of parliament — he has tried to move as quickly as possible in anti-corruption counterpunches, fearful he has only a limited amount of time before his political support slips away.

Ties to oligarch

Ukraine’s parliament voted to strip members of immunity from prosecution. Anti-corruption activists who clashed with Zelensky’s predecessor say they are surprised to finally feel movement within a system that has long resisted change.

AD

But given a long history of dashed expectations from Ukrainian reformers, some Western diplomats and activists say the truest test of whether Zelensky’s efforts will endure will simply be time. And some big questions remain unresolved, including Zelensky’s relationship with one of Ukraine’s richest men, Ihor Kolomoisky, whose television stations helped fuel his rise and who is now demanding the return of his banking empire that was nationalized in 2016.

AD

“Zelensky told me, ‘It’s morally wrong for people to be dying and for all this wealth to be around,’ ” said one senior Western diplomat who has extensive experience in Kyiv. “It’s the first time in all these years I’ve heard an official really talk that way. To be so genuinely appalled.”

But, the diplomat said, the big question remains: “Can they hold oligarchs at arm’s length?”

Still, Zelensky appears to get high marks so far from Ukrainians happy about any change.

AD

“A year ago, I would not even dream that just in a year the main part of our anti-corruption agenda would already be passed by the parliament. So I am very optimistic,” said Halyna Yanchenko, an anti-corruption campaigner who decided to sign up with Zelensky’s Servant of the People Party and was elected to parliament alongside a slew of newcomers in July, days before Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s leader.

AD

Ukraine’s previous president, Petro Poroshenko, was a candy oligarch who had built his own business and was greeted with caution by the activists who took to the streets in late 2013 and early 2014 to demand clean government and European integration from Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych.

Although Poroshenko overhauled the gas sector and made other key changes early in office, he ultimately disappointed many reformists, appointing a series of prosecutors general whom Western diplomats believed to be corrupt and breaking a campaign promise to sell his candy empire if elected.

AD

“If we don’t move so fast, we cannot implement this reform,” said Oleksandr Lemenov, founder of a civil society group called State Watch, who is helping the prosecutor general’s office review more than 1,000 prosecutors in the Kyiv region for their qualifications, case record and any signs of corruption.

AD

More than 11,000 prosecutors across the country will eventually be examined.

“When you play basketball or football, you just need to win the game. 2-1, 4-2, that’s fine; 5-0, you can’t necessarily get. The key is to win the game,” Lemenov said.

'Disruption'

Activists point to a criminal case against the former head of Ukraine’s tax agency, Roman Nasirov, who is accused of defrauding the state of $70 million.

Under the previous system, it took 1½ years just to read out the charges against him in court — a necessary first step in any courtroom proceeding — because of repeated bureaucratic delays. Activists said the slow pace was a deliberate ploy to delay justice. In a new courtroom, under new jurisdiction, the charges took 10 minutes to be read on Nov. 19.

AD

The biggest test will be with Kolomoisky, the former owner of Privatbank, one of Ukraine’s largest financial institutions, who fled Ukraine during Poroshenko’s rule but made a triumphant return after Zelensky’s election.

Privatbank was nationalized in 2016. An audit the next year found that fraud at the bank had led to $5.5 billion in losses. Kolomoisky and his partners deny the allegations. One of his biggest defenders — attorney Andriy Bohdan, who represented Kolomoisky during the nationalization — is now Zelensky’s chief of staff, causing nervousness among the international community.

Lenders including the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have been hesitant to extend assistance to Ukraine while it remains unclear how Zelensky will handle the charges against the man who helped launch his political career.

If Zelensky chooses not to try to recover the $5.5 billion in losses from Privatbank’s former owners, the IMF might be hesitant to commit to go forward with the assistance package it has drawn up, which, coincidentally, is $5.5 billion — a politically difficult sum to offer Ukraine if the government is not seen also to be aggressively pursuing alleged lawbreaking.

In an interview, Kolomoisky said he had no control over the presidency.

“What is it precisely that I got from it? Six months have passed, what are my benefits?” he said.

The Ukrainian central bank, which helped lead the nationalization of the bank in 2016, may not be confident that Zelensky is on its side rather than Kolomoisky’s. On Wednesday it accused Kolomoisky of paying for “hired thugs to forcibly invade it” after media reports that Kolomoisky employees had joined raucous protests in front of its headquarters. Kolomoisky denied the allegations.

“It’s the most disruption to oligarchs I think I’ve seen in 30 years covering the country,” said Timothy Ash, a senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, an investment firm. “I would say it looks hopeful, but there’s this Privatbank thing and the fact that Kolomoisky appears to be untouchable.”

There was “No Malarkey” on Joe Biden’s Iowa bus tour over the weekend, but there was a bit of tomfoolery.

During a stop in Council Bluffs, the Democratic front-runner ceded the microphone to his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, so she could talk about returning to a time when people weren’t embarrassed by the president. Then Biden did something embarrassing. As Dr. Jill gestured widely with her arms, the former vice-president took a small nibble on her index finger.

Partisans saw in it what they wanted. To the Sean Hannitys of the world, it was another manifestation of “Crazy Uncle Joe.” Others, including Pete Buttigieg’s senior adviser Lis Smith, saw it as a rare moment of “humanity and affection” in politics.

Most people just seemed to think it was weird. So they turned it into a meme.

Kamala Harris should have been a contender. In the summer of 2017, the California senator was the toast of the Hamptons and new queen of the Clintonites. From the earliest days of her candidacy, Harris boasted the enthusiastic support of Hillary’s donor network and supporters, warm relations with Obamaworld, and the sympathies of a broad range of Democratic lawmakers in the nation’s largest state and beyond. When Harris withdrew from the race Tuesday, she was second only to Joe Biden in FiveThirtyEight’s “endorsement primary.”

If America’s political parties were still strong enough to anoint their own standard-bearers in smoke-filled rooms (and/or wine-soaked patios), Harris would be on her way to a presidential nomination. Instead, she’s cutting her losses and fortifying her defenses against a hypothetical primary challenge in 2022.

The Democratic Establishment may finally be reconciling itself to Joe Biden. But the former vice-president had to maintain a large lead over the field for months before his party’s donors began moving sharply his way. And even now, significant factions refuse to accept that a 77-year-old white guy who’s rambly beyond his years is their best bet for fending off the Democratic left (thus, we all now know the name of the mayor of South Bend). One reason why Barack Obama tapped Biden as his running mate in the first place was that he was looking for a wingman, not an heir apparent — and the idea of Uncle Joe running for the presidency at age 74 appeared self-evidently absurd. The party’s Pooh-Bahs may settle for an even older Biden, but only if the rank and file leaves them no other choice.

Harris was the one they wanted. She offered oratorical talent, a national political identity still inchoate enough to be remodeled to the demands of the moment, and an opportunity to make history. She appeared progressive enough to appease the left, and pragmatic enough to ease the corporate wing’s economic anxieties. But none of that mattered much, in the end.

Multiple suspects are implicated in Kamala 2020’s premature death. The autopsies began while its heart was still beating: Over the weekend, the New York Times curated the mutual recriminations of her campaign’s warring factions. Whoever was truly at fault, there appears to be little disagreement that her operation was poorly managed. But the Harris team’s idiosyncratic failings can’t explain why Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and other conventionally qualified Democratic candidates have been polling behind her. A separate explanation for Harris’s woes is that, in the Trump era, Democratic voters have developed a more conservative conception of electability than the party’s elites. After the trauma of 2016, perhaps many primary goers feel that nominating an African-American or a woman — let alone an African-American woman — would be tempting fate. But while there is almost certainly some truth to this assessment, it also cannot explain why the two candidates who most violently defy the conventional wisdom about “electability” — the Jewish socialist Bernie Sanders, and female anti-corporate crusader Elizabeth Warren — remain poised to compete in Iowa and beyond.

Thus, Harris’s improbable collapse, along with the failure of Booker or Klobuchar to ever launch, seems indicative of something larger than their individual liabilities — namely, the weakness of modern American political parties as institutions. Booker has won more coveted endorsements than Bernie Sanders, and Klobuchar has claimed more than Pete Buttigieg. But each has mustered only a small fraction of the socialist senator’s or South Bend mayor’s support. Harris’s fundamental problem was that her campaign was rich in a depreciating currency. What looked like the potency of Establishment signaling in 2016 may have actually been the power of mere familiarity: Democratic base voters tend to admire the party’s most prominent leaders, and many are happy to default to a familiar face. For this reason, Biden has managed to coast on name recognition and goodwill. But Establishment support without national renown doesn’t seem to count for much.

In the land of weak parties, mass media is king. Politics Twitter may be wildly unrepresentative of the Democratic electorate. And Harris’s campaign may have erred by failing to appreciate that fact. But her candidacy’s demise reveals that catering to the tastes of the Twitter left is nevertheless perfectly rational. Those bundlers in the Hamptons failed to provide Harris with a steady supply of campaign cash. Sanders’s and Warren’s ideologically motivated, extremely online small-dollar armies by contrast have kept their coffers full. Meanwhile, Buttigieg got off the ground by accepting — and “acing” — absolutely every earned media opportunity that came his way. And in the past week, Michael Bloomberg managed to buy himself the same level of national support as Harris by dropping a recording-breaking $30 million on television ads. In many respects, Donald Trump’s 2016 triumph may prove sui generis. But in demonstrating that media dominance can compensate for a total dearth of intraparty support, the mogul’s first campaign gave us a preview of the new normal.

All of which is to say, the main lesson of Harris’s failure may be this: If you enter a presidential race without celebrity status, unique credibility among your party’s most engaged and ideological activists, billions of dollars in personal wealth, or a preternatural gift for charming white journalists and Iowa grandparents, you are going to have a hard time keeping your campaign funded — no matter how warmly you’re celebrated on Capitol Hill or Martha’s Vineyard."

When Joe Biden turned up in Iowa over the weekend on a tour bus with the words “No Malarkey” splashed across the side, he was sending a message to caucusgoers and his Democratic rivals: No more Mr. Nice Joe.

On Monday the gloves came off, with Biden taking swipes at Pete Buttigieg, his main competition for the moderate vote in Iowa and the beneficiary of a recent surge in support, and Elizabeth Warren, who has dropped in polling but remains strong in the state.

According to Bloomberg News, the former VP invited reporters into the no malarkey zone for an unfiltered question-and-answer session that included Biden accusing Buttigieg of copying his health-care plan, which is centered on creating a public option for anyone who wants it. “He stole it,” Biden said. He also accused reporters of going easy on the South Bend mayor. Biden said that if he had put out a health-care plan that so closely resembled an opponent’s, the press would have “torn my ears off.” He added: “I’d be a plagiarizing no good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.” Biden, of course, has been accused of plagiarism before.

Biden also said Buttigieg “doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderates.” But if Biden’s right about that, it’s hard to imagine why the front-runner would be publicly bashing the 37-year-old Hoosier. Buttigieg has positioned himself as an alternative to Biden for voters who see Warren and Bernie Sanders as too far left, and despite Biden’s protests, moderates in Iowa seem to be buying it.

Biden also hit Warren for a lack of “enthusiasm” in Iowa, Bloomberg News reports:

“You don’t see that with Warren. Stop kidding a kidder. OK, come on, man, give me a break,” Biden said of the Massachusetts senator, who’s drawing large crowds, though she’s fallen from her highs in state and national polls. “Look at the polling everywhere. OK. Tell me. Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself.”

Clearly Biden’s not just done with malarkey. He’s got no time for flimflam, poppycock, or balderdash either."

So far in the Democratic primary, front-runner Joe Biden has had a comparatively light schedule, holding the fewest public events in Iowa and New Hampshire of any 2020 hopeful. But as the former vice-president’s support dips in Iowa, his campaign has scheduled an eight-day blitz across 18 counties in an attempt to secure a win in the first state to caucus. It’s a new day for his campaign, and with it comes a new phrase; or, rather, a really old phrase slapped on a new bus.

Fired up and ready to go for the #NoMalarkey barnstorm! pic.twitter.com/4lpU7waqzh — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) November 30, 2019

The slogan isn’t doing any favors for the 77-year-old candidate facing many critics claiming that he is too old for high office. (Though he is one of four septuagenarians in the Democratic primaries running against the 73-year-old incumbent, Biden’s frequent gaffes are pointed to as evidence of his decline as a public speaker.) The use of old-timey Irish-American slang is unlikely to shore up his support among young Hawkeye voters, though it could be a call to his majority in the state: Only 5 percent of Biden’s Iowa supporters are under 45.

Biden has a long history as the only politician to still use the polite, Jazz Age synonym for “bullshit” “Don’t buy all this malarkey that we’re in so much trouble,” he told a crowd in Philadelphia in 1988 in his first run for president. In a vice-presidential debate in 2012, in response to Paul Ryan’s critique over the administration’s handling of the Benghazi attack, Biden said, “With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey.” And in a 2016 speech at the Democratic National Convention, Biden said that Trump’s claims that he “cares about the middle class” are “a bunch of malarkey.” Though it’s probably not the greatest slogan when it requires the dictionary definition of the operative word to be painted on the back of the bus, Biden’s joins a long tradition of corny bus names on the presidential trail, including Ted Cruz’s “Courageous Cruzer,” John Edwards’s “Main Street Express” and “Daddy Worked in a Mill” fleet, and Mitt Romney’s indefensible “Mitt Mobile: A Five Brothers Bus.”

If the eight-day tour was designed to show Biden at his most politically acute, the inaugural event on Saturday could have gone better. As Jill Biden introduced him to a crowd in Council Bluffs, the former vice-president put his wife’s finger in his mouth.

One of the most ubiquitous reactions to Kamala Harris’s sudden withdrawal from the 2020 presidential contest was this reflection on the remaining candidates who have already qualified for the December debate in Los Angeles:

With Harris dropping out, all 6 of the remaining candidates who have qualified for this month's debate are white. (Biden, Bernie, Warren, Steyer, Buttigieg, Klobuchar). — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) December 3, 2019

Some observers making this factual point (factual at the moment, at least) added a little edge to it:

Harris dropping out leaves the Democrats with an all-white debate stage for December -- Biden, Sanders, Warren, Steyer, Buttigieg, Klobuchar



The Democratic Party has created a process with includes Steyer but excludes Cory Booker.



Congrats! — Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) December 3, 2019

And even this:

Kamala Harris officially ended her campaign today, which means that all of the candidates who currently qualify for the December Democratic debate are white (Sanders, Warren, Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Steyer).



White supremacy is not just a Fox News problem, folks. — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 3, 2019

First of all, it should be noted that there are nine days left before qualifying for the December 19 debate ends, and two nonwhite candidates — Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard — are within a single national qualifying poll of making the stage. So the all-white-debate narrative may well be premature.

Second of all, Cory Booker has been on every debate stage up until now. But his stagnant national and early state polling numbers have not kept up with the gradually increasing but still-low polling thresholds created by the DNC. Like a lot of observers, I don’t completely understand why Booker hasn’t caught on a bit better despite perhaps the most consistently solid debate performances of any candidate. But he hasn’t, so far, and that’s not because the DNC has denied him positive exposure.

And third of all, part of the reason nonwhite candidates have struggled is that nonwhite voters aren’t supporting them all that strongly. The last national poll to offer white/nonwhite cross tabs, a November 21–24 survey from CNN, showed 76 percent of nonwhite voters preferring one of the white candidates who have already qualified for the December debate. One percent of them prefer Booker (Yang does a lot better with five percent). Yes, the preferences of nonwhite voters are constrained by what they believe white voters will accept. But the fact remains that in this and other polls, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are doing significantly better among nonwhite than white voters.

Can the Democratic Party as a whole do more to encourage women and minority candidates to run for office, including the presidency? Sure. But a party organization that has been accused in the past of putting a thumb on the scale for this or that candidate can’t really be blamed for at least trying to defer to popular demand in providing access to the debate stage."

Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky has denied an explicit quid pro quo attaching investigations into President Trump’s political rivals to the release of U.S. military aid. But, in a new interview with Time and several European publications, Zelensky did say that delaying nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was an unfair thing for a “strategic partner” to do.

“Look, I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo,” Zelensky said. “But you have to understand. We’re at war. If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us. I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.”

The denial of a quid pro quo echoes similar statements that Zelensky has made on the subject. During a joint press conference with Trump in New York in September, Zelensky was asked if he “felt any pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?”

“I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections — elections of USA,” he said. Then he insisted that “nobody pushed me.”

Trump quickly seized on those comments in the press conference, jumping in to say, “In other words, no pressure.” He did the same Monday, tweeting this response to the Time interview:

Breaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls. If the Radical Left Democrats were sane, which they are not, it would be case over! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2019

The problem with Trump’s argument is that others have said that there was in fact a quid pro quo, including his own ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. Trump’s also ignoring a key point about Zelensky’s repeated denials. The president of Ukraine has made it clear that he’s not interested in how this scandal plays out in the U.S. He just wants to make sure that his country continues receiving aid. And the surest way to keep the money flowing is to make sure the man in the White House is happy."

The 2020 Democratic presidential field, which added two candidates (Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg) last month, continued its natural “invisible primary” shrinkage as Montana governor Steve Bullock and former representative Joe Sestak withdrew from the race at the end of the Thanksgiving weekend.

Sestak left the contest as he entered it (very late, in June): as more or less an asterisk. He hoped his anti-Establishment persona and strong national-security record (he reached the rank of rear admiral in the Navy) would give him traction. But he raised very little money (under $400,000 in 2019, as of the third quarter), made no real mark in Iowa or other early states, and never threatened to make any debate stage. He came across as a figure from the past, less because of his two unsuccessful Senate campaigns in Pennsylvania than because of seeming like the relic of an era when Democrats pined incessantly for candidates with a military background.

Bullock, a sitting two-term governor from deep-red Montana with a reasonably progressive record, was a different matter. On paper, he had a strong electability argument in a cycle when Democratic voters were obsessed with electability, and as the presidential field first formed, he had some serious street cred. But he fatally alienated many insiders by refusing to enter the contest until his state’s legislative session ended in May. He missed the first debate in June, then had his one shot at a breakout moment in the July 30 debate in Detroit. As my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti explained at the time, expectations for Bullock were high going into that event:

For months now — and, in some cases, years — a handful of senior Democrats have been whispering to donors, activists, strategists, and pundits that they should take a serious look at Montana governor Steve Bullock. Here’s a guy who’s actually won a statewide race deep in Trump Country, an anti-dark-money crusader with a solid liberal record, who could be the non–Joe Biden folksy sorta-centrist voters might be looking for, they said.

Unfortunately, the most memorable Bullock moment in that debate was his argument with Elizabeth Warren about her proposed no-first-use-of-nuclear-weapons position. Appearing determined to keep a preemptive U.S. nuclear strike on the table was not a great look for today’s Democratic Party:

[A]s the evening wound down, his exchange with Warren over nuclear policy highlighted the sheer scale of the task he still has ahead of him. And it reminded his advocates that this world probably isn’t the one of their wistful musings.

And it was John Delaney, not Bullock, who succeeded in hogging attention as the non-Biden-centrist in the race by going after Sanders and Warren repeatedly. That was the last time Bullock appeared in a candidate debate.

He managed to pull in $2.3 million in third-quarter fundraising, enough to run a couple of TV ads in Iowa, the main focus of his campaign. And for his fans there was one thrilling moment when an Emerson poll of that state in October showed him suddenly holding 4 percent of the vote (good for sixth place, ahead of such worthies as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker). But subsequent surveys were deeply discouraging, particularly the gold-standard Selzer poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom in November, which gave Bullock less than one-half of one percent alongside a pallid

24–26 favorability ratio. Whatever Bullock was selling, Iowa caucusgoers weren’t buying it.

One problem Bullock had among the party insiders who were his strongest constituency was the intense desire many harbored that in the end he would emulate John Hickenlooper by dropping out and instead running for the Senate (in his case, against Republican senator Steve Daines). Like Hickenlooper initially, Bullock has long maintained he’s not interested in becoming a senator, as Vox reported in August:

Bullock has repeatedly — and emphatically — said he doesn’t want the job.

Montana’s Senate seat “has never in his life, not once, been a consideration,” Bullock campaign senior adviser Matt McKenna told Vox. “There’s just no way.”

He repeated that demurral as he withdrew from the presidential contest. Buy cynics–or optimists, depending on how you look at it–will point out that Montana’s filing deadline for the Senate race isn’t until next March. Still, it’s more likely that Bullock will quietly end his term as governor next year and consider his options. He’s relatively young at 53. And if Democrats lose to Trump in 2020, Bullock will still be around, still possessing a sterling political record (if you overlook this misfired presidential bid) and his electability argument as his party sorts through the wreckage and looks for salvation."

Kamala Harris is out of the Democratic race. But where does she go from here? I talked to staff writers Zak Cheney-Rice and Sarah Jones about the California Senator’s primary-campaign errors and her future path.

Ben: After months of deflating momentum, Kamala Harris dropped out of the presidential race on Tuesday — the highest-profile departure so far. It feels like both we and other media outlets have documented her problems exhaustively in recent weeks, but now that her campaign is officially over, I’ll ask one more time: What do you think was the primary reason that she stalled so badly after her high point at the first debate?

Sarah: If you asked me to describe what Kamala Harris the candidate stood for in a sentence, I honestly don’t think I could do it. Sanders has a clear message; so does Warren. So does Biden, even if that message happens to be nostalgia. But I don’t think Harris was ever as clear about her values or her vision of reform. There seemed to be no center to who she was a candidate. And I think that was obvious to voters.

Zak: I think it was a mix of not having a real reason for running and doing so in an election where Democratic voters needed to be sure she could win. Biden is leading in the polls because a lot of voters think he’s a sure thing, or the closest thing to it. A black woman candidate and relative newcomer with a muddled vision and no compelling case for her own electability is a gamble they weren’t willing to take.

Ben: In the aftermath of her announcement, I’ve seen some reaction like this tweet from Joy Reid: “The reality is that no 2020 candidate is perfect, but the extent to which people — including the media but also would-be voters — punished and refused to even consider Kamala Harris for flaws she frankly shared with other candidates, was telling and depressing.” There is no denying that Harris’s campaign was disorganized and muddled, and that her message didn’t really break through. But did she get an unfair shake on top of that? Or is there not much truth to this talking point?

Sarah: There’s a grain of truth to it. Harris was hardly the only candidate in the race to suffer from muddled messaging. Nor was she the only candidate to means-test her policy proposals to the point of absolute absurdity. It may be true that compared to candidates like Pete Buttigieg, Harris did receive a disproportionately high level of negative coverage. But she also had flaws that did set her apart from the rest of the field. This was not the year for a candidate to run on their record as a prosecutor.

Zak: Yeah, I think both can be true. Harris almost certainly entered the race with less room for error than her white and male counterparts, for some of the reasons I alluded to above and others that Sarah pointed to. I also don’t think she got an especially unfair shake. She ran a bad campaign, couldn’t get her talking points straight, and has a bad record as a prosecutor.

Ben: Harris wasn’t polling particularly well, but do you think her exit from the race might help any one candidate over another? And do you think she might endorse someone, or will she lay low (which could possibly be advantageous if she wants a VP-nominee slot)?

Zak: I don’t see any immediate benefits to her endorsing. If her feelings about who should be the nominee was important enough to voters that it could shape the race at this point, she probably would’ve had a more successful campaign.

Sarah: If her departure helps anyone, it will probably be Pete, but I don’t think she made enough of an impact in the race for her absence to benefit any candidate to a significant degree. And I also doubt she plans on endorsing anyone right now. Not sure what she, or anyone else, would gain from her making an endorsement until the memory of her very badly run campaign fades a bit.

Ben: Do you think the vice-presidency could be in her future?

Sarah: Maybe! It’s really hard to say right now. Again, she polled so badly that I’m not sure what someone would gain from putting her on a ticket.

Zak: I doubt it. I think she’d have been a natural choice for someone like Biden or Warren prior to running her own campaign. But now that she’s run, and run badly, it’s hard to see anyone still in the race concluding that there’s some vital constituency clamoring for her inclusion.

Ben: Is she the (fairly) rare candidate who hurt her reputation by running for president, or will she be just fine in the long run?

Zak: She’ll be fine. A bad race is a bad race. I don’t think anyone came away from this doubting that Harris has charisma and talent and a compelling profile. Her weaknesses are clearer now than before, but she can work on her overarching political vision over the next few years in the Senate and come back with a better campaign staff and make noise.

Sarah: In the long term? Fine, probably, but I do think her record as a prosecutor is a handicap."

A watchdog group, American Oversight, in May asked the State Department for records related to alleged efforts by Trump and his administration to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, events that are the subject of a House impeachment report released Tuesday.

The Trump administration has declined to release records to the House, as part of the White House’s blanket refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. However, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) empowers judges to order the release of documents requested by members of the public, and federal lawsuits to enforce such requests can move much more quickly through the courts than battles over congressional subpoenas.

“The public should expect more disclosures, over the administration’s strong objection, for the foreseeable future,” American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers said earlier in the litigation.

After Tuesday’s hearing, Evers added, “If I were a member of Congress and thinking about voting on articles of impeachment and whether to convict the president, I would keep in mind that the evidence is going to continue trickling out after I cast that vote, and if the trend continues, it’s not going to get better.”

The group sought records since March 2018 related to the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and readouts from a July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for “a favor” while his administration was withholding military aid.

Cooper in late October ordered the State Department to begin releasing Ukraine-related documents. American Oversight filed its lawsuit on Oct. 1. Tuesday’s hearing focused on the group’s request that the court order the department to prioritize the release of records involving Sondland and Volker, any notes of the July 25 call, and records of Pompeo’s other communications, such as a publicly reported September call with Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.

The suit has taken on added urgency as Democratic leaders have signaled they wish to conclude the House inquiry by year’s end.

American Oversight said an initial 98-page disclosure by the department on Nov. 22 documented multiple earlier communications from Giuliani through the White House to Pompeo “to facilitate a smear campaign” against Yovanovitch.

Justice Department trial attorney Joshua C. Abbuhl of the civil division’s federal programs branch argued Tuesday against a court order, saying that allowing FOIA requesters to change the department’s procedures midstream would substantially tax already stretched resources, duplicate workloads and reduce the efficiency of records searches at a time when the department faces a long backlog of requests.

AD

“It is just very difficult to process documents that have already been” screened, Abbuhl said, adding that there is a “substantial likelihood” that Volker and Sondland’s communications could reflect internal department deliberations that would be exempt from public release.

AD

Cooper said he would wait until Monday, when the department has said it will explain exactly how it has searched for responsive documents and over what period, but expressed skepticism at the department’s claim that it had no readouts or summaries of the July 25 call or the secretary’s other communications.

“I’ll wait to see what the department says,” Cooper said, before adding later, “It seems unlikely there would be no summaries or readouts of that call.”

AD

American Oversight attorney Daniel A. McGrath argued that Volker and Sondland are the “key witnesses” in the impeachment inquiry and noted that Sondland himself testified that the State Department blocked him and House lawmakers from accessing his records and communications that could have bolstered his recollection.

McGrath said even if portions are redacted, the two diplomats’ communications in August and September were “likely to be of great public importance,” explaining what the White House and Trump’s personal attorney were doing and how the State Department responded."

Tom Steyer’s presidential campaign wasn’t born on third base. Unlike some other Democratic candidates, the humble hedge-fund manager didn’t enter the 2020 race with national name recognition, his own journalistic empire, or a multibillion-dollar personal fortune. In fact, Steyer’s wealthiest intraparty rival could afford to buy up every last thing he owns more than 30 times over.

And yet, through hard work, determination, and $63 million in television ad buys, this salt-of-the-earth, single-digit billionaire has earned his place on the Democratic debate stage in December, while Michael “Moneybags” Bloomberg has not.

To qualify for Blue America’s next oratorical smackdown in Los Angeles, candidates had to either hit 4 percent in four national polls approved by the DNC, or 6 percent in two early primary-state polls, while also securing campaign contributions from at least 200,000 donors. Steyer had already assembled the necessary polls before this week. And on Tuesday morning, his campaign announced that it had cleared the donor threshold.

Steyer is the seventh candidate to qualify for the December debate stage, where he will join Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. Other candidates have until December 12 to hit their marks.

Bloomberg, for his part, appears poised to outshine Steyer in their vote-buying contest. Last week, the megabillionaire (whose net worth is estimated at $54.6 billion, dwarfing Steyer’s piddling $1.6 billion) launched a $30 million ad blitz, the most expensive single week of campaign advertising in the history of presidential primaries.

Ads work, at least to a point.

In return, Bloomberg saw his support in national polls more than double to over 5 percent. Morning Consult’s tracking poll currently puts Bloomberg in a tie for fifth place with Kamala Harris; Steyer, meanwhile, is in a four-way tie for eighth with 2 percent support. But the former New York mayor has sworn off all campaign contributions, and is thus incapable of qualifying for any of the remaining Democratic debates, barring a change in the rules. And although Steyer is not registering much in national polls, in the early primary states — which he has inundated with paid messaging — Morning Consult has him at 9 percent, just three points behind Elizabeth Warren."

The House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry report demonstrates in exhaustive detail that President Trump and numerous aides pressured Ukraine to open investigations for Trump’s political benefit. The report describes this as “a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.”

But the effort almost certainly took place over years, not months. Indeed it grew directly out of the ties developed between Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence during the 2016 campaign.

The Ukraine scandal burst into the view of Congress and the public this summer when the House Intelligence Committee obtained a whistle-blower’s report. The report focused on a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, and Trump’s plot to withhold military aid as leverage. But the fact that this sequence of events was exposed does not mean it is the entirety of the plot. The sequence of events instead suggests that Trump has been extorting Ukraine for his own political gain not only in 2017, but during the previous two years as well.

Begin with Trump’s notion that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked Democratic emails. This is the idea he raises in his call with Zelensky, asking his befuddled Ukrainian counterpart to locate a server that, according to this bizarre conspiracy theory, was handed by Democrats over to Ukrainians and that would prove Russia had been framed. American intelligence officials have described the theory as a Russian-backed disinformation campaign.

Where did Trump get this idea from? He seems to have first heard it in the summer of 2016, from Paul Manafort, his campaign manager. Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, told Robert Mueller that Manafort had been spouting the theory that Ukrainians framed Russia since the summer of 2016, and that the theory seemed to come from Manafort’s partner, Konstantin Kilimnik, who American officials believed was a Russian intelligence operative.

By April 2017, Trump was repeating this theory in public, falsely telling an Associated Press reporter that a “Ukrainian-based” company had taken the Democratic server with the stolen emails. A few months after that, Rudy Giuliani began meeting with Ukrainian officials. Giuliani recently explained that he pursued the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had hacked Democratic emails because it would exonerate Trump. Obviously, Trump could not have colluded with Russia to exploit stolen emails if Russia hadn’t stolen the emails in the first place. “I knew they were hot and heavy on this Russian collusion thing, even though I knew 100 percent that it was false,” he told Glenn Beck. “I said to myself, ‘Hallelujah.’ I’ve got what a defense lawyer always wants: I can go prove someone else committed this crime.”

Giuliani undertook what appear to be two previous episodes of trading diplomatic favors to Ukrainians in return for steps to protect Trump from the Mueller investigation. The first apparent trade involved a meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s then-president Petro Poroshenko in return for a Ukrainian investigation that would exonerate Manafort, then a prime target of Mueller’s.

Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake summarizes the timeline:

June 8, 2017: Trump ally Rudolph W. Giuliani meets with Poroshenko and then-Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko.

June 9, 2017: Lutsenko’s office joins an existing investigation into the “black ledger,” which implicated former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The investigation had previously been handled only by Ukraine’s independent National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), and critics alleged the new move was meant to bury the scandal.

June 14, 2017: Reports in Europe indicate Poroshenko will meet with Trump.

June 19, 2017: Spicer says Poroshenko will meet with Vice President Pence, but doesn’t confirm a meeting with Trump.

June 20, 2017: Poroshenko gets a brief “drop-in” visit with Trump.

This is either a direct trade, or an exchange of mutually-beneficial actions that coincidentally occurred in very rapid succession.

The next apparent quid pro quo took place the next year. The U.S. sold desperately needed Javelin missiles to Ukraine that year, and the New York Times reported at the time that Ukraine suspended cooperation with the Mueller investigation. (This is another one of those Trump-era episodes where a credible report of shocking misconduct immediately sinks without a trace into the vast ooze of other Trumpian outrages.) “In every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,” one Ukrainian lawmaker and close ally of President Poroshenko explained to the Times.

The benefit of this move to Trump was immense. Manafort and Kilimnik were key figures in the Mueller probe. Mueller found that Manafort had slipped Kilimnik 75 pages of polling data during a meeting in the summer of 2016. Here you have proof that Trump’s campaign manager gave valuable, detailed information to a known Russian spy, at a time when the Russians were running a pro-Trump media operation. But Mueller never determined what the polling was for. And Kilimnik was able to leave Ukraine and escape to Russia, where Mueller could not interview him. A State Department document concluded that Lutsenko, who had met with Giuliani, allowed Kilimnik to leave the country.

Neither of these episodes has been investigated in anything like the depth of the 2019 episodes. But both bear all the same superficial hallmarks to what occurred this year. In both instances, Giuliani had contacts with Ukrainian officials, and traded the same things (a presidential meeting and military aid). Also in both cases, Ukraine put its famously corrupt judicial system at the disposal of Trump’s domestic interests.

In 2017 and 2018, Trump was consumed by the Mueller investigation, and seems to have pushed Ukraine to take steps to stymie it. By 2019, Giuliani had taken an interest in claims of wrongdoing by Joe Biden, and added demands for a Biden probe to his push for investigations that would exonerate Russia’s (and therefore Trump’s) behavior in 2016.

By 2019, Trump and Giuliani were barely hiding their actions. Giuliani was boasting about his activities to every reporter who would listen. And Trump was directing a growing array of officials to follow Giuliani’s lead, despite the obvious impropriety of placing American foreign policy in the hands of his private attorney who was openly working on his political behalf.

Why did they flaunt their scheme so widely and carelessly? Most likely because they had already been doing the same thing for two years."

Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), in an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Dec. 1, 2019

Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, defended President Trump’s efforts to urge the Ukrainian president to investigate a potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, as a responsible attempt to investigate corruption overseas. We’ve documented before that administration claims about being concerned about corruption in Ukraine don’t add up, given that the Defense Department had already certified Ukraine as meeting corruption targets to receive the military aid that Trump blocked.

AD

But now we are interested in Collins’s assertion that witnesses in the impeachment inquiry had agreed that Hunter Biden’s association with Ukraine’s largest private gas company, Burisma, should be “looked at.” We had watched the hearings and read the deposition transcripts — and that did not ring a bell. His comment also attracted the attention of other reporters. We were especially taken with Collins’s reference to “a massive amount of money” earned by Hunter Biden — earnings that were news to many witnesses. That sounded a lot like the probes that lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) have said are necessary.

Jessica Andrews, communications director for House Judiciary Committee Republicans, said that Collins was not saying that witnesses said Biden’s contract with Burisma should be investigated, only that they said there was a perception of a conflict of interest.

The Facts

As we’ve noted, one can certainly raise questions about Hunter Biden’s judgment in joining Burisma’s board in 2014, at a time his father had a high-profile role in working with Ukraine’s government. It has certainly sparked damaging headlines.

AD

AD

Trump has falsely claimed that the vice president pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Burisma. In fact, the opposite is true — Biden was carrying out administration policy, coordinated with European allies, to press for the removal of Shokin because he was not investigating corruption. In September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt publicly criticized Shokin’s office for thwarting a British money-laundering probe into Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.

During the impeachment hearings, and in earlier depositions, Republican lawmakers regularly brought up Hunter Biden. But they never received any answers suggesting a need for an investigation into his actions, specifically the money he earned as a board member. The best they received was a vague concern, offered by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, about a “possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.”

Kent had disclosed during his deposition that in early 2015, when he was deputy chief of mission in Kyiv, he had had a phone conversation with a Biden aide and had “raised my concerns” that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the Vice President’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family related issues at that time,” Kent said.

AD

AD

Another witness, former special envoy Kurt Volker, would only offer that it was appropriate for the Ukrainian government to investigate possible misdeeds by Ukrainian citizens; he did not suggest that an investigation of Hunter Biden was necessary.

“I think that there is a problem with perceptions of conflicts of interest and ethics for any child of any senior official to be involved in anything that their parents are involved in, period,” said Fiona Hill, Trump’s former top Russia specialist, in her deposition. “So this goes not just to Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden but across the board.”

We reviewed all of the hearings and relevant depositions. Here are the key exchanges that concerned Hunter Biden.

AD

STEVE CASTOR, MINORITY CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL: OK, so Hunter Biden’s added to the board of Burisma. Now, do you think that creates a problem that Burisma may be adding people to its board for protection purposes?

AD

GEORGE KENT, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EUROPEAN AND EURASIAN AFFAIRS: Sir, I work for the government. I don’t work in the corporate sector, and so I believe that companies build their boards with a variety of reasons, not only to promote their business plans.

...

CASTOR: OK, but you know Hunter Biden's role in Burisma's board of directors. At some point you testified in your deposition that you expressed some concern to the Vice President's Office. Is that correct?

AD

KENT: That is correct.

CASTOR: And what did they do about that concern that you expressed?

KENT: I have no idea. I reported my concern to the Office of the Vice President.

CASTOR: OK. And that was the end of it, nobody...

KENT: Sir, you would have to ask people [who] worked in the Office of the Vice President during 2015.

AD

CASTOR: But after you expressed the concern of a perceived conflict of interest at the least, the vice president's engagement in Ukraine didn't decrease, did it?

KENT: Correct. Because the vice president was promoting U.S. policy objectives in Ukraine.

CASTOR: And Hunter Biden's role on the board of Burisma didn't cease, did it?

KENT: To the best of my knowledge, it didn't. And my concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.

AD

REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-N.Y.): But let’s take a first — a step back. The first time you personally became aware of Burisma was actually when you were being prepared by the Obama State Department for your Senate confirmation hearings. And this was in the form of practiced questions and answers, this was your deposition. And you testified that in this particular practice Q&A with the Obama State Department, it wasn’t just generally about Burisma and corruption, it was specifically about Hunter Biden and Burisma. Is that correct?

AD

MARIE YOVANOVITCH, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Yes, it is.

STEFANIK: And the exact quote from your testimony, Ambassador, is, quote, “The way the question was phrased in this model Q&A was, what can you tell us about Hunter Biden’s, you know, being named to the board of Burisma?” So for the millions of Americans watching, President Obama’s own State Department was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping this wonderful ambassador nominee before her confirmation.

AD

...

REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, (R-TEX.): You understood from Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent’s testimony, as it’s been related to you, that he testified a few days ago, do you understand that that arrangement, Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board, caused him enough concern that, as he testified in his statement, that “in February of 2015, I raised my concern that Hunter Biden’s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest.” He went on to talk about the Vice President’s responsibilities over the Ukraine and — or over Ukraine — Ukrainian policy as one of those factors. Do you recall that?

AD

YOVANOVITCH: Yes.

RATCLIFFE: Do you agree with that?

AD

YOVANOVITCH: Yeah.

RATCLIFFE: That it was a legitimate concern to raise?

YOVANOVITCH: In that it could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest.

CASTOR: And are you aware of any specific experience Hunter Biden has in the Ukrainian corporate governance world?

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN, DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: I don’t know much about Mr. Hunter Biden.

...

STEFANIK: You are aware that Hunter Biden did sit on the board of Burisma at this time?

VINDMAN: I am.

STEFANIK: Well I know — I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of the vice president, sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma. The Obama Administration, State Department was also concerned and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests. Every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered yes. Do you agree that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?

AD

VINDMAN: Certainly the potential, yes.

STEFANIK: And Ms. Williams?

JENNIFER WILLIAMS, SPECIAL ADVISER FOR EUROPE AND RUSSIA, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.

DANIEL GOLDMAN, MAJORITY DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS: You understood the relationship between Hunter Biden and Burisma?

AMBASSADOR KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO UKRAINE: I knew that he had been a board member of the company, yes.

...

CASTOR: Subsequent to those facts and the bribe being paid, the Burisma company wanted to improve their image and added some folks to their board, including the president of Poland, including Hunter Biden. Are you familiar with that?

VOLKER: That's what I understand.

CASTOR: And to the extent the Ukrainians, the folks affiliated with Burisma wanted to hire those people for their board for protection purposes so they could continue to engage in misdeeds, if that was a fact worth investigating, you certainly would be supportive of Ukrainians trying to get to the bottom of that, correct?

VOLKER: Well, I can't speculate as to any of the specifics of what was motivating Burisma or not. Ukrainian government authorities investigating possible corruption by Ukrainian citizens is a perfectly appropriate thing...

CASTOR: OK.

VOLKER: ... for them to do.

STEFANIK: Do you believe that Hunter Biden having a position on the board of Burisma has the potential appearance of a conflict of interest?

AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE EUROPEAN UNION: I don’t want to characterize Hunter Biden’s service on the board one way or another. I just don’t know enough.

STEFANIK: So you disagree with every other witness that has answered yes, there is a potential appearance of a conflict of interest.

SONDLAND: Well, you asked if there was a conflict or an appearance ...

STEFANIK: A potential — my quote was the potential appearance of a conflict of interest.

SONDLAND: I didn’t hear the word appearance. Well, clearly it’s an appearance of a conflict.

...

REP. DENNY HECK (D-WASH): You’ve testified here today that you also came to believe that the request for investigations under Burisma was in fact a request to investigate the Bidens, both former Vice President and Hunter. And indeed, the transcript of the July 25 call makes specific reference to that, including Hunter Biden. And today even the Ranking Member said we could clear all this up if we could have Hunter Biden, and I have a simple question — what Ukrainian law did Hunter Biden violate?

SONDLAND: I'm not aware.

HECK: What evidence is there that he may have violated any Ukrainian law?

SONDLAND: I'm not aware.

“Ranking Member Collins meant what he said: People have testified that the relationship between Hunter Biden and Burisma needed to be looked at. At the very least, Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma deserved consideration,” Andrews, the communications director for House Judiciary Committee Republicans, said. “The ranking member didn’t prescribe the who, what, or when of that consideration. Instead, he took his cue from testimony offered by Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent and Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who agreed that the matter needed to be addressed, specifically by the Office of Vice President Biden. Mr. Kent himself raised his ‘concern that Hunter Biden’s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest’ with the Vice President’s office. Ambassador Yovanovitch agreed with Mr. Kent’s action. They agreed that the issue was concerning enough that it needed to be looked into, and Ranking Member Collins heard that concern.”

The Pinocchio Test

The record shows that no witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have said that Hunter Biden’s involvement in Burisma, specifically the money he earned as a board member, was worthy of investigation. But Collins’s spokeswoman says that he did not say or suggest that — he was only referring to phrases such as a “possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.”

We’re not going to put words in Collins’s mouth and so we will leave this unrated. Readers can draw their own conclusions.

The story received widespread attention. In a video uploaded to Instagram on Monday, van Amstel said he had been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, adding, “Josh and I and our son, we did not expect how many reactions we would get.”

An Amsterdam-born former dance coach on “Dancing With the Stars” who now serves as a judge in a Netherlands version of the show, van Amstel has lived with his husband in Utah for about three years, running a fitness program in Salt Lake City. The couple started the adoption process about a year ago and met their son, age 11, earlier this year. They expect the adoption to be finalized later this month.

Van Amstel told The Washington Post that his family had felt welcome in their community. “Not once have I been treated like how this woman treated us,” he said.

The incident happened Nov. 21 at the public school in Cedar Hills, part of the Alpine School District. Students, responding to a question from the substitute teacher, said they were thankful for turkey, their pets and not having to go to school during the holidays, the Tribune reported.

But when the boy gave thanks for his adoptive fathers, the teacher told him it was “nothing to be grateful for” and lectured the class about how “homosexuality is wrong.” The three girls went to the principal’s office after trying — unsuccessfully — to get the teacher to stop.

The school acted quickly, van Amstel said. The teacher was escorted out of the school, defending her comments and blaming the boy along the way. An Alpine School District spokesman told the Tribune that the district has a strict nondiscrimination policy and that “appropriate action” had been taken.

Van Amstel said his son initially didn’t want to tell his parents what happened, fearing it might jeopardize his adoption. He had come close to being adopted previously, only for it to fall through. Instead, van Amstel said, he cried when he heard the boy’s response to the teacher’s question.

MARION, Iowa — “We're going to try something different,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Sunday night. “You all are my experimental group.”

That got some laughter from the crowd, 350 or so Iowans out to see a candidate whose “front-runner” status had evaporated sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving. Warren was serious. Out was the finely crafted stump speech, with reminiscences of her mother putting on her Sunday best (“you all know the dress”) and working to save her family. Out were the applause lines about how “unions will rebuild the middle class” and how the Supreme Court should follow “basic standards of ethics.”

Instead, Warren talked for a fast eight minutes, then took questions for an hour — impeachment, Medicare-for-all, impeachment again, and whether there was a moment in her life “where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn't accept you as much.” After steadily losing support to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Warren was working to remind Iowans why they'd liked her in the first place: She was the candidate with plans. Remember that?

The Marion town hall, followed by an event in Iowa City where she continued the ask-anything format, was Warren's way of acknowledging that something had gone wrong. She would never say so outright. Warren's campaign has avoided talk about the horse race or its plan of attack, even in better days.

Over the summer, when an Iowa poll found Warren leading for the first time, her campaign told staff not to talk about it, and they obliged, a dogma that continued through the year. Reporters who get time with Warren, usually in short gaggles after her town halls, have learned that any horse race question will get a happy non-answer about why the senator is “in this fight” or why she isn't paying attention to polls.

“No,” Warren told reporters in Iowa City, when asked whether she was adjusting her campaign after a downswing. “This is a chance to just talk to more people, and hear their questions, and field more questions. I've been fielding questions since the very first event I did right at the beginning in Iowa.”

It's true that Warren has done this before; it's also true that she's shaking things up. As it rose, Warren's campaign refused to engage with most negative attacks, not even dispatching surrogates for cable TV segments. Warren herself avoided TV interviews, ignored Sunday talk shows and seldom responded to the (often-Trump-centric) news of the day.

There are signs of change, with Warren expected to sit for several cable interviews this week and top surrogates such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts expected to do more TV work as the impeachment drama continues. The Marion town hall produced one of Warren's first viral moments in weeks, when she comforted a member of the LGBTQ community with an emotional story about her divorce.

That was new. Warren's media strategy until Marion had come with disadvantages, exacerbated by her support for Medicare-for-all, which she opted to defend conceptually and funded with a complicated mix of tax increases on the wealthy and employers. Four years earlier, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) challenged Hillary Clinton from the left, not a single negative ad ran in Iowa about his health-care plan, and Sanders did not release an outline for Medicare-for-all until two weeks before the caucuses. This year, attacks on the least popular aspect of Medicare-for-all began six months before anyone would vote.

Over the summer, the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a coalition of insurers, bought half of all political advertising in Iowa. As the leaves changed, Buttigieg and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado both began running ads that emphasized how they would expand government insurance coverage without touching private insurance — unlike Warren, or Sanders. The ads did not mention specific candidates, but the splashback hit Warren, who did not counterpunch unless directly attacked.

In mid-November, Warren partially broke with Sanders with her own transition plan, which would delay the end of private insurance. The attacks didn't stop, and the battle did damage that the campaign knew it needed to reverse. In Marion, she packed her plan for Medicare into three tight minutes: using executive powers to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, using budget reconciliation to lower the enrollment age and pull millions of people into the system, then teeing up a battle with weakened insurance companies.

“I think America is going to say: I'm on board, I get it, I like how this works,” Warren said. “I think that is how we're going to get the most help early in the process, and we're going to be able to open it up. So, it's not about fighting among Americans; it's about how to get health care to every single American at the lowest possible cost.”

One word in that answer — “fighting” — got to Warren's problem. Until her opponents zeroed in on Medicare-for-all, Warren was most strongly identified with her plan for an incremental wealth tax (“two cents, two cents”) that paid for an expansive liberal agenda without asking the vast majority of Americans to pay more. Instead of arguing with any primary opponents, Warren was arguing with billionaires, which she relished. In October and November, she was arguing with fellow Democrats, which she didn't, and Buttigieg flourished by both criticizing Warren's tone and by promising not to get wrapped up in “fighting.”

That has pulled voters away from Warren, sometimes visibly; there were empty seats in a Sunday afternoon event in Waterloo, which drew 175 people in a reliably Democratic town. (Terrance Hollingsworth, who'd organized a summer house party for Warren, said she shouldn't have come to the black part of Waterloo while many voters were at church.) Warren had kicked off the weekend with a rally of around 3,000 supporters in Chicago, which quieted the talk of a fade-out.

Warren's voters were paying attention to the setbacks. At Sunday's events, some used words such as “uncomfortable” to describe how Warren had handled attacks on her policies, though some added that they wanted to see a woman in the White House. (The surprise exit from the race by Sen. Kamala D. Harris has increased the chance that Warren would be the last woman standing in Iowa.) In Waterloo, Ken and Mary Huffman, both 69, were divided — Ken was all in on Warren, while Mary had been dismayed by the Medicare conversation.

“I like what Buttigieg is saying, especially his Medicare for those who want it,” said Mary Huffman. “I've read that there are concerns about whether her plan is enough to pay for that.” Warren's eventual payment and transition plans, she said, had “swayed” her, but not enough to pick a side of the fence.

It's Buttigieg, not Sanders, who Warren-world sees as her biggest problem in Iowa. The Sanders campaign shares that theory, seeing no threat to itself from Buttigieg's more comfortable, college-educated and white coalition, in Iowa or elsewhere. Warren's campaign, with eight weeks to turn things around, is watching to see whether Buttigieg can hold up to scrutiny; while that happens, it's working to restore the image Warren had over the summer as the candidate who could plan for anything and answer any question. It wouldn't abandon the “fight” framing, even as Buttigieg seemed to gain by attacking it.

“It is easy to give up on big ideas,” Warren said. “It makes you sound smart and sophisticated: Just give up on the big ideas! But when we give up on the big ideas, we give up on the people who would be touched by those ideas. Most people are already in a fight.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, who ended her campaign for the presidency Tuesday, was not like other Democrats who'd dropped out. She had 15 endorsements from members of Congress — 16, before the resignation of California's Katie Hill. She'd made inroads with local leaders and elected Democrats across early states. In two weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the loudest liberal voices in the party, was set to campaign for her in Iowa.

That seemed natural, more natural than the slow, brutal collapse of her campaign. At the start of this decade, when Elizabeth Warren was teaching at Harvard and Pete Buttigieg had just left McKinsey & Co., Harris was seen as a potential president, a “female Obama” whose Jamaican and Indian heritage made her intriguing to an increasingly diverse party.

What happened next was a classic political tragedy, a rise and rise and rise followed by a steep fall. Even Democrats who wanted to beat Harris had mixed feelings about what was happening. Harris was labeled a “cop” for a criminal justice record that was dissected for steps that angered activists (an anti-truancy policy that arrested parents, more than 1,000 marijuana convictions) while other moves (opposition to the death penalty that nearly cost her an election) were forgotten. Harris was the first of many Democrats to get whipsawed by the details of Medicare-for-all, and propose some changes to it, which hurt her in ways it never hurt Pete Buttigieg or Elizabeth Warren.

Even some of Harris's setbacks sat uneasily with some Democrats. Her problems began early, with an in-public struggle to define why she was running, and some high-profile events, such as She the People's summit in Houston and the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco, where she gave unmemorable answers or speeches.

But Harris had surged in the polls after criticizing Joe Biden's previous opposition to busing, which ended up showing how resilient Biden's black support really was — a problem for every one of his rivals. Her worst onstage moment came when Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii unloaded on her California record, which turned Gabbard into a favorite of Republicans, encouraging her to go on the attack in later debates. (The Trump campaign quickly congratulated Gabbard after Harris's announcement; Gabbard herself tweeted that “while we disagree on some issues, we agree on others and I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people.”)

By November, Harris was not seen as a threat to the highest-polling Democrats, but her departure mattered in two big ways.

Harris had more legislative endorsements than any Democrat except Joe Biden, and more of them from nonwhite legislators. Those supporters, and some who were staying neutral to see whether Harris could recover, are now free agents, getting fresh overtures from rival campaigns. (One congressional endorser texted The Post about his plans with an emoji of a confused person shrugging.) Endorsements have not driven many votes in this primary, but Harris's included Rep. Barbara Lee, a leader of the party's left who once urged Bernie Sanders to run for president, and an army of local elected officials in California, where no Democrat has a clear advantage.

Harris was also the only nonwhite candidate who had qualified for December's debate in her home state, something that quickly dawned on activists and elected officials. The most diverse contest in presidential history, a race that once featured more women than men, had gotten very white. Two nonwhite Democrats are close to making the stage (Andrew Yang and, in a small irony, Tulsi Gabbard), but Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is not. Neither is former HUD secretary Julián Castro, who was cut from November's debate and was one of the first Democrats to defend Harris.

“The way that the media treated Senator Harris in this campaign has been something else,” Castro told CBS News reporter Tim Perry on Tuesday. “In the last few days, to see articles out of Politico, the New York Times, Washington Post, that have basically trashed her campaign and focused on just one small part of it, and I think held her to a different standard, a double standard, has been grossly unfair and unfortunate.”

Those articles had accurately conveyed the problems that ended Harris's campaign: muddled messaging, uncertain leadership and some scheduling errors that got noticed by activists and donors. But in the final weeks of her candidacy, Harris's stump speech had asked why nonwhite or female candidates were seen as less “electable” by voters still stunned by Donald Trump's 2016 win. Harris would tell voters that she was called unelectable in “every race that I have — here is the operative word — won.” On Tuesday afternoon, Democrats angry that the debate rules, demanding increasingly high poll numbers and donations for entry, had let the wealthy Tom Steyer onstage while excluding talented nonwhite candidates.

“That debate stage currently will not look like America,” said former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan.

“No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic,” said Leah Greenberg, the co-founder of the left-wing organizing group Indivisible. “We need leaders who represent the diversity of our party. The myth of 'electability' and the bias associated with it has done huge damage this cycle.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Amy Klobuchar, “Questions.” The senator from Minnesota's first spots in Iowa and New Hampshire portrayed her as a moderate who could unite the country and calm things down. Her new ad gets into one of the Democrats' most popular policies, using government power to flatten the costs of prescription drugs, without getting into the details. The message is more like the one typically deployed by populists: Drug companies get away with murder, sometimes literally, because no one stands up to them. “Why do drug companies make billions of dollars getting people hooked on opioids?” she asks. “The big pharmaceutical companies, they think they own Washington. Well, they don’t own me.”

Pete Buttigieg, “Welcomed Me.” The mayor's first South Carolina ad is the latest in a series that uses footage from his speech to the Liberty and Justice Celebration in Iowa. It recycles a Bible quote that other Democrats have used, but Buttigieg has really grabbed onto: “In our White House, you won’t have to shake your head and ask yourself, “Whatever happened to ‘I was hungry and you fed me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me?' ” There are more black voters pictured on-screen than in previous Buttigieg spots, but as part of a diverse mix.

2020

Kamala Harris wasn't the only Democrat to bow out of the Democratic race this week. On Monday, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced the end of his own campaign, saying in a statement that he “won’t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field.” To the consternation of Washington Democrats, who had urged him to forgo this race and run for Senate, he said he was seeking no other office.

Bullock had spent more than a year setting up a run, making stops in Iowa for local Democrats and fixating on a simple, consistent message: He’d won three elections in a red state, unlike literally everyone else running for president.

His biggest problem was that they actually started running for president, months before he did. Bullock, a Democrat presiding over a Republican legislature that meets for only a few months, spent the winter and spring of 2019 pushing through an extension of the state’s Medicaid expansion. When he declared his candidacy in May, he’d already missed out on months of organizing and fundraising.

Iowans did not seem care about that, and Bullock attracted sizable crowds in his first visits to the state. But he never broke through in a race in which Joe Biden, despite some stumbles, held onto a pile of moderate votes, and in which Pete Buttigieg had a head start, a compelling pitch — lighter on accomplishments, heavier on inspiration. Bullock’s one moment in the national spotlight, the second Democratic debate, was a missed opportunity, where he became part of a blur of low-polling candidates warning the party not to go far to the left.

Michael F. Bennet. He declared a sort of solidarity with Bullock after the governor ended his campaign, condemning DNC debate rules for leaving candidates like them (who have not reached the donor or polling thresholds) outside. “The fight to win back voters who abandoned our party for Donald Trump isn’t hopeless,” Bennet said. “It runs through battle-tested candidates from swing states, who know how to meet Americans where they are — not where the loudest voices on social media think they ought to be. It’s unfortunate that the DNC couldn’t make room for a perspective like that.”

Amy Klobuchar. She won over Iowa state Rep. Bruce Bearinger, who had previously endorsed Bullock.

Elizabeth Warren. She released a “fair workweek” plan, spelling out new labor rights for workers with variable schedules. Among the rules: requiring employers to give at least two weeks of notice on scheduling, family leave benefits for some part-time workers, and regulations that would prevent employers from taking advantage of those same part-time workers.

Joe Biden. He picked up the support of California Rep. Ami Bera, shortly before Harris left the race. (As noted above, that will free up a large number of California endorsers.)

Mike Bloomberg. He traveled to Jackson, Miss., on Tuesday for a criminal justice reform meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who has worked with Bernie Sanders but is neutral in the primary.

Cory Booker. He's returning to Iowa around this weekend's multiple cattle calls for an expansive “lead with love” tour.

Tom Steyer. He qualified for the December debate in Los Angeles by reaching more than 200,000 unique donations.

ON THE TRAIL

OKATIE, S.C. — On Sunday, in Iowa, Joe Biden told NBC News that he would not get into an argument with Pete Buttigieg. “Anything I say about Pete will be taken as maybe criticism or a negative about Pete,” Biden said. “I don’t have any negative feelings about Pete at all. I think he’s a talented guy.”

Twenty-four hours later, something changed. In an interview with the reporters following his ""No Malarkey"" tour, Biden scoffed at the idea that Buttigieg's ""Medicare for all who want it"" had caught on, saying he ""stole"" the plan from Biden's similar public option and Medicare buy-in.

“What would you have done to me? You would have torn my ears off,” Biden said. “I would be a plagiarizing, no-good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.”

Buttigieg, who has grappled with other Democrats, declined to spar with Biden. Speaking with reporters after a forum with Latino voters, Buttigieg said only that the former vice president was mistaken.

“I've been talking about Medicare for all who wanted since at least February,” Buttigieg said, “and also, the plans are not exactly the same. You know, we've got to focus on capping out-of-pocket costs and focus on a glide path that I think very well could lead to a Medicare-for-all environment. Of course, I believe that our approach on health care is the best one. And I'm willing to bring that plan out and compete with any of my competitors on having the best plan.”

Pressed again on what it meant that Biden went negative, Buttigieg said that it meant “that we've got an excellent plan.”

Biden's criticism stood out largely because it was new. The four highest-polling Democrats are now split, two and two, on whether America's mixed health-insurance system should be replaced by universal Medicare. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren favor replacement (one over four years, one only after Medicare is expanded to a near-universal program), and had scrapped with both Biden and Buttigieg. And Buttigieg still has more of an argument with the liberal senators; asked whether his plan would cover noncitizens, as Medicare-for-all does, he said it was more complicated.

“I do think that everybody should be eligible to buy in to Medicare for all who wanted the public plan,” Buttigieg said. “But I would expect that you'd have to be a citizen to qualify for subsidies.”

AD

The report’s new argument is that, yes, Trump might have made requests of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce “investigations” that would validate Trump’s (invented) theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and his (fabricated) narrative of corruption on the part of Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine.

AD

But, Republicans say, Trump was right to do this, because his concerns about these things were legitimate and were subsumed into a much broader — and, again, legitimate — set of concerns about corruption.

The argument is a joke. But it also illustrates in a backhand way just how unconvincing any effort to sanitize away Trump’s corrupt motives must inevitably be.

AD

The GOP argument requires ignoring voluminous evidence of those corrupt motives. It also requires accepting the spectacularly absurd idea that the investigations Trump actually did ask for were not just motivated by a general desire to fight corruption but also benefited Trump politically out of pure coincidence.

The narcissism defense

The report’s argument is that Trump didn’t baldly condition official acts (a White House meeting; hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid) on getting Zelensky to announce those investigations. But it was legitimate for Trump to hesitate in granting them, because his request for those investigations was reasonable.

AD

AD

To buttress this, the report claims Trump holds a “deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism” of Ukraine’s “history of pervasive corruption.” This means Trump’s “hesitation” to grant the meeting and military aid was “entirely prudent.”

The report selectively quotes testimony that Trump saw Ukraine as a corrupt country. But then the report brazenly cites Trump’s concerns about Ukrainians opposing him in the 2016 election as grounds for Trump’s dim views of Ukraine!

The report cites cherry-picked facts to suggest those concerns were legitimate. But as Glenn Kessler has shown, the full body of known facts doesn’t come remotely close to demonstrating the sort of state-level effort by Ukraine to interfere in our election that Russia actually did mount.

AD

That aside, this aspect of the report is a spectacular self own. It actually shows that for Trump, the view of Ukraine as corrupt was long hopelessly entangled with his theory that Ukraine tried to block him from winning in 2016.

AD

We know from careful reporting in The Post that this is exactly what shaped Trump’s views: In May, Trump was already privately ranting about Ukraine’s effort to “take me down,” and that this suffused his view of Ukraine as “corrupt.” Trump’s own former Homeland Security chief has said Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani regularly filled Trump’s head with this line of nonsense, agitating him.

Call it the narcissism defense: Trump genuinely persuaded himself that Ukraine had interfered in our election to harm him, which makes his concerns about undefined Ukrainian corruption legitimate. (Some Republicans are gravitating toward saying this crackpot theory is true, which is worse.)

AD

Trump had corrupt motives and still does

In the real world, the evidence that Trump didn’t care about generic corruption — and that he was advancing his own corrupt interests above all — is overwhelming. As early as May, Giuliani publicly announced his pressure campaign on Ukraine, explicitly saying Ukraine must investigate the 2016 Ukraine and Biden theories, and not because of generic corruption, but because this would be “very helpful” to Trump.

AD

The president himself told Zelensky on their July 25 call that Giuliani was acting at his direction in carrying out this whole scheme. On that call, Trump explicitly demanded those two investigations, not an investigation of generic corruption. Those released texts showed Giuliani, Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Ukrainian officials negotiating a statement announcing those investigations in particular.

AD

Sondland explicitly testified that the meeting was dangled to leverage those investigations, that he personally informed a top Zelensky aide that the military aid was also conditional on them and that he was acting at Trump’s direction all throughout.

We don’t even need to prove Trump himself explicitly drew that latter link. Trump’s extortion demands — and Sondland’s and Giuliani’s, carried out at Trump’s direction — are a matter of public record, and by themselves, they are deeply saturated in corrupt motives.

AD

After all, the investigation into the 2016 Ukraine theory stood to benefit Trump politically, because it would help absolve Russia of its own 2016 sabotage of our election for Trump — and make Trumpworld’s eager efforts to coordinate with and benefit from it disappear, making another round of it easier.

AD

The investigation into Biden, of course, stood to benefit Trump politically for more obvious reasons. Yet the GOP report claims concerns about Biden’s corruption were reasonable.

That’s nonsense on its face, but more to the point, it’s self-undermining. In both these cases, the GOP argument requires us to believe Trump was legitimately concerned with corruption, while also believing the two investigations he actually did demand both stood to benefit him politically only out of pure coincidence.

AD

It’s an awful argument. But if Republicans really want a debate about whether Trump was and is operating out of profoundly corrupt motives, it’s one Democrats should lean into hard.

Cipollone’s letter, like many documents produced by the president’s private lawyers and government lawyers alike, is written in a Trumpian tone, full of preposterous assertions and childish whining, as though the authors were laboring to channel the president’s distinctive rhetorical style. Its central argument is that the president’s rights have been violated, citing “the complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness afforded the President throughout this purported impeachment inquiry.”

Purported? I’d invite any criminal defendant to walk into court and proclaim, “I refuse to participate in this purported trial!” and see how that works out for them.

Of course, impeachment is not precisely like a criminal proceeding, though it has some parallels. In particular, this phase of the process is where the president has the opportunity to mount his own defense. Yet it appears he may choose not to.

Which isn’t all that surprising, because at this point it’s hard to see what brilliant defense Trump might have up his sleeve. In the Intelligence Committee hearings, we saw what the Republican defense of Trump would look like. They had an opportunity for their counsel to cross-examine witnesses at length. They had Republican members present their best arguments for Trump’s innocence. They had Rep. Jim Jordan do his exasperated-shouting routine. They had Rep. Devin Nunes deliver speeches mixing bizarre claims with debunked conspiracy theories. They gave it everything they had.

AD

AD

And what did it amount to? Did they puncture any of the claims against the president? Did they show the witnesses to be liars conspiring against him? Did they produce dramatic new evidence showing that in fact everything Trump did was to serve not his own interests but those of the country?

No, they did not. So if given every bit of “due process” they could want, what would they come up with now? Are there fact witnesses who can prove Trump’s innocence who have to this point been silent? Who might that be? They can call Hunter Biden in to yell at him for a few hours, but what will that change about what Trump did?

Let’s not forget how clear and unambiguous the case for Trump’s wrongdoing is. We have the rough transcript of his phone call with President Zelensky, in which he responds to Zelensky’s expressed desire for military aid by urging him to investigate Joe Biden. We have Trump’s own statement on the White House lawn, when asked what he wanted from Ukraine: “It’s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens.” We have the acting chief of staff’s statement that yes, there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine, and we all need to “get over it.”

AD

AD

We have the testimony of witness after witness from within the Trump administration, explaining how the president turned over Ukraine policy to Rudy Giuliani, who has been publicly vocal about pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden to help Trump’s reelection. We have lengthy testimony on how important it was to Giuliani and Trump that the Ukrainians make a public show of launching such an investigation.

There are a couple of ways Republicans can spin all those facts. They can argue, as they now appear to be doing, that while Trump did everything he is accused of, all his actions were in fact just peachy. Or they can admit, as a few have, that while it wasn’t appropriate to do what Trump did, but then say his misdeeds don’t rise to the level of impeachment and removal.

But you don’t need a bunch of White House lawyers to do that. The minority members of the Judiciary Committee (among them such intellectual heavyweights as Jordan, Texas’s Louie Gohmert and Florida’s Matt Gaetz) are perfectly capable of yelling at witnesses to produce clips to replay on the evening’s episode of “Hannity.” That’s all the defense Trump wants or needs.

AD

AD

As any parent knows, children between the ages of about 3 and 7 will cry “Unfair!” whenever anything doesn’t go their way. The president seems never to have progressed beyond that stage of development, and so his White House has adopted that cry as their strategy for dealing with impeachment. As long as all they want is to keep the Fox News audience loyal to him, and thereby keep Republicans in Congress too afraid to cross the party’s base despite the facts, it’s a strategy that could work.

The South Bend, Ind., mayor's eight-page proposal pledged to even the playing field for minorities who typically have worse access to medical providers and much higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic health conditions compared with white Americans.

Buttigieg has surged in the polls to lead the Democratic primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. But he’s in trouble in subsequent primaries in Nevada and South Carolina, where strong support from African American voters has given former vice president Joe Biden a strong lead.

Buttigieg has been criticized for his handling of racially-charged incidents within his city’s police department and has only a smattering of endorsements from black or Hispanic elected officials. That could be a huge stumbling block for his campaign, considering no Democrat in the last three decades has secured the party's nomination without a majority of black support.

Even the Onion has mocked Buttigieg’s struggles:

Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote https://t.co/f0DQKE6XhZ pic.twitter.com/Q117k4MfZb — The Onion (@TheOnion) December 2, 2019

Buttigieg is hoping to help correct this problem with promises to make the health of minorities — both through direct medical care and indirect aspects such as housing, food, education and access to clean water — a top priority.

He promises that in his first 100 days as president his administration would develop a “National Health Equity Strategy.” He also vows to help particular geographic areas combat the worst disparities and to support programs to train the health-care workforce to overcome racial bias when treating patients.

The disparities are particularly stark when it comes to life expectancy. A black man living in a rural community is likely to live seven years less than a white man living in a city. Black life expectancy at birth is about three and a half years lower than that of whites. The mortality gap between black and white Americans been cut in half since 1999, but the United States still has a long way to go before it’s eliminated.

“Millions of Americans today still find their health determined by who they are or where they live,” the paper says. “Systemic discrimination takes the form of a doctor who takes a Black person’s pain symptoms less seriously … it manifests in a hospital system that breaks ground only in a predominantly white neighborhood.”

The paper also calls for improvements in black maternal health, an area that has recently undergone increased scrutiny as celebrities including Beyoncé and Serena Williams have spoken out about their own struggles with pregnancy and childbirth. Black women are three to four times as likely to be at risk of pregnancy-related deaths as white women, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

It’s hard to overstate Buttigieg’s need to inspire confidence among black voters in particular. They’re only a tiny sliver of the electorate in the earliest primary states, but they’re much larger voting blocs in nearly every primary that comes after. Minorities comprise more than one-third of Democratic voters in the 16 states with primaries on March 3, known as “Super Tuesday.”

For now, Buttigieg is focusing on South Carolina. He’ll meet with Latino community leaders and locals in Okatie, S.C., at noon today to discuss health equity, a spokeswoman said. On Sunday, the mayor attended services at a church led by the Rev. William J. Barber II, who revived a campaign originally started by Martin Luther King Jr. to combat economic inequality.

Afterward, Buttigieg told reporters that he believes he is making progress with black voters, including those “who may yet not feel that they know me,” per the Associated Press.

“Part of what I’m trying to do is talk about these issues, including specific racial issues around voter suppression and systemic racism, in a way that helps everyone in the country understand why we all have a stake in dealing with it,” Buttigieg said.

The campaign is opening four offices and hiring 40 staffers in the state. The campaign launched its first ad there yesterday, spending $2 million on a spot that features the mayor listening to a racially diverse group of voters.

The ad:

By releasing yet another health-care proposal among the many coming out of his campaign over the last few months, he seems to be adopting the sort of “plan for everything” style his opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was first known for.

One of his other proposals is “Medicare for all who want it,” which would retain employer-sponsored coverage while allowing anyone to buy a public plan if they preferred. The approach, which the mayor rolled out over the summer, is strikingly similar to the public option plan championed by Biden — so much so, that Biden accused Buttigieg yesterday of stealing his idea.

“[Buttigieg] doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderate — moderate plan,” Biden said in an interview with Politico. “It’s the Biden plan.”

My colleague Matt Viser:

Biden says Buttigieg stole his heath care plan — and the media isn’t tough enough on him for it.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

(Susan Walsh/AP)

AHH: Three state lawmakers published op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all that were written with the help of lobbyists that either wrote drafts or made extensive edits, our Washington Post colleague Jeff Stein reports, citing emailed obtained by The Post.

Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) said op-eds they wrote about single-payer health proposals included language from lobbyist and consultant John MacDonald. Meanwhile, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) told The Post the lawmaker published an op-ed with assistance from lobbyist Kathleen Deland.

“None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist,” Jeff writes. “The emails show how, even at the state and local levels, lobbyists are trying to bend public opinion away from an idea that has seized much of the debate during the current Democratic presidential primary. … The documents were provided to The Post by the nonprofit advocacy group Medicare for All Now, which supports the single-payer system. The group obtained the documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.”

Jeff adds that neither of the consultants would say whether they had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a group that’s spent more than $1 million on ads warning against Medicare-for-all and other overhauls to the nation’s health-care system. A spokesman for the group also wouldn’t confirm or deny having hired MacDonald or Deland.

OOF: The stigma of addiction and criminal activity related to opioid abuse remains a barrier for victims seeking damages, our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports, citing alleged victims, plaintiff lawyers and legal specialists.

“Prescription opioid abusers often are perceived to share the blame for the serious harm they experienced through addiction to prescription pills, recovering users contend,” he writes. “Unlike those injured by asbestos, medical implants or faulty automobile bags, courts have been reluctant to accept their claim that their addiction was the result of a dangerous, improperly marketed product.”

Christopher writes the settlement reached between OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and Oklahoma directed $200 million to the University of Oklahoma for a research and addiction treatment program, with another $12 million to local governments and $60 million for legal expenses.

“None of the settlement money was earmarked directly for victim compensation,” he writes. “Victim-compensation funds also have not yet been floated as part of the national-level settlements being negotiated by governments and manufacturers. The most tangible benefit for victims so far has been proposals for free anti-addiction and overdose-rescue drugs to individual communities.”

OUCH: About a fifth of adolescents ages 12 to 18 in the United States are now prediabetic, as are nearly a quarter of young adults ages 19 to 34, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The data found the rising rate of young people who are prediabetic, meaning their blood sugar levels are elevated but not quite high enough to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, means the age groups are at risk for developing the condition, CNN’s Michael Nedelman writes.

“Until recently, young children and teens almost never got type 2 diabetes, which is why it used to be called adult-onset diabetes,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Now, about one-third of American youth are overweight, a problem closely related to the increase in kids with type 2 diabetes, some as young as 10 years old.”

“Prediabetes was also more common among young people with obesity, which is also closely linked to Type 2 diabetes in adults. More than a quarter of obese adolescents and more than a third of obese young adults were found to have prediabetes — versus less than 17% of individuals with normal weight in both age groups,” Michael writes.

HEALTH ON THE HILL

— A bicameral group of Democrats have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that would require doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced the brief that includes 161 House Democrats and 36 Senate Democrats.

“Lawmakers said the case still represents a direct challenge to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, even though Louisiana and its supporters have not asked the Court to formally overturn Roe,” the Hill’s Nathaniel Weixel reports. “The Democrats said upholding Louisiana’s law would allow states to effectively eliminate abortion.”

“While Act 620 purports to improve women’s health and safety, the law will actually make it more difficult for women in Louisiana to obtain safe medical care,” the lawmakers wrote. “As with other statutes targeting abortion providers and facilities, the actual legislative intent here is to mandate requirements so difficult to fulfill that the inevitable outcome is the shuttering of abortion clinics and elimination of safe and legal abortions. Indeed, if Act 620 goes into effect, Louisiana will have only a single clinic providing abortion services in the entire state.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments for the case in March.

— Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) wants state lawmakers to work with her to halt the implementation of the state’s Medicaid work requirements amid concerns that people will lose health coverage, MLive.com’s Malachi Barrett reports.

“Starting next year, most able-bodied adults between the ages of 19-61 who are enrolled in Michigan’s Medicaid expansion will have to work an average of 20 hours per week or 80 hours per month,” Malachi writes. “Whitmer said pausing the ‘punitive’ requirements is the ‘most reasonable thing’ to prevent people from losing health care coverage.”

A coalition of state and national health groups last month filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop Michigan from implementing its work rules. Other legal challenges have been filed against work requirements in Kentucky, Arkansas and New Hampshire, as well as in Indiana, which said it would pause its requirements until the case is resolved.

She seemed like a potentially great candidate: a strong résumé of positions at the local, state, and federal levels; a base in the country’s most populous state; evident charisma. But she was never able to persuade significant numbers of voters to support her.

AD

There are a number of reasons to which you could point to explain her difficulties. According to reports, her campaign was hampered by disorganization and mismanagement. Her fundraising couldn’t keep pace with that of other candidates such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She struggled with questions about her record as a prosecutor and her health-care plan (which was perfectly reasonable but didn’t slot neatly into the public option vs. Medicare-for-all conflict to which the debate is often reduced). It’s also hard to say whether her race and gender hurt her ability to amass support, and if so, how much.

One problem, though, stands out: As appealing as she may have been in many ways, Harris was never able to explain why she was running for president. It’s an answer you’d expect every candidate to know long before they make their announcement speech, but a surprising number of them don’t. The winner, though, almost always does.

Of course, we know that the real answer for every candidate, at least in part, is “I’m running for president because I want to be president.” If you think even highly ideological candidates such as Sanders aren’t fiercely ambitious, you’re fooling yourself.

AD

AD

But to stand the best chance at success, a presidential campaign has to be about something. Joe Biden is running to reset the clock to four years ago and restore civility and reason to our politics, his own version of “Make America Great Again.” Warren is running to end corruption and take power away from the plutocrats warping the system for their own ends. But why was Harris running? She never told us, at least not in a way that was clear and concise enough for voters to grasp.

To be clear, there are candidates still in the race who still haven’t told us. And as much as I hesitate to say they should pander to our ""10-second sound bite” culture, it’s not an unreasonable thing to demand that candidates should be able to communicate in a sentence or two what their candidacy represents. It’s particularly important during a primary when the policy distinctions between the candidates are relatively small compared with what they will be in the general election. Voters have to know who the candidates are, but they also have to know what voting for you says about them.

Like many, I’m sorry to see Harris leave the race (though she’ll be around for some time; she’s only 55). It’s particularly disconcerting that she was the only nonwhite candidate to have qualified for the next debate; an all-white debate is not exactly a good look for the party where most nonwhite voters reside.

106,Aaron Blake,"'Tis a new season in the impeachment inquiry: Actual impeachment

“There is also nothing wrong with asking serious questions about the presence of Vice President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, on the board of directors of Burisma, a corrupt Ukrainian company, or about Ukraine’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Biden’s Burisma has an international reputation as a corrupt company. As far back as 2015, the Obama State Department had concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board.”

AD

AD

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this report is that, in its 123 pages, it makes almost no mention of the conspiracy theory that Trump actually broached on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: that the elder Biden was seeking to help his son by removing a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.

The above paragraph, from the introductory summary, is a great example. It pretends Trump was really just asking questions about Burisma. And that’s a common thread through the report.

Indeed, the one example I could find of a reference to the former vice president’s actions is here, and it doesn’t even ascribe the theory to Trump:

AD

In addition to Burisma, there are questions about why the Ukrainian government fired then-Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin — according to Vice President Biden, at his insistence — when it did not fire his successor, Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko. Although Shokin and Lutsenko were both seen by State Department officials as corrupt and ineffective prosecutors, there was no effort to remove Lutsenko to the same degree or in the same way as there was with Shokin.

To be clear, Trump said on his call with Zelensky, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

AD

Trump doesn’t even raise a concern about Burisma’s alleged corruption; he’s interested only in Joe Biden’s actions.

The report makes almost no effort to vouch for the latter — apparently because it would be clear that Trump was trying to damage his potential 2020 opponent. The report, at several other points, argues that there is no evidence that Trump was trying to help himself win reelection, against all logic.

AD

“The evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats’ witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor.”

The witnesses thus far were “fact witnesses” — not experts in criminal law. What’s more, many of them said explicitly that they weren’t there to make legal judgments or weigh in for or against impeachment.

AD

“I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other,” the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., testified, “or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them about the incidents in question as well as my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States.”

AD

At one point, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) asked Taylor and top State Department official George Kent, “Where is the impeachable offense in that call? Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?”

Taylor reminded Ratcliffe that he wasn’t there to make such determinations, and Ratcliffe withdrew the question. Apparently the GOP isn’t withdrawing the argument, though.

AD

“Understood in this proper context, the president’s initial hesitation to meet with President Zelensky or to provide U.S. taxpayer-funded security assistance to Ukraine without thoughtful review is entirely prudent.”

The argument has long been that Ukraine is indeed a corrupt country, so why not hold off on making concessions until we can ensure things are headed in the right direction?

AD

But even if we ignore the fact that the only investigations Trump has asked for are ones that carry personal benefits for him, there’s also this: There already was a “thoughtful review” of Ukraine’s anti-corruption measures, and Ukraine passed it. It came from the Defense Department, which concluded in May that Ukraine had made sufficient progress on corruption to merit the aid. And even after Trump held up the funds, it’s not clear that any official review took place.

AD

What’s more, if this was the true reason for the hold, nobody seemed to want to say it, including within the Trump administration, for reasons that simply aren’t clear.

“President Trump then released security assistance to Ukraine and met with President Zelensky in September 2019 — all without Ukraine taking any action to investigate President Trump’s political rival. … The Democrats’ impeachment narrative ignores Ukraine’s dramatic transformation in its fight against endemic corruption. President Trump was skeptical of Ukrainian corruption and his Administration sought proof that newly-elected President Zelensky was a true reformer. And after winning a parliamentary majority, the new Zelensky administration took rapid strides to crack down on corruption. Several high-level U.S. officials observed firsthand these anticorruption achievements in Kyiv, and the security assistance was released soon afterward.”

AD

First of all, it’s true that Trump met with Zelensky — but only at the United Nations and not at the White House, as Zelensky had sought.

AD

What’s more, both that and the release of the military aid came after the scandal began emerging in public — and, in the case of the military aid, after Trump was getting bipartisan pressure to release it.

Whether Trump actually did something impeachable is a valid question about which people can disagree, but the idea that Trump giving Zelensky what he wanted means this was all on the up-and-up doesn’t really make sense. If a bank robber gives up on his plot because he sees the police coming, does that mean he didn’t try to rob the bank?

This week, the House Judiciary Committee will move toward drafting articles of impeachment after the Intelligence Committee releases its own report on Trump’s corrupt efforts to extort Ukraine into announcing investigations to benefit his reelection campaign.

AD

AD

The first argument came from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.) on “Fox News Sunday.” Chris Wallace pushed Collins on whether he saw it as a problem that Trump conditioned official acts — whether a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid — on announcing investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden:

.@RepDougCollins's explanation for why he doesn't think Trump did anything wrong w/ Ukraine is one of the most epic word salads ever served: ""There was nothing about a problematic giving aid to another country in which you're talking about corruption, which you're required to do"" pic.twitter.com/UvMGpOEFEk — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 1, 2019

Collins claimed there was “nothing problematic” about conditioning aid on Ukraine rooting out “corruption.” He then said in the very next breath that it “just so happened” that the corruption in question involved Hunter Biden, insisting that “other witnesses” also said Hunter’s arrangement with the Ukrainian company Burisma was questionable.

As Will Saletan notes, no witness said this. But the crucial point here is that Collins has adopted the position that there was nothing wrong with demanding this investigation, because it was just pure coincidence that the corruption in question (which is entirely fabricated) involved a chief 2020 rival.

AD

AD

The idea that Trump was focused on generic corruption is falsifiable: Trump aides and allies have privately and publicly conceded it’s bunk, and on his call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump explicitly called only for investigations that would help him politically. Whatever Collins actually believes about Trump’s motives, what’s staring us in the face is that Collins is arguing that what Trump actually did do is just fine.

Senator Kennedy’s laughable spin

We also saw this from Sen. John Kennedy (La.), who said on NBC News: “I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.” Kennedy continued that Trump should be allowed to present evidence to this effect, in keeping with his “demonstrated record fighting foreign corruption.”

AD

The notion that Ukraine interfered in 2016 is based on a series of occurrences (which Kennedy alluded to) that have been wildly distorted beyond any connection with reality. As Glenn Kessler details, it’s based on “flotsam and jetsam” that has nothing whatsoever in common with the state-level interference alleged.

AD

But the point here is that Kennedy is saying not just that this interference happened but also that it justified Trump’s demand for investigations to get to the bottom of it as part of his efforts to fight “foreign corruption.”

Senate Republicans will advance this argument at Trump’s impeachment trial: Trump understandably concluded he’d been victimized by a Ukrainian plot; therefore, Trump’s demand for Zelensky to “investigate” it was entirely justified.

AD

But they will be doing this after intelligence officials privately warned them this theory has been Russian propaganda for years. That’s because it’s supposed to help absolve Russia of sabotaging the 2016 election for Trump (which will also absolve his campaign of efforts to coordinate with and benefit from it).

Indeed, this is what gives the theory its political utility for Trump. Here again, the argument requires you to believe this demand for an investigation into “corruption” would also help him politically by pure coincidence.

AD

But putting aside how laughable that is, we’re once again left with this: Republicans are arguing that Trump’s pressure on Zelensky was absolutely fine.

AD

The actual GOP position

On both these fronts, Republicans are entirely unperturbed by Trump’s use of his office to solicit foreign interference in the next election on his behalf. They absurdly claim influencing the election wasn’t the motive, but that actually underscores the point: They have largely adopted the posture that making these demands of Zelensky was justified — that it was the correct thing to do.

In an alternate universe in which reporters and commentators fully reckoned with this state of affairs, any process objections would be immediately dismissed as pure bad faith and misdirection rather than being treated as one of two competing but equivalently legitimate and sincerely felt arguments in a conventional political skirmish.

AD

AD

One can envision some Republicans sincerely believing Trump’s conduct was justifiable while also harboring sincere process objections. But accepting this requires extensive denial about the spectacular bad faith we’ve already seen, from the up-is-down inversion of witness claims into their diametric opposites, to the reflexive reversion to conspiracy theories hermetically sealed off from factual penetration entirely.

Indeed, as Jay Rosen notes, the familiar lament that the two sides can’t agree on common facts is itself distortive. It obscures the degree to which Republicans are employing their various claims — about process and substance alike — in purely instrumental ways.

The New York Times gets at this bluntly:

AD

Republicans … want to mire Democrats in a sloppy fight, making the hearings into such a confusing mishmash of competing information that even Republicans troubled by Mr. Trump’s actions see no upside in breaking with him.

Republicans have made up their minds: Trump did no wrong. The process objections lay the groundwork to create the impression that if few or no Republican minds end up getting changed, it’s because the case against Trump was mishandled and not because changing Republican minds was never possible.

His last comment, offered after the last two witnesses testified, was similarly dismissive of Trump’s guilt.

“What you’re seeing in this room over the past two weeks is a show trial,” said Nunes (R-Calif.), “the planned result of three years of political operations and dirty tricks, campaigns waged against this president. And like any good show trial, the verdict was decided before the trial ever began.”

On Monday, The Washington Post obtained a 123-page document drafted by Nunes and other senior House Republicans that offers a rebuttal to the expected report from the Democratic majority. The thrust of the document is that Trump’s interactions with Ukraine were aboveboard and understandable, an outgrowth of his demonstrated commitments and concerns that suggested no ulterior motives — and, indeed, that no such motives were shown. It is, in essence, a formalized, more tonally neutral version of the argument that Nunes offered repeatedly from the dais — and one that is often at odds with the testimony that Nunes and his colleagues heard.

The document delineates 10 findings to exonerate Trump. They are listed in bold below, followed by our analysis of how robust an argument can be made for them.

“President Trump has a deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption.”

AD

AD

On May 23, a small group of officials met with Trump at the White House after having attended Zelensky’s inauguration several days prior. The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, testified that the group hoped to convey to Trump its confidence that Zelensky would tackle endemic corruption in the country.

“Unfortunately,” Sondland told the committee, “President Trump was skeptical. He expressed concerns that the Ukrainian government was not serious about reform, and he even mentioned that Ukraine tried to take him down in the last election.”

By this point, Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani had already publicly and repeatedly criticized alleged Ukrainian corruption, focused on two issues that quickly became central to Trump’s own beliefs. The first was the “tried to take him down” claim, a vague reference to the unfounded idea that Ukraine had tried to interfere in the 2016 election against Trump. The other was Giuliani’s belief that former vice president Joe Biden had demanded the firing of a prosecutor investigating a company, Burisma Holdings, for which Biden’s son Hunter worked. The primary source for Giuliani’s belief? The fired prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was targeted by Biden and others within the Obama administration and internationally for failing to act on corruption.

As we’ve reported, if Trump had a “deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism” of corruption in Ukraine, he never mentioned it before the emergence of his interactions with Zelensky in September. He talked about corruption all the time — in the context of Democrats and the media. Trump has never indicated a real interest in combating international corruption as president.

We have documentation of three times when Trump and Zelensky spoke directly: The April 21 call after Zelensky won the election, the July 25 call mentioned above and a Sept. 25 public press availability with the two presidents in New York.

AD

In none of those conversations did Trump address corruption in any context except wanting an investigation of the Bidens specifically.

AD

“President Trump has a long-held skepticism of U.S. foreign assistance and believes that Europe should pay its fair share for mutual defense.”

It is true that Trump has frequently complained about foreign aid and that he has at times ordered that aid be reduced or halted. It’s similarly true that he has advocated that Europe contribute more to NATO, though that’s generally an apparent misunderstanding of the benchmark requirement of NATO members, which focuses on defense spending as a function of GDP and not actual contributions to the organization.

AD

What’s important to remember in this case, though, is that there was no explanation communicated within the administration for the stoppage of aid to Ukraine. Trump was apparently alerted to the aid after the Defense Department publicly announced military assistance in late June (according to Mark Sandy of the Office of Management and Budget). By July 3, multiple administration officials were aware that a hold had been placed on the aid, a halt communicated more broadly on July 18. Ukraine was aware of the halt as early as July 25 — the day of the Trump-Zelensky call.

AD

More importantly: If the aid was halted by Trump simply because he didn’t like foreign aid, that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t then used to pressure Ukraine.

“President Trump’s concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board are valid. The Obama State Department noted concerns about Hunter Biden’s relationship with Burisma in 2015 and 2016.”

AD

There is little dispute that Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board as his father served as vice president was potentially problematic.

However, this isn’t what Trump expressed. In the July 25 call, he described his desire for an investigation as follows:

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

This is not a “concern about Hunter Biden’s role.” This is Trump lifting up the allegation made by Shokin (and rebutted by numerous other officials) that he was fired because Joe Biden acted inappropriately. There is no question raised by Trump about Hunter Biden and no investigation of Hunter Biden requested. The focus is only on Joe Biden, a potential 2020 opponent of Trump’s.

AD

“There is indisputable evidence that senior Ukrainian government officials opposed President Trump’s candidacy in the 2016 election and did so publicly. It has been publicly reported that a Democratic National Committee operative worked with Ukrainian officials, including the Ukrainian Embassy, to dig up dirt on then-candidate Trump.”

AD

These claims are extraneous to the issue at hand, which focuses on Trump’s own actions. They are, instead, an attempt to rationalize what Trump did, just as the above claims about Hunter Biden are meant to offer an argument for why Trump might have wanted an investigation of the former vice president’s son.

In this case, though, the evidence for the claims themselves is even less defensible. We reported on this at length on Monday, articulating the claims above and assessing the evidence behind them. In short, two or three senior officials disparaged Trump on social media, something that former Trump National Security Council official Fiona Hill testified was common among officials of numerous countries, including close U.S. allies. The “operative” who worked to “dig up dirt” was, in fact, a DNC consultant in charge of outreach who investigated the Trump campaign chairman’s political work in Ukraine on the side. It was reportedly an effort to see whether Paul Manafort’s hands were dirty, not Trump’s — and Manafort’s hands turned out to be demonstrably dirty, leading to his resignation from the campaign.

AD

Comparing this to Russia’s 2016 interference is ridiculous. Politico reported Monday afternoon that Senate Republicans who looked at the question agreed.

AD

“The evidence does not establish that President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election for the purpose of benefiting him in the 2020 election.”

The evidence — the rough transcript of the July 25 call — clearly demonstrates that Trump pressured Ukraine to launch two investigations, one about Joe Biden’s targeting of Shokin and one focused on a false theory that Ukraine was somehow involved in inaccurately blaming Russia for culpability in hacking the DNC in 2016. Others in the administration went further, pushing for a broader 2016 probe or of Burisma itself.

AD

The question of pressure itself is well established. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a member of the NSC, noted the inherent imbalance between the United States and Ukraine that underlines any request from the American president. David Holmes, a staffer at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, outlined how Ukraine felt — and still feels — pressure to comply with Trump’s requests.

Were the requests meant to benefit Trump in the 2020 election? That is harder to evaluate, in part because it depends on understanding his motivation.

We can focus on the specific requests being made: to probe Joe Biden in particular and to cast doubt on a central component of Russia’s 2016 interference (the DNC hacking). Were Ukraine to announce investigations that might have those results, the political benefit to Trump would be tangible, but the effects on Trump’s purported actual concerns — corruption and 2016 interference by Ukraine — negligible. Republicans have inserted Trump’s specific requests into a broader, more nebulous context precisely so that they can dismiss criticism of the requests as having been politically motivated. Here, they’re saying that the contexts are apolitical, though, of course, the actual requests weren’t.

“The evidence does not establish that President Trump withheld a meeting with President Zelensky for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election.”

The evidence shows quite clearly that Sondland demanded investigations from Ukraine before approving a Trump-Zelensky meeting in Washington; he said as much. He also testified that he did so in compliance with Giuliani’s wishes — after being told by Trump that he and his colleagues should work with Giuliani on Ukraine in that May 23 meeting.

More specifically, there’s ample documentary evidence and testimony to suggest that Trump specifically requested that Ukraine agree to investigations before a meeting would move forward, including a chain of communications from the White House to an adviser to a senior Zelensky aide right before the July 25 call in which the aide was instructed that a meeting depended on new investigations. On the call, Trump didn’t invite Zelensky to the White House until after the investigations were agreed to.

In short, there’s little doubt that this was precisely the quid pro quo at stake.

“The evidence does not support that President Trump withheld U.S. security assistance to Ukraine for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election.”

Note the phrasing here: a lack of evidence that Trump withheld aid for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine. As established above, that may be the case — but it also doesn’t preclude Trump from having understood that the stoppage in aid put pressure on Ukraine to comply with his wishes. There was no rationale given for stopping the aid, leading Sondland to assume that the halt was linked to the desire for the investigations (since the White House meeting was explicitly predicated on the same thing). In his testimony, Holmes argued that Ukraine would have come to the same conclusion.

The aid was released only after questions had already emerged about whether it was stopped to pressure Ukraine to launch new probes that were politically useful to Trump. It was released only after congressional Democrats announced an investigation of Giuliani’s efforts and why the aid was stopped in the first place.

When Sondland told Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) that the aid was halted to force the investigations, Johnson raised the question with Trump. Trump insisted that there was no link — but that he needed to know what had happened in 2016.

“The evidence does not support that President Trump orchestrated a shadow foreign policy apparatus for the purpose of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election.”

During her testimony, Hill described Sondland’s efforts and how they contrasted with the formal diplomatic process.

“I was upset with him that he wasn’t fully telling us about all of the meetings that he was having,” she testified. “And he said to me: ‘But I’m briefing the president, I’m briefing Chief of Staff [Mick] Mulvaney, I’m briefing Secretary [Mike] Pompeo, and I’ve talked to Ambassador [John] Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with?’ ”

“And the point is, we have a robust interagency process that deals with Ukraine,” she continued. “It includes Mr. Holmes. It includes Ambassador [Bill] Taylor as the chargé in Ukraine. It includes a whole load of other people. But it struck me when yesterday, when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland’s emails, and who was on these emails, and he said … ‘these people need to know,’ that he was absolutely right.”

“Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were being involved in national security foreign policy,” she said. “And those two things had just diverged. So he was correct.”

Put simply, Hill and others in the formal diplomatic channel saw Sondland’s efforts as distinct from that effort. Sondland saw his job as effecting Ukraine policy in accordance with Giuliani’s focus, at Trump’s request — and that included explicitly leveraging a White House meeting for the desired investigations.

That’s not reconcilable with the presentation made in the Republican “finding.”

“The evidence does not support that President Trump covered up the substance of his telephone conversation with President Zelensky by restricting access to the call summary.”

One of the allegations made in the original whistleblower complaint was that the White House tried to prevent people from learning about Trump’s call with Zelensky by moving the rough transcript to a more secure storage system.

While multiple witnesses indicated that they didn’t see that move as necessarily nefarious (including Vindman), the rationale for moving it was, according to former NSC staffer Tim Morrison, to prevent it from leaking.

The Republicans are unequivocally correct on one point: The order to move it didn’t come from Trump but from an NSC attorney.

“President Trump’s assertion of longstanding claims of executive privilege is a legitimate response to an unfair, abusive, and partisan process, and does not constitute obstruction of a legitimate impeachment inquiry.”"
109,Philip Bump,"In 2016, when Biden was flirting with a presidential run, we walked through the words etymology, coming to the unsatisfying determination that it sort of just came into use from undetermined origins.

It’s possibly related to an Irish last name or perhaps it was ginned up by a cartoonist in San Francisco. Regardless, almost no one in American history has been as deliberate in embracing the term as Biden, whose tour of Iowa this week is taking place in a bus emblazoned with a large “No Malarkey!” slogan.

The heyday of “malarkey” on the pages of The Post came in the 1980s. There were a few little bursts before, including in the late 1800s, when Washington Senators pitcher John Malarkey was racking up a grim 2-10 record over three seasons. In the 1940s, Western High School slugger Jack Malarkey got fairly regular write-ups in the paper. By the 1980s, though, the word’s appearances were mostly of the sort that Biden would appreciate. By the 2000s, the popularity of the word had died again.

Google’s extensive index of books allows us to see how the popularity of words evolves over time. Its Ngram tool shows the frequency of words as a percentage of all words from books published in a particular year.

That data shows that use of “malarkey” spiked in books in the 1980s, just as it did in The Post. Interestingly, “malarkey” seems to have edged out “malarky,” with the latter spelling dying out from the 1960s on, as use of the former continued to gain steam. There’s a slight drop-off beginning about 2004; the Google Books data only goes through 2008.

Biden uses the more popular -ey spelling, perhaps a reflection of his embrace of it during its 1980s renaissance. There’s this sense from Biden critics that he’s embracing a wildly archaic phrase like “the bee’s knees.” Instead, it seems he’s harking back to a term that was resurgent when he was in his late 30s and early 40s — and when his political power and professional stature were expanding. It’s perhaps less like Biden talking about wearing an onion on his belt than his being able to sing along with “Livin’ on a Prayer.”

AD

AD

Cultural phenomenons recur in a cyclical fashion, though the duration of those cycles isn’t constant. It seems feasible that the 1980s brought nostalgia for a term that had emerged 30-plus years earlier — and that Biden is single-handedly powering a renaissance another 30-plus years on. “Malarkey” may be doing for Biden what “Make America Great Again” did for Trump on a smaller scale in evoking the era of President Ronald Reagan.

Most of his embrace of the term is about branding, reinforcing his political identity, and the traits we identified at the beginning of the article. He’s the guy who called Republican ideas “malarkey” and he’s the guy who uses terms like “malarkey” because he’s old and centered and willing to use normal-guy terms like “malarkey” even if that is abnormal.

There’s a corniness to it that is on-brand for Biden. It’s the sort of thing that seems like it could appeal to older voters (and older white voters) more than anyone else. That’s a group that makes up a large chunk of the population, if only a smaller part of the Democratic primary electorate. (Biden’s distinctive strength in the primary is among black Democratic voters.)

Some of the earliest uses of “malarkey” in the New York Times were references to Irish Americans who bore that last name. One article from Nov. 28, 1878, notes that an Officer Malarkey arrested a guy named Martin Smith for, of all things, voting illegally. Smith was a felon who thought his release from prison enabled him to vote again. It did not.

It is unclear whether this Officer Malarkey is the same one who the Times reported several years later had been bitten on the ear by a suspect.

They’ve heard the over-the-top pandering before and gritted their teeth as politicians who had never shown up presume to tell them what is wrong in their communities. Biden does not have to stress and strain, nor present glitzy proposals to convince them of his sincerity; his heart is in the right place, and that is enough for many older African American votes.

For Biden, the overwhelming support of these voters is his best and only shot at the nomination. The New York Times reports that “an overwhelming majority of delegates are awarded from areas more racially diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests.” If you look simply at the delegate count, “While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates.” Victories in later states with more delegates and more African American voters are Biden’s best hope of winning what may be a long, closely contested race.

AD

AD

Biden’s biggest fear is that poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire will unravel his campaign, causing African American and other voters to look for a winning candidate. Biden is fortunate in that there is no single, obvious candidate to which African American voters are likely to migrate.

It is not for lack of trying. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is pulling out all the stops, first with a TV ad focused on South Carolina, smartly referencing his faith:

He was also in South Carolina seeking to prove his sincerity with African American voters. The Post reports on his visit to the Greenleaf Christian Church, pastored by the Rev. William J. Barber II:

AD

Buttigieg’s decision to worship with the Disciples of Christ congregation underscored the task that awaits him as he seeks to convince voters that he can credibly lead a diverse coalition to capture the White House. “I believe that I am here to make myself useful — that I am part of this political process to make myself useful, but also that I was put on this Earth in order to make myself useful to others,” Buttigieg told more than 100 members of the mixed-race congregation who stayed following the Sunday service to witness the candidate field questions for two hours from Barber, along with other faith leaders, activists and voters. “These are the values that I was taught by my parents. These are the values that I’m taught by my faith.”

Buttigieg is trying hard to make up for lacking the kind of decades-old relationship with the African American community that Biden enjoys. “Buttigieg also sat for a lesson of sorts, as Barber displayed slides showing maps aimed to illustrate the overlapping effects of voter suppression, poverty and other scourges. . . . Barber is pressing for a presidential debate on poverty and racism.” Unsurprisingly, “Buttigieg called that debate ‘imperative’ as he issued a ‘moral call to unity’ designed to ‘confront all of the interwoven and interlocking sources of systematic poverty and systematic racism.’”

AD

One almost feels sorry for Buttigieg as he racks his brain trying to show his good intentions as Biden stumbles through debate after debate — his African American supporters shrugging off every misstep, even ones that smack of racial paternalism.

No one knows how enduring Biden’s support will be nor how impactful Buttigieg wins in early states might be. However, Biden might be smart to look for some insurance in Nevada. That’s not a lily-white state, although not as heavily African American as South Carolina, which comes a week later.

AD

In 2016 African American and Hispanic voters made up a third of the Democratic electorate. Hillary Clinton’s modest victory against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who won the Hispanic vote, was due largely to her overwhelming victory with African American votes. If Biden wants a firewall after Iowa and New Hampshire, a quick way to dislodge candidates whose support is less diverse, he would be wise to spend plenty of time in Nevada. It’s not clear if “as goes Nevada, so goes South Carolina,” but a win there would sure help fend off competition from Buttigieg and other candidates who ran strongly in Iowa and New Hampshire.

News accounts documented tensions and confusing lines of authority in the campaign, which, when things are going poorly, often become the default explanations. (Those accounts, in turn, make fundraising difficult if not impossible.) However, these “dissension in the ranks” stories tend to be more a symptom than the cause of a campaign’s unwinding. In this case, it was a campaign for a candidate boxed in between far-left progressives and moderates, with no single policy objective to provide an organizing principle. She did suffer at times from a lack of focus, a fuzziness that some incorrectly attributed to excessive caution.

Looking for a single reason one candidate fails in a field of two dozen, the majority of the early dropouts being white men, is a favorite exercise of pundits, but an unsatisfying exercise. She failed to define her position on health care soon enough. She went back to the well attacking Biden one too many times in the second debate. She counted on Biden losing African American support early. There is a measure of truth to each rationale, but let me identify two overarching challenges that brought her down.

First, in large part due to media narratives, electability in this race centered around the mythical white working class male who voted for Donald Trump and feared immigrants but nevertheless might vote Democrat in 2020. The electable candidates were thus defined as white males, or at least white. The safe pick became synonymous with Biden, and the risky picks became progressives and/or people of color. An entirely different view of electability based on the success of women and minority candidates winning in 2018 could easily have been the story, but it was not. Harris thereafter became a higher-risk candidate, maybe the highest risk of all. In this, many in the pundit class bear a great deal of the blame for erecting a barrier for nonwhite and female candidates. Ultimately, it is up to a campaign to make its electability argument successful, but in Harris’s case she simply had a much higher hill to climb.

AD

AD

Harris’s second obstacle was that she has never run for office outside California. There, she is a mainstream Democrat, a strong crusader for gay rights and defender of immigrants, legal and otherwise. She is comfortable in her milieu and excels at the intra-Democratic politics in a state that essentially has only one major party.

California, of course, is not the totality of America. Especially in the early primary states, successful Democratic candidates must show they are as comfortable in and with the heartland, as accessible to small-town Iowans as to San Franciscans. The media does not get why Biden holds onto his voters or why a “no malarkey” tour may work in Iowa; they too often bring the coastal elite mind-set to a race that in the early going is decided by people who do not naturally embrace urban progressives. Harris never quite made the leap from San Francisco to Des Moines.

Harris, like most every first-time candidate, failed in her first presidential run. She is in good company. But her ability to relate to and excite nonwhites and women, her ability to reach voters former President Barack Obama carried but didn’t come out for Hillary Clinton, and her ability to deliver withering barbs at President Trump should put her on every candidate’s shortlist for vice president (whether she wants the spot on the ticket or not). A Biden-Harris ticket, with a one-term Biden presidency? A Buttigieg-Harris ticket? These seem hardly far-fetched.

And suddenly it seems that there’s a multitude of voices, Democrat and Republican, assailing Medicare-for-all.

AD

AD

I’m sure many of those critics are perfectly sincere. But as The Post’s Jeff Stein reports, there’s more going on behind the scenes:

Lobbyists either helped draft or made extensive revisions to opinion columns published by three state lawmakers in a way that warned against the dangers of Medicare-for-all and other government involvement in health care, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client. Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms.

This is hardly the first time a lobbyist or representative of an interest group wrote an op-ed for a legislator, but it’s an important reminder of what’s happening with the health-care debate. On one side, you’ve got some pro-Medicare-for-all groups such as Physicians for a National Health Program, with modest budgets and small staffs. (PNHP has a staff of four.) In the middle, you have Democratic presidential candidates arguing about how far to go on health-care reform. And on the other side, you have insurers, hospitals, drug companies, device companies and other health-care interests who together wouldn’t think twice about dropping hundreds of millions of dollars to destroy Medicare-for-all and anything that resembles it.

After all, there are tens of billions of dollars in profits at stake. Which is why those groups formed the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, which will be the vanguard of the war on health-care reform should a Democrat be elected president and try to get an ambitious bill passed.

AD

AD

Here’s one of the most important things to understand about these interests: They despise “moderate” reform as much as they do Medicare-for-all. There are reasons the kind of expansive public-option plan being offered by Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg is more politically practical than single-payer, but opposition from industry is not one of them. Just look, for instance, at this ad from the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, in which actors doing their best worried faces say, “Politicians may call it Medicare-for-all, Medicare buy-in or the public option, but they mean the same thing: higher taxes or higher premiums, lower quality care, politicians and bureaucrats in control of our care.”

Although a single-payer system obviously presents the greatest threat to their profits, their belief is that any reform that allows large numbers of people to move on to government programs makes genuine cost control more likely, and that’s what they want to avoid.

In what may be the most revealing moment in the article showing consultants associated with the Partnership crafting op-eds for state legislators, the consultant “removed three paragraphs from a draft of Kelker’s op-ed that pointed out that the United States 'clearly spends significantly more on health care per capita than other developed nations.’” This is one of the most important facts about our health-care problem, but it’s the last thing the Partnership and its backers want anyone thinking about. Why? Because if you start cutting costs, they make less money.

AD

AD

The current proposals for a public option envision huge numbers of Americans — tens or even hundreds of millions — moving over to public plans, depriving insurers of customers and facilitating future cost-cutting. So the health-care industry’s strategy is to fill Americans with terror, convincing them that any major reform will cost them more, give them poorer care and make them more insecure. Even if the opposite is almost certainly true on all counts.

This raises an important point all the Democratic presidential candidates should be forced to address. Any of them, if elected, would face a furious industry campaign to destroy their proposed health-care reform. All the candidates should explain how they plan to overcome it. As of yet, none of them have had much to say on the subject.

But while most of those who’ve dropped out over the course of the year were white men (including two already this week), Harris was both the best-polling nonwhite candidate and, for a brief moment this summer, someone who looked as if she might ascend to the top tier of the crowded field. That surge, following the first debate, soon faded, and Harris never regained her momentum.

There have been 27 major or major-adjacent candidates who’ve declared at some point. Fifteen of them remain, including the recent additions of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.

The debate criteria introduced by the Democratic Party have been effective at winnowing the field. While many of those still in the race haven’t been making the cut for recent debates, many of those who dropped out did so after failing to earn a debate slot.

But compare where we are now with what the field looked like on Valentine’s Day. At that point, most of those who had declared were women, black or Hispanic. Most of them are still in the race, even with Harris’s departure.

Now compare that with what the field looks like after Harris left.

Pay particular attention to that December debate column. It shows the six candidates who’ve earned a slot, all of whom are white. Harris had earned a slot but obviously won’t be participating following her departure from the race.

AD

AD

Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. Its strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.

It’s important to recognize, though, that this assessment of the collapse of diversity in the field overlooks two important factors.

The first is that we’re really only talking about racial and ethnic diversity. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will appear in December, as will candidates who would become the first Jewish (Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders) or openly gay (South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg) presidents in U.S. history.

AD

AD

The second is that one reason that the field is narrowing to mostly white candidates is Democratic voters overwhelmingly support white candidates. The Post’s most recent primary poll, conducted with ABC News, showed that white candidates earned more than 80 percent of all support from Democratic primary voters, driven by the two-thirds eaten up by former vice president Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders. White men got just under 60 percent of all support.

Among nonwhite voters, white men got more support than among Democratic voters overall, albeit so slightly that the difference isn’t statistically significant. Even that is noteworthy, though: White and nonwhite voters support white and nonwhite candidates about equally.

At least when considered in demographic groups. Biden fares much better with black primary voters than do other candidates, one central reason he continues to lead the field.

As CNN’s Ronald Brownstein has noted, no candidate has been able to cobble together a coalition like the one enjoyed by Barack Obama in 2008. Biden’s doing well with black voters, Warren and Buttigieg are jostling for college-educated whites, and Sanders is performing well with younger voters. A broad split — but, again, all white.

As is often the case in American politics in 2019, President Trump plays a role here. Defeating Trump continues to be a primary motivation for Democratic primary voters, and white Democratic candidates continue to be seen — however justifiably — as the candidates with the best chance of winning in 2020. In our November poll, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the candidates most capable of beating Trump.

Perceptions of electability can change quickly. It did for Harris after her first debate performance, and it has for other candidates in the past. So far this year, though, Biden’s edge on electability has been consistent, even as electability has become a central concern of voters. That has been an ongoing problem for his opponents.

The other problem, of course, is that you have to be a candidate to benefit from a sudden surge in views of your electability. With a field winnowing down to largely white candidates, the odds that the Democratic nominee isn’t white necessarily drop significantly.

The Republicans’ 123-page report asserts that Trump “has a deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption” and aversion to foreign aid, and that public criticism by Ukrainian officials justified his suspicion. The defense is ludicrous for a batch of reasons.

First, for a guy so concerned about corruption, he never mentioned it. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe observes, “Trump never raised a concern with corruption as such on any call with [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky or anyone else.” The Obama administration was interested in fighting corruption and deployed Biden to, for example, pressure Ukraine to oust a corrupt prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Trump thought this was awful and wanted to investigate Biden for doing this.

Second, what Trump did raise in his call with Zelensky was the “Bidens” and the ludicrous CrowdStrike conspiracy. “The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.” Trump infamously told Zelensky, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it.” None of this has to do with rooting out corruption.

AD

AD

Third, if Trump was so concerned about corruption, why release aid in September when the plot was uncovered? One would think his deep-seated concern about Ukrainian corruption would not have been alleviated with no additional intervening action on anti-corruption measures.

Fourth, if anti-corruption was his obsession, why did Trump want a public announcement specifically mentioning the Bidens? Trump wanted the PR value of headlines blaring “Ukraine investigating Biden,” but he showed no interest in doing any actual investigation. He never, for example, tasked the attorney general with investigating the matter.

Fifth, as attorney Maya Wiley noted, Trump never bothered to correct or contradict Giuliani in May when he publicly promised to goad Ukraine into conducting probes “very, very helpful” to Trump.

AD

AD

Sixth, if Trump was conducting a serious investigation of corruption, why deny there was a “quid pro quo” — that is, investigations in exchange for release of aid. Instead, he should have declared, “Darn right I’m not giving those people a penny!”

Seventh, the role of Giuliani makes no sense if this was about fighting corruption. He had a skilled anti-corruption fighter in Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump fired at the behest of Giuliani and his cronies. Former prosecutor Harry Litman tweeted that there was “no possible reason to have Rudy running the show of course, much less fire Yovanovitch. The normal career and political officials can and do fight corruption just fine--that’s their main lookout in fact and they all made clear Trump subverted it.”

Eighth, as my colleague Aaron Blake points out, the excuse that Trump was seeking a “thoughtful review” of corruption before meeting with Zelensky is inane. “There already was a ‘thoughtful review’ of Ukraine’s anti-corruption measures, and Ukraine passed it. It came from the Defense Department, which concluded in May that Ukraine had made sufficient progress on corruption to merit the aid.”

AD

AD

Ninth, for a guy so interested in fighting corruption, he’s made a practice of cavorting with some of the most corrupt authoritarians on the planet — Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Tribe puts it, Trump, “to tell the truth, has never evidenced any such concern in his entire life — whether with Ukraine or with any other government — apart from his manifestly phony comments about ‘draining the swamp’ that he has done more than anybody else to fill.”

Tenth, if the explanation for all of this is entirely innocent, why would former national security adviser John Bolton have characterized the Giuliani-Mick Mulvaney activities as a “drug deal” and told his subordinates to inform the lawyers, and why would the lawyers not have explained to those raising concerns — such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman — that the holdup was entirely appropriate (rather than instructing him to tell no one about it)?

Eleventh, there is no reason to withhold documents or to prevent witnesses such as acting chief of staff Mulvaney or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from testifying if the explanation, supported by documents, shows Trump’s determination to fight corruption. Surely there would be documented evidence of Trump’s “genuine” concern for stopping corruption, right?

AD

AD

Twelfth, Trump should be dying to participate in the impeachment hearings if he had a valid reason for strong-arming Ukraine. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) commented, “If the President thinks the call was ‘perfect’ and there is nothing to hide … [he would] provide any exculpatory information that refutes the overwhelming evidence of his abuse of power.” Instead, Trump is bent on undermining the process and encourages his helpmates in the House to raise one bogus conspiracy theory after another.

C’mon, who are Republicans kidding? Saying Trump is concerned about corruption is about as believable as saying he is concerned about his own conflicts of interest or nepotism. If this is the best Republicans can come up with, there really is no factual or constitutional defense for Trump.

President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign. The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.

Those facts have yet to be contradicted. We have Trump’s own words on the July 25 rough transcript (“do us a favor though”), diplomat David Holmes’s account of the president pressing Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about “investigations,"" the hold on nearly $400 million in aid, Trump’s public statements inviting China and Ukraine to weigh into the election and the testimony of multiple career civil services that Trump outsourced his scheme primarily to Rudolph W. Giuliani, who publicly bragged that he was talking about Biden with Ukrainians.

AD

AD

What is new are the call records showing ongoing communications between Giuliani and the Office of Management and Budget (which ordered the hold on aid) and, stunningly, between the ranking Republican member of the Intelligence Committee (and conspiracy monger) Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.) and indicted Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. Nunes therefore becomes a fact witness, and his efforts to disrupt the hearings and toss out one red herring after another begin to reek of self-interested obstruction of the committees work.

Constitutional scholar Laurence H. Tribe comments, “The evidence of those suspicious Giuliani phone calls with [Vladimir] Putin-linked thugs reinforces the overwhelming case that the American president was directing a criminal conspiracy to conscript US military aid and the august powers of his office to benefit himself and his own reelection at the expense of the national security.” He adds, “If this isn’t impeachable and removable conduct, we’re done as a constitutional republic.”

The report also makes clear that Trump’s scheme “was undertaken with the knowledge and approval of senior Administration officials, including the President’s Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.” The report reminds us, “In fact, at a press conference weeks after public revelations about the scheme, Mr. Mulvaney publicly acknowledged that the President directly tied the hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation, telling Americans to ‘get over it.’”

AD

AD

Aside from the near-airtight factual case against Trump for having engaged in what amounts to bribery and extortion for political gain, the report makes crystal clear the necessity of obtaining testimony from other witnesses. “The call records the committee obtained make clear there is a treasure trove of evidence lying just beyond their grasp,” says former Justice Department spokesman Matt Miller. “Had the White House not obstructed this investigation, they could have obtained testimony about what these people discussed and almost certainly produced even more damning evidence than they already have.” Miller adds, “It also seems to show that Nunes was in the middle of this plot from the beginning, which might explain why he was so mad throughout the hearings.”

For starters, Nunes needs to appear and provide testimony under oath. None of his calls or actions implicate any privilege; he is not immune from subpoenas as a fact witness. Moreover, given the direct communication with the OMB, its senior political appointees must appear and answer questions about their contacts with Giuliani.

Moreover, in view of the conclusion that senior officials knew of the scheme, their testimony becomes all the more vital. As luck would have it, a federal district court just denied a stay on the order former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit just affirmed a lower-court ruling that Deutsche Bank and Capital One must turn over financial records to the House. Both obliterate Trump’s claims of “absolute immunity."" The report underscores that it is worth a brief pause to pursue witnesses hiding behind bogus immunity claims. The courts now seem to be moving with speed, providing some chance that vital witnesses could be corralled.

AD

“There’s a real difference in hearing the story witness by witness and seeing it all laid out on a timeline,” observes former prosecutor Joyce White Vance. “It’s like watching the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. As Schiff says, the country now has to decide whether what happened is impeachable or whether the country has to ‘get over it’ as Trump’s chief of staff said, and let presidents use the power of their office to cheat in elections.”

The Intelligence Committee’s report is a triumph of clarity and thoroughness. Now to make the best possible case, the House should press to hear from newly revealed witnesses who have knowledge of Trump’s action and potentially participated in wrongdoing. If current Cabinet members such as Pompeo do not appear, the House should consider impeaching them as well. The stonewalling must end.

Despite having viral, breakout moments during the Senate’s investigation of Russia’s interference into the 2016 presidential election, Harris remained largely unknown to many Americans before launching her campaign — even among the groups many people thought would propel her. Her campaign was a reminder that being well known in Washington and political circles is not the same thing as having national recognition. While some more established liberal candidates were working to convince voters that they were best positioned to undo President Trump’s political decisions, Harris was in many ways still introducing herself. And that put the junior senator at a bit of a disadvantage — even with black women, one of the Democratic Party’s most influential voting blocs.

Some of Trump’s strongest criticism comes from black women — a group that votes against the GOP at higher rates than most. But while many black women long for representation at the highest level of government, some voters questioned whether a black woman could attract the broad support needed to defeat Trump. This concern, along with former vice president Joe Biden’s long history with black voters, is part of what sent Biden flying past Harris in polls with black voters shortly after launching his campaign.

Danielle Moodie-Mills, host of the radio show “WokeAF,” said last week that Biden, who enjoys widespread name recognition, is a safe bet with many black voters.

“You have older black voters who are definitely on his side because they are looking to see where are the white voters who voted for Donald Trump going to go,” she said on MSNBC. “We understand what oppression and discrimination looks like on a regular basis, and we understand Donald Trump to be a lethal threat to our way of life. And so we are going to go … the way that seems the safest.”

There were also questions about Harris among some of those groups she sought to win. Her history as a prosecutor — and her role in advocating for tough sentences for people of color — forced her to answer questions that voters looking for a candidate committed to criminal justice reform repeatedly asked. And some black Americans questioned whether the daughter of a Jamaican immigrant raised by an Indian woman could respond to the issues affecting black Americans calling on the United States to reexamine the ongoing impact of slavery on racial gaps.

In her announcement ending her campaign, Harris pointed toward fundraising being the biggest obstacle that kept her from moving forward.

“My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,” she wrote. “… And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.”

Harris noted that she was not able to self-fund her campaign like some of the billionaire candidates, but she does have more money than some of her competitors — in fact, enough to qualify for the December debate, something not all of her competitors have done.

With Harris’s exit, the stage for December’s Democratic debate primarily consists of white candidates and older candidates during a time when the left’s constituency is younger and more ethnically diverse. Despite this shift, long-standing perceptions of leadership remain among some voters.

Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, a political action committee that helps black women get elected to office, previously told The Fix that black women seeking office often have a harder time than white men in getting people to get behind their campaign.

“I think a lot of it has to do with our perception of what leadership looks like. For umpteen years, the majority of elected leaders have been white and male,” she said. “You come and counter that with a woman — and a woman of color, and a black woman at that — seeking the highest office in the land, it’s something out of the norm.”

Regular frustrations with conversations about electability led Harris’s defenders to argue that she was the candidate most prepared to defeat Trump. But for those who were hoping Harris would break the glass ceiling that 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton could not, 2020 was simply not Harris’s time. And as cliched as it sounds, in politics, timing is often everything.

AD

Here are five takeaways from the report.

1. Democrats lay out why Trump should be impeached.

“The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election,” the executive summary of their report reads.

AD

How Democrats pieced together that allegation gives us clues as to what they think some of the articles of impeachment should be. Like:

Abuse of power: This is described throughout the report, such as here:

President Trump used the power of the Office of the President and exercised his authority over the executive branch, including his control of the instruments of the federal government, to apply increasing pressure on the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically-motivated investigations desired by President Trump.

And later, they write that asking Ukraine to investigate Democrats “was the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection.”

AD

Obstruction of Congress: This allegation is an entire section of the report, encompassing more than 50 pages. Democrats point out that an article of impeachment drawn up against Richard M. Nixon was for his failure to comply with subpoenas. Here’s their central allegation:

President Trump ordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct from the public and frustrate and obstruct the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry by refusing to produce to the impeachment inquiry’s investigating Committees information and records in the possession of the White House, in defiance of a lawful subpoena; directing executive branch agencies to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of all documents and records from the investigating Committees; directing current and former executive branch officials not to cooperate with the Committees, including in defiance of lawful subpoenas for testimony; and intimidating, threatening, and tampering with prospective and actual witnesses in the impeachment inquiry in an effort to prevent, delay, or influence the testimony of those witnesses.

Compromising national security:

By withholding vital military assistance and diplomatic support from a strategic foreign partner government engaged in an ongoing military conflict illegally instigated by Russia, President Trump compromised national security to advance his personal political interests. Faced with the revelation of his actions, President Trump publicly and repeatedly persisted in urging foreign governments, including Ukraine and China, to investigate his political opponent. This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.

This report touches on the fact that the Ukraine allegations stemmed from an effort to undercut special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation, but it doesn’t solve the internal debate among Democrats about whether to fold the Mueller report’s findings that Trump tried to undermine the special counsel into the impeachment articles.

AD

2. Trump’s White House gave Democrats their most solid evidence.

Democrats weren’t able to pin down that Trump himself explicitly laid out a quid pro quo with Ukraine when he held up Ukraine’s military aid and an Oval Office meeting. Because top Trump aides wouldn’t comply with subpoenas, the inquiry relied on people who hadn’t directly communicated with the president to paint a picture of what he wanted. U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified he heard this through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and others implicated Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, in the quid pro quo.

AD

So Democrats’ most solid evidence pinning the quid pro quos to Trump came from things people in the Trump administration did and said. Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky features heavily in the Intelligence Committee’s summary of why Trump should be impeached, taking up 10 pages. A key line:

AD

During a July 25, 2019, call between President Trump and President Zelensky, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for U.S. military assistance. President Trump immediately responded by asking President Zelensky to “do us a favor though” and openly pressed for Ukraine to investigate former vice president Biden and the 2016 conspiracy theory. In turn, President Zelensky assured President Trump that he would pursue the investigation and reiterated his interest in the White House meeting.

As Democrats note in their report, they aren’t alone in this analysis of the call being damaging for Trump. It was also referenced in many witnesses’ testimony as the moment it clicked that Trump had held up the military aid to Ukraine so that he had leverage to demand investigations. “I guess for me it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold,” testified Jennifer Williams, a Russia adviser to Vice President Pence. “There was no doubt,” Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House’s top Ukraine expert, testified when asked if he heard a political quid pro quo in that call.

Mulvaney did not comply with a subpoena to testify, but his public comments make their way to the top lines in the report: “At a press conference weeks after public revelations about the scheme, Mr. Mulvaney publicly acknowledged that the President directly tied the hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation, telling Americans to ‘get over it.’ ” (Mulvaney tried to walk back those comments later the same day.)

AD

The report also tries to counteract any attempts by Trump to push Giuliani under the bus, by using Giuliani’s own words. Here’s the tweet they held up:

AD

It won’t work! — Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) October 30, 2019

3. Democrats describe broad complicity in the Trump administration.

Pence. Mulvaney. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Former energy secretary Rick Perry. Senior White House aides. They’re all implicated in this report. They “had knowledge of, in some cases facilitated and furthered the President’s scheme, and withheld information about the scheme from the Congress and the American public,” Democrats write.

They rely heavily on the testimony from Sondland, who was the closest Trump ally that Democrats got to testify. Sondland testified that as he negotiated political quid pro quos with Ukraine, he looped in all of these senior officials. He brought emails and text messages to his public hearing as proof.

AD

In particular, Sondland stated his belief in a meeting with Pence that the release of military aid to Ukraine was tied to the Ukrainians announcing the launch of investigations. Sondland said Pence didn’t express his objections.

AD

The report’s authors include as evidence that Pence was in on Trump’s efforts the fact that the vice president spoke to Zelensky in September, after Sondland told Ukrainians there were conditions on getting their military aid — and that Pence won’t share the transcript of his call.

Pence has said he has “no recollection of any discussions” with Sondland before the Zelensky meeting.

4. Devin Nunes’s name is repeatedly listed in the report.

Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, is mentioned in the report dozens of times, and not just in his role as a counterpart to the leadership of the investigation. A former Nunes staff member is on the National Security Council, and the report says this staffer, Kash Patel, talked with Giuliani at a key moment in the pressure campaign and may have found a way to talk to the president about Ukraine, even though it wasn’t in his portfolio. The report also shows records of several phone exchanges between Giuliani and Nunes in April, as the campaign to dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine and oust the American ambassador there was ramping up.

The report doesn’t fill out Nunes’s role, but it provides some records that are consistent with the allegation by an indicted Ukrainian American, Lev Parnas, that Nunes was involved in this. (Nunes has said stories reporting this are “demonstrably false” but did not issue a direct denial when asked about his involvement with Ukrainians.)

AD

AD

5. They feel the need to impeach fast.

Democrats are pursuing Trump’s impeachment without hearing from top former aides, some of whom may have spoken directly to Trump about this and seem willing to testify. (We’re specifically thinking of former national security adviser John Bolton, who has said he’ll abide by the results of an ongoing lawsuit from another NSC official about what carries more weight, a subpoena from Congress or a White House ban on complying with that subpoena.)

The Democrats have faced some criticism for that, both inside and outside Congress. If they waited a few more months, could they connect the political quid pro quos to Trump without a shred of doubt? Instead, they are rushing to impeach Trump before it’s officially a presidential election year. To defend that rushed timing, they made an interesting argument in this report: that Trump might do this again if he’s not impeached ASAP.

Given the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through the courts. The evidence of the President’s misconduct is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress.

Of course, that argument ignores the fact that barring any major defections from Senate Republicans in a trial, Trump could be impeached by the House and remain president, free to negotiate with other countries as he sees fit.

AD

Here are three big takeaways:

The corrupt plot implicated multiple top administration officials and Trump allies.

The report goes out of its way to detail the ways the evolving scheme implicated top officials like acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

It recounts that when Ambassador Gordon Sondland worked in July to persuade Ukrainian officials to announce the investigations Trump wanted — into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in 2016 and into the Bidens — Sondland emailed all those officials to keep them informed.

AD

Sondland was trying to get Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to reassure Trump on their coming call (which would take place on July 25) that he would announce these investigations:

Ambassador Sondland emailed several top Administration officials, including Secretary of State Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Secretary Perry, stating that President Zelensky confirmed that he would “assure” President Trump that “he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will ‘turn over every stone.’” According to Ambassador Sondland, he was referring in the email to the Burisma/Biden and 2016 election interference investigations. Secretary Perry and Mr. Mulvaney responded affirmatively that the call would soon take place, and Ambassador Sondland testified later that “everyone was in the loop” on plans to condition the White House meeting on the announcement of political investigations beneficial to President Trump.

What this shows is that at a minimum, multiple cabinet officials fully understood in real time that an official act, one involving U.S. relations with a vulnerable ally, was being conditioned on carrying out investigations specifically geared toward giving Trump the political assistance he was demanding.

AD

The report also details that Pompeo was repeatedly briefed on the progress of the scheme going forward. This is the man responsible for implementing the nation’s foreign policies.

Trump’s “no quid pro quo” defense has been reduced to smoking wreckage.

The report does a good job in blowing up one of Trump’s biggest defenses: that because he told Sondland there was “no quid pro quo” on one of their September phone calls, that means it was true.

As the report notes of Sondland’s testimony about one of those calls (it’s not clear how many there were):

Ambassador Sondland also testified that President Trump immediately followed his stated denial of a quid pro quo by demanding that President Zelensky still make a public announcement, while the military assistance remained on an unexplained hold.

Yes, of course. The military aid was still on hold, and Ukraine still desperately wanted it, and Trump superficially told Sondland that there was “no quid pro quo,” while also directing Sondland to tell Zelensky that he must still do Trump’s bidding, but of his “own” accord.

AD

Sondland has testified that he concluded that Trump wanted him to convey the extortion demand to Ukraine the way “two plus two equals four.” In other words, Sondland concluded this because Trump told it to him.

AD

Trump has shown his corrupt undermining of our democracy will continue, posing a danger to the nation going forward.

The report strikingly portrays a president who recognizes zero constraints on his misconduct, making him a continuing threat to the country. As the report notes, Trump was emboldened, not chastened, by the fact that his campaign’s efforts to coordinate with and benefit from the 2016 Russian attack on our democracy — and Trump’s extensive efforts to derail the investigation into those matters to cover them up — ended with him facing no accountability.

Importantly, it was right after all this that Trump pressured Zelensky for another round of foreign intervention on July 25. The report describes this as “the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection.”

AD

AD

This is rarely discussed, but after Trump’s scheme had been unmasked, he repeated in reporters’ faces that Ukraine should investigate the Bidens. The report aptly casts this as a sign of the forward-looking threat Trump poses:

Trump does not appear to believe there is any such limitation on his power to use White House meetings, military aid or other official acts to procure foreign help in his reelection. When asked by a reporter on October 3 what he had hoped President Zelensky would do following their July 25 call, President Trump responded: “Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It’s a very simple answer.”

As the report concludes:

Faced with the revelation of his actions, President Trump publicly and repeatedly persisted in urging foreign governments, including Ukraine and China, to investigate his political opponent. This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.

The important point here is that Trump has made it absolutely clear that he will continue using whatever levers of government he can to corrupt the next election on his own behalf.

Crucially, though, Trump is simultaneously declaring the House impeachment process — and indeed, any and all House oversight — fundamentally illegitimate. As the report notes, Trump has “publicly and repeatedly rejected the authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his actions and has directly challenged the authority of the House to conduct an impeachment inquiry.”

AD

AD

In short: Trump is absolutely free to keep using government to cheat his way out of facing accountability in the next free and fair election, and the House cannot impeach him or even act to constrain this misconduct in any legitimate way that he feels obliged to acknowledge in the least.

The sum total of these postures, which Trump puts into practice daily, is that Trump does not acknowledge that he is subject to any legitimate constraints or mechanisms of accountability of any kind — he is simply not functioning as an actor in a constitutional democracy.

The remedy is plain.

Barr embodies the Trumpian edict that facts that undermine Trump’s defenses and unsubstantiated conspiracy theories are facts to be ignored. Somewhere, somehow, there are other “facts” out there that prove Trump’s innocence.

AD

AD

That mentality has enveloped the entire GOP, as we saw in House Republicans’ insistence on discredited allegations that Ukraine interfered in our election or that former vice president Joe Biden stopped an investigation into his son.

The believe-no-facts mind-set operates even when Republicans do the fact-finding or Republicans report the facts. The administration’s undersecretary of state for political affairs, David Hale, testified Tuesday that there is no doubt Russia interfered with our election and the accusation Ukraine did the same is fraudulent. And Politico reminds us of a Republican investigation that has gone down the memory hole:

President Donald Trump’s allies have defended his demand for political investigations from Ukraine by claiming that the government in Kyiv tried to sabotage his candidacy and boost Hillary Clinton in 2016. … But the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee thoroughly investigated that theory, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiry, and found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016.

Although House Republicans keep raising the name Alexandra Chalupa in the impeachment hearings, “an interview that fall with the Democratic consultant at the heart of the accusation that Kyiv meddled, Alexandra Chalupa, was fruitless, a committee source said, and Republicans didn’t follow up or request any more witnesses related to the issue.”

AD

AD

Yet that has not stopped Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) from making the ludicrous claim that Russia’s stealth campaign against Hillary Clinton is equivalent to individual Ukrainians’ public criticism of Trump. In an NBC interview on Monday, Burr asked: “Every elected official in the Ukraine was for Hillary Clinton. Is that very different than the Russians being for Donald Trump?” Yes, actually. Millions of people around the world had a preference for Clinton, but that does not mean they interfered with our election.

Burr blathered on: “You considered Russia meddling with just the preference they had before you knew the rest of it. Apply the same standard to Ukraine. The President can say that they meddled because they had a preference, the elected officials, that’s not the current people.” But Russia had more than a preference, as multiple intelligence agencies found. They had a Putin-directed plot to disrupt our election, a plot for which 13 Russian companies and nationals were indicted. And Burr’s own committee found no Ukrainian interference, something Burr chooses to ignore in favor of a specious comparison between Russia and Ukraine, something straight out of the Kremlin propaganda book.

Republicans’ contempt for truth will prevent a bipartisan vote on impeachment and removal despite the absence of any exonerating evidence to support Trump. The only remedy for the likes of Barr, Burr and House Republicans is a devastating defeat for Republicans in 2020, followed by professional discipline for Barr. In the meantime, keep in mind that every lie and every refusal to recognize undisputed reality confirms the GOP’s unfitness for public office.

“I believe that I am here to make myself useful — that I am part of this political process to make myself useful, but also that I was put on this Earth in order to make myself useful to others,” Buttigieg told more than 100 members of the mixed-race congregation who stayed following the Sunday service to witness the candidate field questions for two hours from Barber, along with other faith leaders, activists and voters. “These are the values that I was taught by my parents. These are the values that I’m taught by my faith.”

Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, has framed his faith as a counterpoint to the religious right. And scripture became the common ground between the soft-spoken mayor — clad in his signature dark suit — and the pastor with a clergyman’s collar and gold-accented clerical stole. When Buttigieg, arguing the biblical case for welfare, remarked that he couldn’t “count the number of times the word ‘poor’ shows up in scripture,” Barber supplied an answer. “2,000,” he interjected.

The 56-year-old pastor pointedly declined to ask Buttigieg about his sexuality, saying he would no more put the question to an airline pilot. “But I did ask him, ‘Could he fly the plane?’ ” Barber remarked, as applause rang out in the pews.

AD

Barber was hardly silent on the theme, however. He opened the service by denying that anti-gay hostility was pervasive in the black community. “Stop putting that on black folk,” Barber preached. “There’s some phobia among all folks.”

AD

He called the notion of a rift between gay people and blacks a “false narrative that was created by the National Organization for Marriage to separate people who, when they come together, have always pushed America forward, especially when it comes to addressing issues like poverty and health care.”

Buttigieg, addressing reporters after he left the sanctuary, said, “I don’t think I could say it any better than that.”

AD

In recent days, the candidate has suggested that his identity as a gay man gives him greater empathy with the experiences of other marginalized groups — a point that raised eyebrows among some members of the black community, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.).

But the argument resonated with Raymond E. Smith Jr., a black state representative in North Carolina who attended Sunday’s service and discussion. “Not a lot of white men know what it’s like to be discriminated against,” Smith said. “But he brings to the table personal experiences that would be beneficial.”

AD

Others were more skeptical of the mayor, whose experience in elected office is limited to stewarding South Bend, Ind., a city of just over 100,000. Buttigieg has faced criticism of his record on race and policing in his hometown.

AD

“Anyone can say anything,” said Yolanda Peterson, 36. “Let’s wait and see.”

Barber neither endorsed the mayor and veteran of the war in Afghanistan nor confronted him over areas where his policy prescriptions diverge from those of the Poor People’s Campaign.

For instance, the anti-poverty campaign co-chaired by Barber calls for a single-payer health care system, while Buttigieg favors a less sweeping overhaul and has assailed his left-wing rivals for their support for so-called Medicare-for-all.

“My plan is to make sure everybody is insured,” Buttigieg assured a woman who rose to describe the experience of burying her son, who had lacked coverage. Meanwhile, the candidate touted the benefits of public education by describing the value of “shared things,” even as he has criticized some of his competitors’ plans for tuition-free public colleges and universities.

Buttigieg also sat for a lesson of sorts, as Barber displayed slides showing maps aimed to illustrate the overlapping effects of voter suppression, poverty and other scourges. The minister said all presidential candidates were welcome to come to Goldsboro to discuss poverty. Nine of them appeared over the summer at a forum hosted by the Poor People’s Campaign in Washington. Barber is pressing for a presidential debate on poverty and racism.

Buttigieg called that debate “imperative” as he issued a “moral call to unity” designed to “confront all of the interwoven and interlocking sources of systematic poverty and systematic racism.”

“We’re going to need a leader who can bring us together from the White House in order to confront these concerns,” he told reporters before departing for neighboring South Carolina, part of a several-day swing through the South that will also take him to Alabama.

AD

AD

Polling indicates Buttigieg has his work cut out for him. In a Quinnipiac survey released Nov. 18, he registered at 6 percent overall in South Carolina, trailing former vice president Joe Biden, who enjoyed a comfortable lead, as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Forty-seven percent of respondents said they had not heard enough about the 37-year-old mayor to form an opinion of him.

If he is to energize the coalition envisioned by Barber — which cuts across racial and economic lines — Buttigieg has ground to make up not simply in the black community but among the poor voters whom the minister sees as their natural allies. In an earlier Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina, he registered at just 2 percent among those making less than $50,000 a year.

Barber said the conversation on Sunday represented a start.

“He came, he listened and he learned,” Barber said in a brief interview after Buttigieg had rolled away in his black Suburban.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: What emails about Ukraine does President Trump think, or hope, will never get out?

During two interviews with FBI agents and members of Bob Mueller’s team last year, former White House communications director Hope Hicks recounted the president’s reaction to the discovery of damning emails about the meeting his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort took with a Russian emissary at Trump Tower in June 2016.

“Throughout Hicks’ conversations with Trump, it was clear to her that Trump did not think the emails would get out,” according to the FBI’s summary of her first interview, which was released on Monday night in response to an open-records lawsuit. “Hicks’ impression was Trump meant the emails would not get out to the press, but he did not say that explicitly.”

Hicks said she thought the messages would come out eventually and warned Trump that they would become “a massive” story.” She wanted “Junior” – as the FBI summaries refer to the president’s eldest son – to give an interview to a friendly media outlet, where he could take “softball questions,” to minimize the fallout. “The President said they should not do anything, asked why so many people had the emails, and said they needed to let the lawyers deal with it,” Hicks recalled to the FBI.

There are no fresh bombshells in these new summaries. The juiciest material appeared in Mueller’s 448-page report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the memos about Hicks’s FBI sit-downs, which both occurred in March 2018, offer a revealing window into how Trump tries to control bad news. Trump’s unwillingness to rip off the Band-Aid and get out in front of bad facts has resulted in a drip, drip, drip of revelations that have clouded most of his tenure in office.

-- Hicks’s comments are newly relevant against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry. The White House’s categorical refusal to comply with subpoenas for documents, from phone records to emails, has made it harder for investigators to corroborate sworn testimony from witnesses about the alleged campaign to coerce Ukraine’s new president to announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden in exchange for a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid that had already been approved by Congress.

A confidential White House review of Trump’s decision to freeze the aid has turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, three of my colleagues reported last week. But none of those emails have been turned over to investigators.

Trump appointees at the departments of State, Energy and Defense have also defied subpoenas and refused to produce documents that get at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. They have justified doing so by making absolutist claims of presidential privilege that have led to protracted litigation in the courts. The White House is refusing to participate at all in the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment hearing on Wednesday.

For her part, Ivanka Trump repeatedly conducted official government business on her personal email account throughout much of 2017, sending hundreds of emails in potential violation of federal recordkeeping rules. The White House adviser did so after her father made Hillary Clinton’s private email use as secretary of state a centerpiece of his stump speech, egging on crowds as they chanted “Lock her up.” The House Oversight Committee has unsuccessfully sought to subpoena Ivanka Trump’s emails.

-- House Democrats are also quietly debating whether they should expand articles of impeachment to include charges stemming from the Mueller report, including the episode Hicks discussed with the FBI. “Members of the House Judiciary Committee and other more liberal-minded lawmakers and congressional aides have been privately discussing the possibility of drafting articles that include obstruction of justice or other ‘high crimes’ they believe are clearly outlined in [the Mueller report] — or allegations that Trump has used his office to benefit his bottom line,” Rachael Bade reports. “The idea, however, is running into resistance from some moderate Democrats wary of impeachment blowback in their GOP-leaning districts, as well as Democratic leaders who sought to keep impeachment narrowly focused on allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals … The debate is expected to play out in leadership and caucus meetings this week.”

When the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks to appear for a closed-door interview this June about the possible instances of obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller report, the former White House communications director refused to answer any question related to her interactions with Trump after Election Day in 2016. Citing a directive from White House lawyers, Hicks declined to answer 155 different questions from lawmakers, according to a transcript.

-- BuzzFeed News and CNN filed lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act to force the release of these FBI notes, known as “302 reports,” that were created as part of the two-year Mueller probe. The 295-page tranche that went out last night is quite repetitive, and the interviews are still mostly whited out. The media outlets pledged to challenge the heavy redactions as part of the ongoing litigation to obtain records.

Hicks left the White House last year and now works at the Fox Corporation in Los Angeles as a public relations executive. During another closed-door deposition in February 2018, while she was still employed by the White House, Hicks acknowledged that she occasionally told “white lies” for Trump. Hicks was advised at the beginning of both her interviews that it is a crime to lie to the FBI in the course of an investigation, which she acknowledged.

-- Hicks told the FBI agents that “Trump was angry, surprised, and frustrated” when Mueller was appointed as special counsel in May 2017. “The only other time she had seen Trump like that was when the Access Hollywood tape came out during the campaign,” according to the FBI notes.

“Trump thought the fact that the intelligence community assessed the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election was his Achilles heel,” she added, according to the summary. “Even if it had no impact on the election, Trump thought that was what people would think. He thought the assessment took away from what he did.”

-- Hicks was treated like family during her time as a member of the Trump inner circle. The president referred to her affectionately as “Hopey.” He called her more often than his chief of staff at the time. The onetime fashion model from Greenwich, Conn., whose dad was a top executive at the NFL, was tight with the president’s kids, who she had gotten to know during her work for the Trump Organization before the presidential campaign.

That’s how she ended up in the White House residence on the morning of June 22, 2017, with only Trump, Kushner and Ivanka Trump. “Kushner had a manila folder with documents with him and said to the President that they had found one thing that the President should know about, but it was not a big deal,” according to Hicks’ account. “Kushner told Trump that he, Don Jr. and Paul Manafort had attended a meeting during the campaign. When he started to open the folder, Hicks said, the president stopped him and said he did not want to know about it.” Hicks believed Kushner’s folder included emails about the June 2016 meeting.

The next week, on June 28, Kushner asked Hicks and his spokesman Josh Raffel to go to the offices of someone whose name has been redacted (perhaps a lawyer) to review documents. “Hicks was shocked by the emails concerning the meeting she and Raffel reviewed,” the FBI write-up says. “She thought they looked really bad.”

The next day, on June 29, Hicks joined Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the president in his personal dining room to discuss about the emails. “Hicks’ initial reaction was that they should get in front of the emails,” according to the FBI summary. “Kushner responded that it wasn’t a big deal, just a meeting about Russian adoption. Kushner reminded the president that he had previously mentioned a meeting, and the President said he did not want to know about it.”

When Hicks said the story was going to become “massive,” the FBI summary says, “the President did not want to talk about it and did not want details.” Trump then asked Kushner when his document production was due. Kushner told him it would be a couple of weeks. “Then leave it alone,” Trump told Kushner, according to Hicks.

Fast forward a week to July 7. Kushner and Ivanka Trump came to Hicks’s hotel room in Germany to confer about how to respond to a story the New York Times was working on about the Trump Tower meeting. The next day, while they were all at the G-20 summit, Hicks alerted Trump about what the Times was chasing. The president told her not to comment.

Hicks and Trump talked again later that day. “The President asked what the meeting was about. Hicks told him Kushner and Junior had told her the meeting was about Russian adoption,” according to the FBI summary. “The President said words to the effect of, ‘Then just say that,’ and dictated what she should say.”

When they got to Air Force One for the flight back, one of Junior’s representatives texted Hicks the statement that the president’s son wanted to provide to the media. “She took that to the President’s cabin and read him Junior’s statement,” according to the FBI summary. “He told her they should not respond. Hicks advocated for providing the full story. The President did not say what was wrong with Junior’s statement, but just felt they were giving the media too much. … After meeting with Trump about Junior’s statement, Hicks returned to a seat and started texting with Junior. They worked on the statement for a period and ultimately settled on the statement that went to the press.”

During that flight back to Washington, Hicks also went to Trump’s cabin to tell him that then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus knew about the emails. There are four redacted paragraphs about what happened next.

-- A reminder of what was in the emails: British music publicist Rob Goldstone, who Don Jr. knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, emailed the candidate’s son to say that he knew a person who wanted “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Goldstone explained: “This is part of Russia and its government’s support of Trump”

“[I]f it’s what you say I love it,” Don Jr. replied, “especially later in the summer.”

That’s how the Trump Tower meeting got set up. It wasn’t adoption.

During the transition, Hicks told reporters in a statement that the Trump campaign had “no contact” with “any foreign entity,” including the Russians. She told the FBI that she recalled talking about this with fellow advisers Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, Jason Miller and “probably” Kushner. “Hicks told the group she was planning to respond to the press and there was no hesitation or pushback from any of them,” according to the FBI notes.

-- Other takeaways from the FBI notes released last night:

1. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, told FBI agents in November 2018 that he informed Trump during the campaign that he had spoken with a “woman from the Kremlin” about the plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. “Cohen told Trump he spoke with a woman from the Kremlin who had asked specific and great questions about Trump Tower Moscow, and that he wished Trump Organization had assistants that were that good and competent,” according to the FBI summary.

“He also said that in his letter to Congress about the development, he initially wrote that he had ‘limited contact with Russian officials.’ But that line was struck from the letter. Cohen said he did not know who specifically struck it,” BuzzFeed notes. “It was the decision of the JDA to take it out,” the document says, referring to lawyers from the Joint Defense Agreement who represented the Trump family, Cohen, and Kushner, “and Cohen did not push back.” Cohen also told the FBI that he spoke with Trump’s attorney Jay Sekulow about pardons after his home and office were raided. Sekulow told the AP that Cohen's statements were false.

2. Former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates told the FBI that, if Rudy Giuliani had been the attorney general, some in the president’s orbit believed he wouldn't have recused himself, as Jeff Sessions did, from the Russia investigation. “After the recusal, he recalled conversations where people offered their opinion that had Rudy Giuliani been attorney general, he would not have recused himself,” according to the FBI summary. “Gates knew Giuliani had been the first choice for attorney general, but turned it down because he wanted to be Secretary of State instead.”

3. Former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein told the FBI he was “angry, ashamed, horrified and embarrassed” at how Jim Comey was fired as FBI director. “Rosenstein said he was asked during a White House meeting one day before Comey’s firing to produce a memo laying out his concerns with the FBI chief. He said he knew when he left the office that day that Comey would be fired, though he said he did not expect for his memo to be immediately released, and was surprised by the portrayal in the media that the termination was his idea instead of the White House’s,” the AP reports. “Rosenstein said he expected Comey would be contacted by either Trump or Sessions so a meeting could be scheduled and he could be fired in person. Comey instead learned of his firing from television while speaking with agents in Los Angeles.

“At one point during the interview, as Rosenstein was describing how he had ‘always liked Jim Comey’ but disagreed with his decisions in the Clinton case, the deputy attorney general ‘paused a moment, appearing to have been overcome by emotion, but quickly recovered and apologized,’ according to the FBI.”

-- The Post just published a six-part digital series to go along with the illustrated Mueller report. This is drawn directly from episodes detailed in the report in which prosecutors found possible evidence of obstruction of justice, as well as congressional testimony and Washington Post reporting. Dialogue is taken from text messages, contemporaneous notes and interviews conducted by Mueller’s team and the FBI. The digital project pairs with a graphic nonfiction book being published today by Scribner.

Attorney General William Barr listens as Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Nov. 26. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Attorney General Bill Barr has told associates he disagrees with the Justice Department’s inspector general on one of the key findings in an upcoming report about the FBI’s Russia investigation. Barr appears to disagree “that the FBI had enough information in July 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign,” Devlin Barrett and Karoun Demirjian scoop. “The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horo­witz, is due to release his long-awaited findings in a week, but behind the scenes at the Justice Department, disagreement has surfaced about one of Horowitz’s central conclusions on the origins of the Russia investigation. … The inspector general report, currently in draft form, is being finalized after input from various witnesses and offices that were scrutinized by the inspector general. Barr or a senior Justice Department official could submit a formal letter as part of that process, which would then be included in the final report.”

-- The Ukrainian government became aware of Trump’s freeze on military aid in July, according to former deputy foreign minister Olena Zerkal. From the Times: “‘We had this information,’ Ms. Zerkal said in an interview. ‘It was definitely mentioned there were some issues.’ … Ms. Zerkal’s account is the first public acknowledgment by a Ukrainian official that senior figures in Kyiv knew about the aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and that the Zelensky administration sought to keep that fact from surfacing to avoid getting drawn into the American impeachment debate. She said her own government blocked a trip she had planned to Washington to meet members of Congress in October, worried she would discuss matters related to impeachment and drag its president into an inquiry he has been eager to avoid. ‘They worried about this,’ she said of Mr. Zelensky’s advisers. ‘They said, ‘This is not the time for you to travel to D.C.’’ The cancellation of her trip was confirmed by Congressional aides.”

-- The Ukraine pressure campaign began as an effort to undermine the Mueller investigation. Rosalind S. Helderman reports: “As 2018 came to a close, the special counsel investigation was bearing down on [Trump.] … It was in this uncertain moment that [Giuliani] said he had the idea to focus on Ukraine. … The direct connection between the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine pressure campaign, often lost as the administration has reeled from controversy to controversy, shows the deep imprint the Russia investigation has had on the president. … Giuliani has repeatedly said the public does not appreciate the extent to which his work in Ukraine was driven by the Mueller investigation, rather than — as Democrats have alleged — as an effort to bolster Trump’s 2020 reelection.”

-- The Senate Intelligence Committee already investigated allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 campaign. From Politico: “Trump’s allies have defended his demand for political investigations from Ukraine by claiming that the government in Kyiv tried to sabotage his candidacy … But the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee thoroughly investigated that theory, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiry, and found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016. The committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in October 2017 that the panel would be examining ‘collusion by either campaign during the 2016 elections.’ But an interview that fall with the Democratic consultant at the heart of the accusation that Kyiv meddled, Alexandra Chalupa, was fruitless, a committee source said, and Republicans didn’t follow up or request any more witnesses related to the issue.”

-- House Republicans said Trump acted out of “genuine” concern about corruption in Ukraine and wariness about foreign aid in a preemptive rebuttal to Democratic allegations that Trump abused his power. Mike DeBonis reports: “In a 123-page draft report, GOP investigators assert that Democrats failed to make the case that Trump committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors ... Nor, the Republicans say, do Democrats have a basis for impeachment in Trump’s decision to spurn House document requests and witness subpoenas pertaining to Trump’s Ukraine dealings. Instead, the draft GOP report contends, the impeachment effort is ‘an orchestrated campaign to upend our political system’ … The Republican report will serve as an initial blueprint for the GOP defense of Trump…”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the majority’s report will be released publicly today. “We are putting the finishing touches on the report,” he told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. The panel is scheduled to vote this evening to approve its public release ahead of tomorrow’s Judiciary hearing.

-- Federal prosecutors will probably bring more charges against Giuliani’s associates Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas. From NPR: “A superseding indictment — which could add to or modify the existing charges — is likely, prosecutors said on Monday, but also adding that they're continuing to evaluate the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and FBI investigators are making their way through what prosecutor Douglas Zolkind called a ‘voluminous’ amount of evidence in the case — around 9 gigabytes' worth. Clearing their way through that material — which includes electronic devices, phone records, bank records and more — would set the stage for the next steps.”

-- The IRS whistleblower who raised concerns about political interference in the presidential audit program declined to voluntarily appear for a transcribed interview with the Senate Finance Committee, possibly because he was threatened with retaliation by his superiors. From CNN: “After raising concerns over the summer, the whistleblower met in November with Republican and Democratic staffers on the committee but has declined an invitation to appear for a follow-up … [T]he whistleblower declined the transcribed interview after an official informed the whistleblower that it could be considered a violation of IRS code to provide the committee with any information related to an individual taxpayer. Under IRS code 6103, IRS employees can be fired, fined or even jailed for disclosing taxpayer information. It is unclear what next step the committee will take. One option would be to issue a subpoena, but it is not clear that is the route the committee would take.”

Duncan Hunter leaves federal court after a hearing in San Diego.(Denis Poroy/AP)

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) plans to plead guilty to misusing campaign funds at a hearing set for 1 p.m. Eastern. “I think it’s important not to have a public trial for three reasons. And those three reasons are my kids,"" Hunter said in an interview with San Diego-based TV station KUSI. In July, federal prosecutors alleged that the congressman used campaign donations to finance extramarital affairs -- including trips, dinners and drinks -- with at least five women, including three lobbyists, a woman who worked in his congressional office and another who worked for a member of House leadership. Hunter told the local TV station that he “did make mistakes” but that “not a single dime of taxpayer money is involved in this.” He said he will plead guilty to only one of four counts against him as part of the deal. ""Whatever my time in custody is, I will take that hit,"" he said.

When he was first indicted last summer, Hunter called this a politically motivated witch hunt and said he was looking forward to the trial so he could fully vindicate himself. Initially, Hunter and his wife were charged with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including family vacations, theater tickets and school tuition. The couple allegedly agreed in electronic communications to claim that some of the expenses were intended to help veterans, even though they weren't. Then, in June, Margaret Hunter pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with her husband to spend $25,000 in campaign funds for personal use. As part of the plea deal, she flipped on her husband and agreed to testify against him.

Today's plea deal means that the first two members of Congress to endorse Trump for president in 2016 will be convicted criminals. Hunter and Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) came out for Trump in February of that year, about a week before Jeff Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump. Earlier this year, Collins resigned from Congress and pleaded guilty to insider trading charges. The crime he confessed to occured while he was standing on the White House lawn at a picnic hosted by Trump. These episode underscore just how swampy Trump's Washington has been.

Hunter didn't say whether he will resign as part of the plea deal, but that seems like a safe assumption. He's already facing serious primary challenges from former congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and former San Diego city councilman Carl DeMaio, Felicia Sonmez notes. Hunter won the congressional seat after his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., retired from it to run for president in 2008.

-- The North Dakota company that Trump urged military officials to hire for border wall construction received a $400 million contract to build a span of new barriers across an Arizona wildlife refuge. Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report: “North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel won the contract to build in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in Yuma County, Ariz., the Defense Department said, with a target completion date of Dec. 30, 2020. Trump has repeatedly pushed for Fisher to get a wall-building contract, urging officials with the Army Corps of Engineers to pick the firm — only to be told that Fisher’s bids did not meet standards. Trump’s entreaties on behalf of the company have concerned some officials who are unaccustomed to a president getting personally involved in the intricacies of government contracting.

""Trump has been enamored with Tommy Fisher, the company’s chief executive, who has made multiple appearances on Fox News to promote his firm and insists that it would do a better job than those the government had already chosen. ... Fisher has worked with some Trump allies — including former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach and ex-White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon — to build border fencing on private land using private donations. ... Trump has pledged to complete 450 to 500 miles of new border barriers by the end of next year. So far his administration has built about 85 miles of fencing, almost all of it in areas where tall steel bollards are replacing smaller, older structures that were there before he took office.""

-- A new biography of Melania Trump by CNN’s Kate Bennett reveals that the first lady doesn't just live in her own bedroom. She actually lives on a different floor of the White House than the president: “Melania Trump has her own quarters in the White House. ... It is true the first couple doesn't share a bedroom, according to several sources, and the first lady prefers her own large, private space in a suite of rooms on a separate floor.” Bennett also reveals that the first lady was “beside herself with guilt” after her speech at the Republican National Convention was criticized for including parts from a speech given by Michelle Obama: “Not only did Melania Trump feel badly for her speechwriter, she also felt she had let down her husband on what should have been her most triumphant speaking engagement to date. The truth was, sources conclude, it was Donald Trump that let down Melania Trump. A skeleton staff of political neophytes neglected to read Melania Trump's speech, much less vet it for content.”

-- According to the new book, the first lady suspects that longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone was behind the release of nude photos from her modeling days during the 2016 campaign. From the Guardian: “Bennett also writes that the first lady ‘still refuses to believe’ her husband played a role in the release. ... Stone denied Bennett’s claim while the White House poured scorn on her book.”

-- The Supreme Court heard a Second Amendment case for the first time in a decade, but the debate ended up being on whether a case concerning gun restrictions is still worth considering. Robert Barnes reports: “The controversy involves now-rescinded restrictions unique to New York City about whether citizens who have a license to keep a gun in their homes may transport them to firing ranges outside of the city or to a second home in the state. After the Supreme Court took the case to decide whether those restrictions violated the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the city got rid of them. Then the state of New York passed a law that would keep them from being reenacted. The unstated purpose of both the city and state actions might have been to make the case moot and deny conservatives on the court a chance to explore whether there is a right to carry a gun outside the home. … The arguments Monday suggested that New York would have had trouble defending the old regulations. But most of the hour-long discourse was consumed with questions about whether the court still has a live controversy before it, a requirement for rendering an opinion. The court denied New York’s earlier plea to dismiss the case as moot. It said it would consider the question after argument.”

-- Barr's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to let federal executions proceed next week by “setting aside” a district court’s injunction that blocks it from carrying out lethal injections as planned. Mark Berman reports: “This request, which came hours after an appeals court blocked a similar application, marked an escalation of the administration’s push to restart federal executions after a nearly two-decade hiatus. …. The Justice Department argued in its 38-page filing Monday that the judge’s interpretation of the law is ‘implausible.’ The filing, signed by Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, dismissed what it called a ‘flawed injunction against the implementation of lawful executions.’ [Barr], in announcing plans to resume executions, had said the department owes it to victims to carry out the sentences, though some relatives of the first inmate facing execution have urged the administration to call off the lethal injection and sentence him to life in prison instead.”

-- Trump recently gave states the power to ban refugees. But deeply conservative and devout Utah wants more of them. Griff Witte reports: “The governor, a Republican who aligns with Trump on most issues, wrote the president a letter in late October. He didn’t want to keep refugees out. He didn’t want to reduce their numbers. He wanted Trump to send more. ‘We empathize deeply with individuals and groups who have been forced from their homes and we love giving them a new home and a new life,’ Gov. Gary R. Herbert wrote. Such newcomers, he added, have become ‘productive employees and responsible citizens.’ They have been an asset to Utah, he said, not a liability. Republicans in the state legislature quickly backed up their governor, daring to defy a president who has repeatedly shown an unwillingness to tolerate intraparty dissent. So did Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation. So did Republicans in city halls. Democrats across Utah added their support. ‘I have to be honest: I don’t have any idea why it’s a partisan issue nationally. It’s never been one here,’ said Brad Wilson, the state’s Republican speaker of the House. ‘Regardless of political party, we value these people.’”

-- Ballroom dancers say a clampdown on immigration is hurting business. From the AP: “When no Americans replied to her ads seeking a dance instructor, studio owner Chris Sabourin looked overseas. But she was stymied again by a federal tightening of visa application rules she and others contend is hampering the ballroom dance industry. … Federal records ... show a slight uptick since 2017 in initial denials of O-1 visa applications from individuals with 'extraordinary ability or achievement' — the visa that many of the foreign dancers seek — as well as for O-1 visa applicants who were given a second chance to meet eligibility requirements. Representatives of the dance industry say they’ve seen the processing times for those nonimmigrant visas, which allow the dancers to work in the U.S. for up to three years, increase from weeks to months, with uncertainty the application will be approved.”

-- A janitor working for the Border Patrol saved and photographed migrants’ belongings that were thrown away by U.S. officials. From the Los Angeles Times: “While working as a janitor at the same facility from 2003 to 2014, photographer Tom Kiefer secretly collected the belongings and later began shooting them. … The first items to pull Kiefer’s attention were 15 to 20 toothbrushes. At the time, he didn’t think about photographing them. He just felt compelled to remove them from the trash. ‘When I started seeing a rosary, or a Bible, or a wallet, I realized that no one would believe me if I had not collected these items.’ It took about six years of collecting — blankets, cellphones, toilet paper, depression medication, shoelaces — before Kiefer began photographing. … Kiefer estimates he has more than 100,000 items collected and stored in his studio and other spaces around Ajo. The word he uses to describe how he copes with the magnitude of his collection: compartmentalize. … ‘Our government is actually taking away a Bible or rosary,” he said. “I mean, how twisted is that?’”

-- The United Auto Workers has bolstered its financial controls in an effort to prevent embezzlement and bribery that was uncovered as part of a federal probe of the union. From the AP: “The moves announced Monday by Secretary-Treasurer Ray Curry come after last month’s resignation of President Gary Jones, who has been implicated in the scandal. Several other union officials have been charged or implicated in the probe, which embarrassed the union leadership and angered many of its 400,000 members when it became public starting in 2017. Curry says the reforms will put checks and balances in place to prevent financial misconduct.”

-- Former president Jimmy Carter was hospitalized again to treat a urinary tract infection. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The Carter Center says ‘he is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon.’ The incident comes three weeks after Carter was hospitalized ahead of a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by a subdural hematoma, a collection of blood outside the brain, spurred by his recent falls. He was released from the hospital on Wednesday, in time for Thanksgiving, and there were no complications from the surgery.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Cracks in the Greenland ice sheet are producing massive waterfalls, raising scientists’ concerns for sea level rise. Andrew Freedman reports: “A cerulean lake consisting of glacial meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet, located about 18 miles from where the Store Glacier meets the sea in west Greenland, briefly became one of the world’s tallest waterfalls during the course of five hours in July 2018. The waterfall, like many others on the ice sheet’s surface, was triggered by cracks in the ice sheet. In the case of this one meltwater lake that scientists closely observed in July 2018, the water cascaded more than 3,200 feet to the underbelly of the glacier, where the ice meets bedrock. There, the water can help lubricate the base of the ice sheet, helping the ice move faster toward the sea. The observations of scientists, armed with aerial drones and other high-tech equipment, of the partial lake drainage that resulted could help researchers better understand how surface melting of the ice sheet could affect its melt rate, and improve global sea level rise projections.

“Scientists are keenly interested in how meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet — the largest contributor to global sea level rise — acts to speed up the movement of ice toward the sea by lubricating the underside of the ice surface. The new study, published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that scientists are underestimating the number of melt ponds that partially, and rapidly, drain into the ice sheet each year. This means tweaks may be needed to the computer models used to predict sea level rise from Greenland. This is the first study to show that partial lake drainage can occur through cracks in the ice, rather than overtopping or other mechanisms, which was previously the assumption. This means even more water is reaching the base of the ice sheet than previously thought.”

-- Trump revved up his global trade war yesterday by not only announcing tariffs on metals from Brazil and Argentina, but also by threatening even harsher penalties on dozens of popular French products. David J. Lynch, Rachel Siegel and Terrence McCoy report: “The administration said the moves were necessary because U.S. trading partners were acting unfairly to disadvantage both the country’s traditional economic pillars as well as its best hopes for future prosperity. … The unexpected announcement upends the Latin American countries’ 2018 agreement with Trump to accept quotas on their shipments to the United States instead of the import taxes. … Later, Robert E. Lighthizer, the president’s chief trade negotiator, released the results of a five-month investigation that concluded a French digital services tax discriminated against American Internet companies and should be met with tariffs of up to 100 percent on $2.4 billion in products such as cheese, yogurt, sparkling wine and makeup. The proposal, which awaits a presidential decision, threatens to intensify simmering transatlantic trade friction …

“Fallout from the president’s renewed embrace of tariffs could cloud prospects for future or ongoing talks with countries in Asia and Europe. … Administration officials worry that the French tax could set a precedent for other countries. Lighthizer said he may open investigations into similar taxes in Austria, Italy and Turkey. … The president’s enthusiasm for tariffs is not shared by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who has said they are making executives so uncertain about the outlook that companies are delaying investments and slowing the economy. … Typically, the United States provides businesses with some warning of tariff changes, delaying their effective date to allow goods in transit to arrive at American ports without being taxed. But the president tweeted that his tariff order was ‘effective immediately.’”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, hit with the new tariffs, has learned the hard way what so many others have discovered before him: A good personal relationship with Trump has its limits. David Nakamura and Anne Gearan report: “Bolsonaro and his country’s diplomats in Washington were blindsided after Trump issued a pair of early morning tweets announcing punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports … For Bolsonaro, a far-right leader who had patterned his campaign after Trump’s and aggressively sought to ingratiate himself with the White House, the tariffs represented an embarrassing reality check on his strategy of gambling his administration's foreign policy largely on good personal chemistry with a president who craves validation — but who views virtually all relationships as transactional and, potentially, disposable.”

-- This is not the first time that Bolsonaro has gotten burned by Trump. Terrence McCoy reports: “Over and over in recent months, Bolsonaro has been surprised and stung by Trump’s slights and about-faces. Trump told Bolsonaro this year he would back Brazil’s bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a promise Bolsonaro then touted as a political achievement. But then the U.S. recommendation letter leaked, showing that the Trump administration was supporting Romania and Argentina for membership, not Brazil. A few weeks later, the U.S. government refused Bolsonaro’s request to lift its ban on Brazilian imports of beef over safety concerns — again taking his administration by surprise. Now Trump is targeting one of the most important industries in Brazil, at a time when unemployment is above 10 percent and the economy has stalled.”

-- Stocks sank amid disappointing manufacturing and construction data and Trump’s escalating trade wars. Taylor Telford and Thomas Heath report: “‘All this trade friction is weighing on the manufacturing sector, reminding us that protectionism is not a victimless crime,’ said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Nine of 11 stock market sectors declined Monday, with industrials, information technology and real estate leading the slide. All but seven of the Dow 30 blue chips finished in negative territory, with Boeing, American Express and United Technologies the biggest drags.”

-- The Trump administration quietly released more than $100 million in military assistance to Lebanon after months of unexplained delays that led some lawmakers to compare it to the frozen aid for Ukraine that prompted the impeachment inquiry. From the AP: “The $105 million in Foreign Military Financing funds for the Lebanese Armed Forces was released just before the Thanksgiving holiday and lawmakers were notified of the step on Monday, according to two congressional staffers and an administration official. … The money had languished in limbo at the Office of Management and Budget since September although it had already won congressional approval and had overwhelming support from the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council. The White House has yet to offer any explanation for the delay despite repeated queries from Congress.”

-- China is using DNA to map faces as Beijing’s pursuit of control over a Muslim ethnic group continues pushing the rules of science and consent. From the Times: “With a million or more ethnic Uighurs and others from predominantly Muslim minority groups swept up in detentions across Xinjiang, officials in Tumxuk have gathered blood samples from hundreds of Uighurs — part of a mass DNA collection effort dogged by questions about consent and how the data will be used. In Tumxuk, at least, there is a partial answer: Chinese scientists are trying to find a way to use a DNA sample to create an image of a person’s face. The technology, which is also being developed in the United States and elsewhere, is in the early stages of development and can produce rough pictures good enough only to narrow a manhunt or perhaps eliminate suspects. But given the crackdown in Xinjiang, experts on ethics in science worry that China is building a tool that could be used to justify and intensify racial profiling and other state discrimination against Uighurs.”

-- North Korea said that dialogue with the U.S. has been nothing but a “foolish trick” and warned Washington that it could be on the receiving end of an unwelcome Christmas gift. Simon Denyer reports: “The North Korean regime has given the United States until the end of the year to drop its ‘hostile policy,’ come up with a new approach to talks and offer concessions in return for its decision to end nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in 2018. But a recent decision by the United States to postpone a joint air drill with South Korea clearly hasn’t satisfied Pyongyang. Ri Thae Song, vice foreign minister in charge of U.S. affairs, accused Washington of trying to buy time by calling for a ‘sustained and substantial dialogue,’ but he rejected this approach. … ‘The DPRK has done its utmost with maximum perseverance not to backtrack from the important steps it has taken on its own initiative,’ he said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency. ‘What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get.’ North Korea has a history of timing launches with an eye on international developments and even U.S. holidays.”

-- On the first day of the NATO Summit, Trump slammed French President Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of NATO as “very, very nasty” and “disrespectful.” Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: Referring to comments Macron made “last month in an interview with The Economist — in which Macron described the ‘brain death’ of NATO due to lack of American support — Trump attacked Macron during his first remarks on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London, calling the comments ‘very insulting.’ ‘You just can’t go around making statements like that about NATO,’ Trump said, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders Tuesday morning. Though Trump himself has long been a vocal critic of NATO — a combative stance that has alarmed Western allies and seemed to prompt Macron’s comments — Trump took umbrage at the French assessment of the alliance, and depicted France as the beneficiary of American largesse. ‘I would say that nobody needs NATO more than France,’ Trump said.”

-- Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pair of bills. One requires all consumer electronic devices sold in the country to be pre-installed with Russian software. Another will require individual journalists to register as foreign agents. From Fox News: “Government officials say the law will help Russian IT firms compete with foreign companies, which dominate Russia’s mobile phone market, Reuters reported. Another law signed by Putin Monday is a bill that gives the government the right to register bloggers, journalists and social media users as foreign agents. The bill is an extension of an existing law adopted in response to the U.S. Justice Department’s 2017 decision to label the Russian state-funded network RT as a foreign agent. The new law applies to anyone who distributes content produced by media outlets registered as foreign agents and receives payments from abroad. Individuals registered as foreign agents will be subject to additional government scrutiny.”

-- The American woman who claims convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with Britain’s Prince Andrew told the BBC that the episodes were “disgusting” and asked for support from the British public. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “‘This is not some sordid sex story, this is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse, and this is a story of your guys’ royalty,’ Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the BBC in an hour-long documentary that aired Monday night. … Giuffre — now 35 and a mother of three — told the BBC that she was passed around to Epstein’s rich and powerful friends ‘like a platter of fruit.’ She said she was trafficked to Andrew three times in 2001 and 2002: once in London at the home of Epstein’s girlfriend, once at Epstein’s New York mansion and once on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. ‘It didn’t last long,’ she said of the first of three alleged encounters with the prince. ‘He got up, and he said thanks, I sat there in bed, just horrified and ashamed and felt dirty,’ Giuffre said.” The prince has denied that he had sex with her.

-- The rape and killing of a veterinarian on her way home from work have shaken India. Joanna Slater reports: “The killing of the 26-year-old veterinarian in the South Indian city of Hyderabad last week has provoked outrage and anguish across India, the latest in a series of gruesome, high-profile crimes against women and girls. Police arrested four men and said they had confessed to the killing. Speaking in Parliament on Monday, India’s defense minister called it an ‘inhuman’ crime that has ‘brought shame to the entire country.’ … After news of the veterinarian’s killing spread, demonstrations erupted in Hyderabad over the weekend. Thousands of people protested at a police station near where the woman’s body was found and outside the gated compound where her family lives. In New Delhi, a young woman was arrested for holding a sign in a high-security area outside Parliament that read, ‘Why can’t I feel safe in my own India?’”

-- The Pacific island nation of Samoa will shut down government services for two days so civil servants can focus on a nationwide immunization drive as the country struggles to end a measles outbreak that has so far claimed more than 50 lives, most of them children. From NPR: “Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi announced the closure on Monday, saying the government is relying on ‘village councils, faith-based organizations, and church leaders, village mayors and government women representatives’ to persuade the public to get vaccinated. As a result, he said, all but public utility government services will be shuttered Dec. 5 and 6. More than 3,700 measles cases have been reported since the outbreak began in October, with 198 recorded within a 24-hour period. Fifty-three people have died and of those, 48 are children under 4 years old.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden may lose the Iowa caucuses. But, by betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas, he may still secure the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. From the Times: “If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests. … While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates. A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters. …

“Some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.) Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates. This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.”

-- In a wide-raging interview aboard the “No Malarkey” bus, the former vice president said he doesn’t need Obama’s endorsement, scoffed at the idea that Elizabeth Warren is building enthusiasm and accused Pete Buttigieg of stealing his plans. From Politico: “Biden reiterated that he asked Obama not to endorse him, and he stuck by that stance even when asked whether he’d want Obama’s backing if the field narrowed to three people. ‘No, because everyone knows I’m close with him,’ Biden said. ‘I don’t need an Obama endorsement.’ … Biden was asked about a POLITICO Magazine article that recently reported how Obama had confided in another candidate that his former vice president ‘really doesn’t have it’ when it comes to an intimate connection with voters. ‘He may have said that. And if it’s true, and he said it, there’s truth to it,’ Biden acknowledged on Monday before saying that he has ‘mostly campaigned for other people in the time I’ve been here. And I’ve never been in a position seeking the nomination where I have had the money and the organization to be able to get open headquarters all over the state.’ …

“Biden lamented media coverage that he said initially dismissed the durability of his candidacy because he was too moderate and didn‘t embrace policies like Medicare for All. Biden said the field was now moving closer to his views and away from the left. When asked whether he unintentionally set the stage for Buttigieg, who is leading in the polls in Iowa, Biden grew animated. ‘Set it up? He stole it! Set it up?’ Biden said of the mayor of South Bend, Ind. … The former vice president then accused the media of going too easy on Buttigieg, saying his opponent had once supported a more liberal health care plan but then pivoted … When asked about another polling leader in Iowa and elsewhere — Warren — Biden dismissed her rise and the notion that she had momentum behind her. ‘Look at the polling everywhere. Tell me. Tell me where the polling has manifested itself,’ he said. ‘She lives in Massachusetts, she’s invested millions and millions of dollars in New Hampshire, why shouldn’t she be known there?’”

-- Three state lawmakers acknowledge that lobbyists helped craft their op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all. Jeff Stein reports: “Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client. Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms. Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) confirmed in a brief interview that the lawmaker’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all was written with the help of Kathleen DeLand, an Ohio-based lobbyist. None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist.”

-- The Trump campaign denied credentials to journalists from Bloomberg News, accusing the organization of “bias” against the president. Kayla Epstein and Derek Hawkins report: “Bloomberg News faced a journalistic quandary when its owner, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, decided to jump into the 2020 Democratic primary last month. In a widely criticized decision, editor in chief John Micklethwait announced that the newsroom would continue its tradition of not investigating Bloomberg’s personal life and finances, and would extend the same policy to his Democratic opponents. The move was intended to avoid conflict of interest in the Democratic primary. Micklethwait noted, however, that Bloomberg News would continue to investigate the Trump administration. After the Trump campaign announced its decision Monday to bar Bloomberg News, President Trump took to Twitter to attack the news outlet and the New York Times for their coverage of him.”

-- The New York Times is overhauling its traditional closed-door endorsement process for Democratic presidential candidates and will instead conduct interviews with the contenders on the record and air parts of the discussions – along with the editorial board’s final decision – on its show “The Weekly.” (Politico)

-- A month after ending his presidential campaign, Beto O’Rourke is setting his focus on flipping the Texas state house. From the Houston Chronicle: “With Texas Democrats nine seats away from retaking the majority of seats in the Texas House, O’Rourke is trying to convince his donor base to send money to an organization called Flip The Texas House, which has targeted 17 House Districts in which Republican candidates won by fewer than 10 percentage points last year. More than half are districts in which O’Rourke won the majority of votes as he ran for U.S. Senate.”

-- With just a week remaining before the deadline to run for office in Texas next year, some of O’Rourke’s supporters are still hoping to see him jump into the race to unseat Sen. John Cornyn (R). They even commissioned a poll that shows he’d sail through the Senate primary were he to join the race. From the Dallas Morning News: “The poll also shows him in a near-tie, trailing Cornyn 46-42 at this point, which is far stronger than others already seeking the nomination. O’Rourke’s campaign operation has gone dormant. He didn’t respond to messages on Monday and hasn’t said lately whether he’s interested. … During his presidential campaign, O’Rourke said flatly and repeatedly that he would not even consider running for the Senate in 2020 … ‘I know it’s a bit of a longshot to try and convince Beto to do this, but it is clear to a lot of people in Texas that that would be the best thing for us,’ said Alan Metni, executive director of the Democratic Policy Institute, the group that commissioned the new poll.""

-- Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp isn’t expected to nominate Rep. Douglas Collins, Trump’s pick, for a soon-to-be-open Senate seat. He’s now facing heavy backlash – including threats of a primary challenge. Seung Min Kim reports: “Kemp is expected to tap business executive Kelly Loeffler for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) … The public outcry against Kemp and Loeffler from Trump allies has led some of them to threaten a primary challenge against the first-term governor, and they have urged the president’s supporters to flood Kemp’s office with calls pushing him not to select Loeffler. … Conservative radio host Mark Levin derided Kemp as ‘another Romney,’ referring to the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and current senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, as he accused the Georgia governor of being on the precipice of appointing a ‘RINO,’ a Republican in name only … The formal announcement from Kemp is expected on Wednesday, the officials said, so as to not interfere with Isakson’s farewell address on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon.”

-- In a big break for Republican hopes of holding the Senate, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) no longer faces a primary challenge in his reelection bid. From the News & Observer: “Raleigh retired businessman Garland Tucker is ending his campaign for the Republican nomination in the U.S. Senate … Tucker invested more than $1.5 million of his own money to challenge Tillis, who is seeking a second term in 2020. Monday marked the beginning of the 2020 filing period in North Carolina. Tucker, who joined the race in May, opted not to file. … The letter cited the attention on the ongoing impeachment inquiry into [Trump] as well as Tillis’ role as one of his defenders in the Senate as a reason for Tucker’s decision to end his campaign.”

-- An outspoken Holocaust denier, activist anti-Semite and white supremacist filed again for a Chicago-area House seat. From the Chicago Sun-Times: “Arthur Jones, of suburban Lyons, won the GOP nomination in 2018 because he was the only Republican on the 3rd District primary ballot. In the general election, he was easily beaten by Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., but received about 26 percent of the vote even after his views were exposed.”

Giuliani said he had the idea to focus on Ukraine. That November, he received a tip from a former colleague that it was the Ukrainians who had conspired to help Democrats in 2016, Giuliani said in recent interviews.

“I knew they were hot and heavy on this Russian collusion thing, even though I knew 100 percent that it was false,” Giuliani recently told conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. “I said to myself, ‘Hallelujah.’ I’ve got what a defense lawyer always wants: I can go prove someone else committed this crime.”

Giuliani’s efforts to undermine the special counsel probe eventually snowballed into the current impeachment crisis gripping the capital — highlighting how the pressure Trump and his allies put on Ukraine originated as an effort to sow doubts about the Russia investigation.

AD

“All roads lead to Russia,” said Paul Rosenzweig, who served as a lawyer on then-independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s team in the 1990s, noting that the theories about Ukraine have been described by former U.S. officials as Russian propaganda.

AD

The direct connection between the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine pressure campaign, often lost as the administration has reeled from controversy to controversy, shows the deep imprint the Russia investigation has had on the president.

Ultimately, Mueller would find that Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign were “sweeping and systematic,” but that the evidence did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia.

AD

Still, Trump’s determination to undercut the special counsel’s findings was so great that, the very day after Mueller testified before Congress, the president appeared to solicit another country’s political help in a phone call to his Ukrainian counterpart.

In his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump described the Mueller investigation as “nonsense,” emphasizing that it was very important to get to the bottom of what really happened.

AD

“They say a lot of it started with Ukraine,” Trump said in the call, which sparked the original whistleblower complaint.

The echoes of the Russia investigation can also be seen in how Trump has responded to the Ukraine scandal. As he did with the Mueller probe, the president has sought to undermine the investigation’s legitimacy, refused to cooperate fully and publicly attacked witnesses.

AD

Democrats are now weighing whether to include Trump’s conduct during both investigations in articles of impeachment that will be considered by the House this month.

“What Trump learned was always punch back. Demonize everyone. Fight to the last drop. Do what you want — it’ll work out in the end,” Rosenzweig said.

Indeed, the president’s latest message has been resonating: In recent weeks, his allies have increasingly been touting Ukraine’s alleged involvement in 2016.

AD

“I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,” Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Intelligence officials have concluded that it was Russia that interfered in the campaign.

AD

On Monday, Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.), the GOP chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC: “Every elected official in the Ukraine was for Hillary Clinton. Is that very different than the Russians being for Donald Trump?”

An early focus on Ukraine

Giuliani has repeatedly said the public does not appreciate the extent to which his work in Ukraine was driven by the Mueller investigation, rather than — as Democrats have alleged — as an effort to bolster Trump’s reelection in 2020.

While the impeachment inquiry has focused largely on the effort by Trump and his allies to seek damaging information about former vice president Joe Biden, Giuliani has noted that his Ukraine research began in late 2018, several months before Biden announced his presidential bid.

AD

AD

“The investigation I conducted concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption, was done solely as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges, that kept changing as one after another were disproved,” Giuliani tweeted last month.

The Ukraine theory had been floated early on by Manafort, recently released internal documents from Mueller’s investigation show.

In the summer of 2016, as Manafort faced building questions about lucrative lobbying work he did in Ukraine, he began to suggest to other Trump campaign aides that the Ukrainians might have been responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016, rather than the Russians, according to what his deputy, Rick Gates, told the FBI.

AD

Gates told investigators that Manafort’s comments attributing the hacks to Ukrainians “parroted a narrative” that was also advanced at the time by Konstantin Kilimnik, an employee of Manafort whom the FBI has assessed to have ties to Russian intelligence. (Kilimnik denies such ties.)

AD

As the special counsel investigation got underway in 2017, other Trump allies began promoting the alternative Ukraine theory.

In a text conversation with Manafort from August 2017 released by prosecutors, Fox News host Sean Hannity cited “Ukraine interference” as one of the issues he was highlighting to attack ­Mueller.

By early 2019, Giuliani began meeting with Ukrainian prosecutors. At the time, he and other Trump lawyers were bracing for the release of Mueller’s report and particularly what it would say about Manafort, who prosecutors said had breached his plea agreement by lying about key details of the 2016 campaign.

AD

Notes from Giuliani’s meetings, which were turned over to impeachment investigators, show he appeared to be gathering information that could help him argue that Manafort was set up when damaging information about his work as a political consultant in Ukraine had been published in 2016, forcing his ouster as Trump’s campaign chief.

AD

During this time, Giuliani has said, he consulted with Manafort — who was by then incarcerated — through his lawyer.

Giuliani was focused on the theory that the Ukrainian government interfered in the 2016 campaign through the activities of a Ukrainian American contract worker for the DNC, Alexandra Chalupa, which she has denied. This year, he met with a low-level Ukrainian diplomat who has alleged that officials at Ukraine’s embassy were feeding information about Manafort to Chalupa.

“I believed there was a lot of evidence that the [Democratic National Committee] and the Clinton campaign had a close connection to Ukrainian officials,” Giuliani told The Washington Post in October.

Giuliani said his consultation with Manafort also centered on trying to ascertain the veracity of a secret black ledger obtained by Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which the New York Times revealed in an August 2016 article. The Times said the ledger recorded $12.7 million in cash payments from then-President Viktor Yanukovych’s political party to Manafort.

AD

Giuliani suggested it was leaked by Ukrainians to hurt Trump — ignoring the widespread anger in Ukraine about the role Manafort played in helping elect Yanukovych, who was allied with Russia and fled to Moscow in 2014.

Manafort ultimately pleaded guilty to illegally routing $60 million in payments from his Ukraine clients through a series of offshore bank accounts and failing to pay taxes on about half the funds.

Serhiy Leshchenko, the Ukrainian journalist and former lawmaker who helped publicize the secret payments, has said he was motivated solely by a desire to hold Manafort and Yanukovych accountable.

“Giuliani’s entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts,” he wrote in an op-ed in The Post in September. He has denied allegations from Republicans that he provided the document to the Times.

Legal experts said Giuliani’s theories appeared to be aimed primarily at shaping public perception.

“It strikes me as less of a legal strategy than a public relations campaign to distract attention from the core operative facts,” said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who was involved with the early stages of the Russia investigation. “It is true that Mr. Giuliani is a lawyer. It does not mean that every endeavor he engages in involves providing legal services, rather than other types of services.”

However, Giuliani’s ideas strongly resonated with Trump, who has personally embraced the idea that Ukraine was the real culprit in 2016.

“They tried to take me down,” he told advisers in May, as The Post previously reported.

The president has even touted a debunked conspiracy theory that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which analyzed the DNC hacks, spirited the party’s server that was hacked to Ukraine.

“I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike. . . . I guess you have one of your wealthy people. . . . The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump told Zelensky. “There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.”

Trump told Zelensky he wanted to have Attorney General William P. Barr call Zelensky or his people and “get to the bottom of it.”

Former national security officials have expressed alarm at the traction of Giuliani’s theories on Ukraine, particularly the allegation about CrowdStrike.

“I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president,” former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said of Giuliani on ABC’s “This Week” in September. “It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again, and for clarity here . . . let me just again repeat that it has no validity.”

Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill testified last month that any action by Ukrainians to influence the 2016 vote in the United States was the work of individuals expressing policy views — rather than a ­government-led campaign of illegal acts like the one conducted by Russia.

“This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,” Hill said of the allegation that Ukraine also interfered in the election. “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016.”

Reprising tactics

Trump now appears to be applying the lessons of the special counsel experience to the congressional impeachment inquiry.

In the first probe, the president refused to be interviewed by prosecutors, but the White House did permit staff members to talk to investigators and turned over 20,000 pages of documents, exposing damaging information about Trump’s efforts to block the probe.

Most of the Mueller report’s second volume, which catalogues how Trump worked to undermine the investigation into his campaign, was built on the accounts of Trump’s own aides.

Still, Trump’s refusal to sit for an interview proved effective. Although the special counsel found that many of the written answers submitted by his lawyers as a substitute for an interview were “imprecise” or “inadequate,” Mueller chose not to issue a subpoena for his testimony, anticipating that it would lead to lengthy litigation.

The special counsel ultimately decided not to come to a conclusion as to whether Trump had broken the law by obstructing the probe. But, Mueller wrote, “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

This time around, Trump’s lawyers have decreed that there should be no cooperation with Congress at all. The White House has not turned over any documents to lawmakers and has directed key aides not to testify, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton.

Democrats in Congress now face the same difficult choice as Mueller — whether to allow their investigation to get bogged down by lengthy court battles to force cooperation or to push forward without additional evidence.

In another way, the president is reprising tactics he used in the special counsel probe, when he repeatedly attacked witnesses, comments Mueller said appeared intended to impede cooperation.

In recent weeks, Trump has heaped public scorn on officials who have chosen to testify before Congress, targeting former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, national security official Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and an aide to Vice President Pence who testified last month.

“It’s very intimidating,” Yovanovitch told members of Congress of Trump’s public attacks. “I can’t speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.”

And, as he did with the Mueller investigation, the president has kept up a nonstop series of attacks on the inquiry."

The Policies

IMPEACHMENT BUT FIRST, MADRID: Impeachment mania is about to hit the House. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is overseas touting another important Democratic priority: tackling climate change.

Timing is everything: The delegation of more than a dozen Democrats to the United Nations's Convention on Climate Change serves as evidence that Pelosi is serious about her promise to “walk and chew gum” on impeachment — and to not lose sight of issues that affect everyday Americans even as the House heads into one of the most intense weeks of the inquiry against Trump so far.

Key: “Members are here because climate change is a critical issue for the U.S. and their constituents,” a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world.""

a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world."" More: ""The House is continuing its work as the impeachment inquiry continues, including taking important opportunities like this one to attend the annual UN climate conference.”

Climate change has steadily climbed up U.S. voters' list of concerns: Some 72 percent of Democrats called climate change an issue that's “very important” to them personally — second only to health care — in a CBS News poll from September.

Eye on 2020: President Trump promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement to lower greenhouse gas emissions — but the pullout cannot take effect until at least a day after the 2020 presidential election. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration submitted an official notice to leave the accord, making the U.S. the only nation to abandon the global effort to address climate change.

Democratic lawmakers say they want to be clear that U.S. leadership on this issue would return if one of their candidates is elected to the Oval Office.

The message at the COP25 conference: “The U.S. is still committed to climate action, notwithstanding Trump,” Chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), told Power Up on Sunday evening from Madrid.

“The U.S. is still committed to climate action, notwithstanding Trump,” Chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), told Power Up on Sunday evening from Madrid. Castor, whose panel will release a report advising congressional committees on potential climate action by March of next year, said it's possible that the delegation will meet with other world leaders on the sidelines of the conference.

Busy week ahead: Upon the Speaker's arrival back in Washington, she'll hit the ground running as the House moves at a breakneck pace to investigate the potential impeachment of Trump.

Monday night: The House Intelligence Committee plans to review a report on the panel's investigation into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The House Intelligence Committee plans to review a report on the panel's investigation into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Tuesday: The Committee is expected to approve the release of the report, which is then “expected to be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump,” per our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian.

The Committee is expected to approve the release of the report, which is then “expected to be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump,” per our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. Wednesday: The House Judiciary Committee will begin hearings to “consider the historical and constitutional standards for impeachment,” Mike and Karoun report.

The House Judiciary Committee will begin hearings to “consider the historical and constitutional standards for impeachment,” Mike and Karoun report. Big picture: While Democratic leaders ""have not committed to a firm timeline, Tuesday’s meeting keeps the House on a trajectory to possibly approve articles of impeachment on the House floor before Christmas, setting up a Senate trial on Trump’s removal early in the new year.""

The agenda in Madrid is packed, too: Countries will be under pressure to make additional commitments to reduce their carbon emissions in the wake of a string of grim reports that show that the world is not on track to reach the Paris agreement's ambitious target.

Just last week the U.N. released its annual “emissions gap” report which showed that the Earth's average temperatures is on pace to rise 3.9 degrees Celsius, as opposed to the Paris accord's agreement to keep temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday in Madrid before the conference. “What is still lacking is political will... Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday in Madrid before the conference. “What is still lacking is political will... Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.” It's a priority for Pelosi: “Taking action to protect our planet is a public health decision for clean air and clean water for our children, an economic decision for creating the green, good-paying jobs of the future, a national security decision to address resource competition and climate migration and also a moral decision to be good stewards of God’s creation and pass a sustainable, healthy planet to the next generation,” Pelosi said in a statement this weekend.

Castor told Power Up that some Republican lawmakers were invited to join the delegation but all declined. There will be a small, relatively low-profile team of diplomats who will also be attending the summit on behalf of the Trump administration. They will be focusing on what Pompeo has described as “a realistic and pragmatic model” on climate issues.

“The U.S. team is set to be led by two career officials from the State Department: climate negotiator Kim Carnahan and Marcia Bernicat, a principal deputy assistant secretary,” per Bloomberg's Jennifer Dlouhy.

“And, in another shift, political appointees from the Trump administration also won’t be attending, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement,” Dlouhy reports.

Pelosi, who has made diplomacy a hallmark of her speakership in the Trump era, is not the only one who will be traveling abroad this week to keep a focus on policy.

Not impeachment: Trump will head to London for a meeting to mark NATO's 70th anniversary. Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey.

Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey. Trump also hit the road over the holiday, taking a page from former President Bill Clinton's playbook: to look hard at work especially on the economy even as impeachment loomed: ""Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware,"" per our colleague Phil Rucker. This comes after Clinton's former chief strategist Mark Penn visited the White House last month.

The Investigations

THE WEEK AHEAD IN IMPEACHMENT:

The White House stays away: “White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday,” our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report.

The full 5-page letter is largely an attack on the House's impeachment process, arguing that Dems failed to provide enough opportunities for Trump to participate.

The biggest question is how long this refusal lasts : “Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings,” our colleagues write. The counsel pressed Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to detail plans for future hearings and questioned whether the White House would be able to cross-examine witnesses, including those who have testified in the public hearings.

Members of the Intelligence Committee will have 24 hours to review the report: It will be available to them starting at 6 p.m. tonight, Mike and Karoun report. “Their exact findings are not publicly known, but the report is expected to lay out a case for Trump’s abuse of his presidential powers — that he used the promise of a White House meeting and the withholding of military aid approved by Congress to compel Ukraine’s government to launch politically motivated investigations into his political rivals,” our colleagues write.

The Judiciary Committee is back in the spotlight: Wednesday's hearing will be the first from the panel that historically writes articles of impeachment since the Intelligence committee began its process. Four constitutional scholars are expected to testify on the standards for impeachment — three chosen by Democrats, one by Republicans, our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report. The names of the witnesses have not yet been released, much to Republicans' frustration.

Meanwhile, Republicans continue to slam the speedy timeline: Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, ""attacked the timeline that Democratic leaders are pursuing, one that appears aimed at concluding an impeachment vote in the House before Christmas rather, he argued, than providing appropriate due process for the president,"" per our colleagues.

“They want to get this president right now before everybody completely sees through the process sham of the elections for next year,” Collins said. “So we’re rushing this.""

And one senator, John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), “said that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so,” our colleague Felicia Sonmez reports. NBC's “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd pressed the senator on the fact that this is an argument that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to see repeated by American politicians.

Lisa Page breaks her silence: The former FBI lawyer spoke to Molly Jong-Fast for a Daily Beast profile that details the personal toll Trump's taunts have taken on her, Page's concern over the future of the FBI and, most importantly, why she feels an upcoming report from the Justice Department's inspector general report will show she did not act unprofessionally or show bias against Trump.

Key quote: “But it's also very intimidating because he’s still the president of the United States,"" Page says of Trump's constant attacks. ""And when the president accuses you of treason by name, despite the fact that I know there's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that. To try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he’s not publicly attacking me.”

I decided to take my power back.” Per Molly, ""the president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally"" in October.

""If past is prologue, the odds of Trump intervening in Britain’s electoral politics again in the coming days are high,"" our colleagues William Booth and Karla Adam report. The president is deeply unpopular in the country and his words could roil a campaign that is supposed to render the path forward for Brexit.

Trump is not currently set to meet with Johnson: For his part, Johnson ""tried to diplomatically dissuade the American president from offering his opinions on domestic affairs,"" our colleagues write. ""What we don’t do traditionally as loving allies and friends, what we don’t do traditionally, is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,"" Johnson said.

UPDATE ON THE TRAIL:

Biden rides the bus: “Former vice president Joe Biden kicked off an eight-day, 18-county bus tour Saturday as he ramps up his campaigning in rural Iowa,” the Des Moines Register's Stephen Gruber-Miller reports. It's dubbed the “No Malarkey” bus tour after one of the most famous Bidenisms.

Warren's numbers tank after Medicare-for-all debacle: “Recent polling suggests Warren has sustained political damage from her health-care policy. After climbing to the top of the field by focusing on a message of overhauling Washington and Wall Street, Warren plateaued as her campaign became consumed with health care,” our colleagues Annie Linskey, Jeff Stein and Dan Balz report.

Key graf: “The irony is that a candidate whose political identity has been built in part on her reputation as a policy wonk — a potential president who boasts of having a plan for nearly every challenge facing everyday Americans — has been tripped up by a policy issue that has dominated politics and defined her party for years,' our colleagues write.

Buttigieg goes on the offensive over college costs and gets slammed: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg unveiled a new ad attacking unnamed candidates (*cough* Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders) for wanting the government to cover the cost of everyone, “including the kids of millionaires.” The message fits perfectly with the more moderate tone Buttigieg is striking, but not everyone welcomed it.

AOC blasts Buttigieg: “This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently endorsed Sanders, wrote on Twitter.

Harris's campaign gets torched in scathing report: “In one instance after another, [Harris] and her closest advisers made flawed decisions about which states to focus on, issues to emphasize and opponents to target, all the while refusing to make difficult personnel choices to impose order on an unwieldy campaign,” the Times's Jonathan Martin, Astead W. Herndon and Alexander Burns report.

Key observation: “The 2020 Democratic field has been defined by its turbulence, with some contenders rising, others dropping out and two more jumping in just this month,” the Times reports. “Yet there is only one candidate who rocketed to the top tier and then plummeted in early state polls to the low single digits: [Harris].”

The #YangGang breaks the bank: “Andrew Yang raised $750,000 on Nov. 30, his single best fundraising day to date of his campaign,” Politico's Zach Montellaro reports. The crazy part? The haul was not tied to a debate or one of those end-of-quarter pleas that flood inboxes."

Next week, we'll have another entry into this set, the release of a report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz assessing the origins of the Russia investigation that evolved into Mueller's probe. It has been hailed for months as being potentially explosive, depicted by Trump's allies and the conservative media as likely revealing broad malfeasance on the part of the intelligence community in unfairly targeting Trump and his campaign before his election as president.

Early indicators are that this expectation will be not be fulfilled. The Washington Post’s national security team reported last month that the report “generally rebuts accusations of a political conspiracy among senior law enforcement officials against the Trump campaign to favor Democrat Hillary Clinton while also knocking the bureau for procedural shortcomings in the FBI.” The New York Times reports that Horowitz determined that many of the most common theories among Trump backers about the origins of the Russia probe — that it was an attempt to spy on his campaign or that it lacked proper predication — will not be upheld.

We'll see what it says. On Monday morning, though, we got a glimpse of how the Horowitz report is nonetheless likely to be received.

AD

AD

The Daily Beast’s Molly Jong-Fast obtained an interview with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who has been pushed to the center of theories about a conspiracy to unfairly target Trump. She exchanged messages with another FBI employee, former special agent Peter Strzok, in which the pair discussed the investigation into Russian interference — which Strzok led — and in which they disparaged Trump himself before the 2016 election. As a result of those interactions, Strzok was removed from Mueller’s team early in the investigation.

A separate report from the inspector general released in June 2018 determined that the discussions were “antithetical to the core values of the FBI” and threatened the bureau’s “reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence,” but that there was nonetheless no evidence that the pair’s disparagement of Trump affected any investigations.

Despite that finding, the Strzok-Page texts have become a central component of theories about how Trump was unfairly targeted. The Justice Department initially released a subset of the messages focused on disparaging Trump, while others, released later, were culled to suggest nefarious activity. None has become more commonly cited than one in which Strzok refers to an “insurance policy” in the event Trump were to win the election.

AD

AD

The Page interview was the first time she’d presented her experiences in the media. She expressed frustration at how the interactions were framed and at the way in which her romantic relationship with Strzok became an undercurrent of criticism of what they’d done. She told Jong-Fast it was Trump’s depiction of the two in that context at a rally in Minnesota that spurred her to speak to the media.

That, unsurprisingly, was also the context in which the interview with Page was presented by the hosts of “Fox & Friends” on Monday.

Page is “one of the so-called FBI lovebirds,” host Steve Doocy said to introduce the segment, echoing a line used by Trump. (The Fox News show is, of course, almost unfailingly aligned with Trump’s political rhetoric.) He suggested there was something suspect about the timing of the Page interview: “A lot of people say, why is she done being quiet the week before the IG report comes out?”

AD

AD

The hosts walked through the interview briefly, at one point quoting Page’s response to Trump’s targeting of her.

“The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world. He's demeaning me and my career. It's sickening,” Page said, as quoted by host Brian Kilmeade. “But it's the president's belief that he was part of possibly a plot to upend his presidency ahead of time,” he then added. “And I think it's safe to say he's a little ticked.""

A bit later, he criticizes Jong-Fast for not pressing Page harder. Page notes that the Russia probe began with the revelation that a Trump campaign adviser named George Papadopoulos had been informed by a London-based professor that Russia had emails incriminating Clinton. He later told an Australian diplomat about that conversation over drinks, which the FBI learned about in July after WikiLeaks began releasing information stolen from the Democratic National Committee and the Australian government conveyed what it had learned.

AD

AD

“Page says, ‘The FBI gets the predication to look into Trump by George Papadopoulos, which starts the whole Russia investigation,’” Kilmeade said. “Which goes back to the biggest questions people have: Who was talking to George Papadopoulos? Where is this professor that started this whole thing? Where’s the ambassador that meets him by chance in a bar? This goes back into it. And there’s no follow-up question from the Daily Beast reporter.”

Perhaps because all of this has been well established. In 2017, Papadopoulos admitted to having lied to federal investigators about his interactions with the professor, Joseph Mifsud. He admitted further that Mifsud took an interest in him only after learning he’d been tapped by the Trump campaign. After serving a prison sentence for lying about Mifsud and when he was told about the stolen emails — and before announcing a congressional campaign — Papadopoulos has publicly insisted that Mifsud was part of a plot to frame him, something Kilmeade is echoing given its utility in presenting the Russia probe as unfairly targeting Trump. But in a sworn statement (and as summarized in Mueller’s report), Papadopoulos had already admitted how his interaction with Mifsud evolved.

“Well, don’t forget,” host Ainsley Earhardt added, “they were talking about in those text messages the insurance policy. If Hillary Clinton had won, none of this would have even come to light.""

AD

AD

This is, again, one of the central misrepresentations of the Strzok-Page texts (including, again, by Trump).

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,” Strzok wrote on Aug. 15, 2016. “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before 40.""

The context for the message was the referenced meeting with then-FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. The group was discussing how aggressively to pursue an investigation into Russian interference, with Page, suggesting that they move slowly since Trump was unlikely to win. Moving slowly had a specific rationale: Doing so would allow the FBI to better protect its sources. Strzok disagreed, suggesting they needed to move quickly just in case Trump did win — something that seemed as unlikely in August 2016 as a 40-year-old suddenly dropping dead. If Trump won, they’d need to have vetted his possible team in case any were compromised, something that required moving fast and potentially burning sources. Not likely, but, then, 40-year-olds have life insurance policies just in case.

AD

AD

That explanation makes more sense than the Earhardt-Trump explanation, which isolates “insurance policy” to suggest that Page and Strzok wanted to use the Russia investigation as a way to pressure Trump after he won. Why, if the goal was to have leverage over Trump, didn’t they simply release what they had before the election to keep him from winning? By mid-September, Trump and Clinton were nearly tied in the polls, as they were shortly before the election. Why not interfere at one of those points? There was a public acknowledgment of questions about one of the candidates right before the 2016 election, of course — targeting Clinton.

Again, Earhardt is blithely reiterating a theory that’s already been explained. The explanation is inconvenient to the idea that Trump was unfairly targeted, though, so it’s set aside in favor of the insinuation — assuming the Fox hosts have ever even been exposed to the explanation.

On Twitter, Trump ally Charlie Kirk offered his own conspiracy theory about the Page-Strzok text messages.

AD

AD

“Did you know,” he wrote, “Robert Mueller’s office deleted 19,000 text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok""? What, he continued, “were they trying to cover up?""

The answer is simple: Nothing, because he’s wrong. There weren’t 19,000 deleted messages but, instead, 19,000 messages that weren’t saved using the bureau’s established protocol for capturing messages because of a technical glitch. Most of those messages were nonetheless later recovered. Messages the pair exchanged on iPhones issued when they began working for Mueller were not stored, though the messages on Strzok’s phone were reviewed and determined not to be substantive. That review, mind you, happened after Strzok was removed from the team out of concern about his past exchanges with Page.

This, too, was known before Monday. But it’s not part of the story that Kirk and Trump and the “Fox & Friends” team want to tell. They, instead, pick out particular things from that vast buffet — after-the-fact claims by Papadopoulos, later-debunked news articles about deleted text messages, Trump’s own rhetoric — and lift them up to suggest that questions about Russian interference in 2016 were always about stopping Trump."

THE KEY

Massive voting machine failures in a Pennsylvania county in November are giving election security advocates fresh ammunition to call for nationwide paper ballots.

The problems, which may have been caused by a software glitch, resulted in some Northampton County residents who tried to vote straight-ticket Democrat initially registering as straight-ticket Republican. It also incorrectly showed a Republican judicial candidate winning by a nearly statistically impossible margin, the New York Times’ Nick Corasaniti reports.

In this case, voters got lucky. The county had paper backups for all the votes the machine counted incorrectly. They showed the Democrat judicial candidate Abe Kassis — who the computer tally said got just 164 votes out of 55,000 ballots — actually narrowly won the race.

But about 16 million Americans spread across eight states won’t have a paper backup for their votes in 2020. That means a similar software glitch or a malicious hack by Russia or another U.S. adversary could cause mass uncertainty about an election’s outcome or even result in the wrong candidate taking office.

Even in Pennsylvania, it could have been different. The machines that malfunctioned in November were just purchased this year in response to a statewide mandate to upgrade to new voting machines with paper records.

Election security hawks have been pushing the importance of paper backups since 2016, when Russia probed election systems across more than a dozen states and penetrated systems in Illinois and Florida, according to the Mueller report. But even in 2016 there's no evidence any votes were counted incorrectly.

That's why the Pennsylvania debacle offers stark new evidence for how badly things could go wrong with no paper backups in place, degrading public faith in elections.

“People were questioning, and even I questioned, that if some of the numbers are wrong, how do we know that there aren’t mistakes with anything else?” Matthew Munsey, the chairman of the Northampton County Democrats, told Nick.

Lee Snover, chairwoman of the county Republicans, was just as worried. “There are concerns for 2020. Nothing went right on Election Day. Everything went wrong. That’s a problem,” she said.

Officials haven’t determined what caused the failures, but a senior intelligence official who focuses on election security told Nick there were “no visible signs of outside meddling by any foreign actors.” The miscount shows, however, how voting machine vulnerabilities could be exploited by Russia, China or Iran — which U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies said last month are all eager to interfere in the 2020 contest.

Presidential candidates were quick to make that connection.

Here’s Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who sponsored the main Senate bill that would deliver more election security money to states in exchange for paper ballots and other fixes.

All you have to do is read this to see why I’m focused on election security & passing my bills for back-up paper ballots & systematic audits. As Fiona Hill said, Russia is “gearing up.” And that’s just one possibility. https://t.co/4r3uJibzTS via @NYTimes — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) November 30, 2019

Here’s Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who dropped out of the race this morning:

Elections are the foundation of our democracy. It's far past time for us to invest in new equipment, poll worker training, and protections for our election systems from both physical and cyber threats. https://t.co/muBHVtQMcp — Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) November 30, 2019

House Democrats have passed bills that would require paper backups for all votes and deliver $600 million for states to upgrade voting machines and add other cybersecurity protections. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has blocked any bills that mandate specific election security fixes.

Some House Democrats were quick to seize on the Pennsylvania debacle to push the Senate to act.

Here’s Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.):

One of the most common sense bills we've passed in the House is one that requires paper back up ballots for all federal elections. Read this and you'll see why! https://t.co/crIIlTn6gH — Tom Malinowski (@Malinowski) November 30, 2019

The story also sparked concern in states that will lack paper records for some voters in 2020.

Here’s John Ray Clemmons, a Democratic state representative from Tennessee:

This should concern (and, frankly, scare the heck out of) every Tennessean. Demand that your county’s #voting machines are up to date, produce a paper trail, & protected from hacking with modern, readily available and affordable tech (ie Albert sensors). https://t.co/wFpEb3Srwj — John Ray Clemmons (@JRClemmons) December 1, 2019

And Sri Preston Kulkarni, a former diplomat who’s running as a Democrat for a House seat in Texas:

We must have integrity of our elections, including paper records of every ballot and machines tested to ensure they don't switch votes.



In this case, they found the problem because 99% of the Democratic votes weren't counted. But what if it was only 5%?https://t.co/ycWQVOkUeU — Sri Preston Kulkarni (@SriPKulkarni) December 1, 2019

Other states where some voters will lack paper records in 2020 are Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey and Mississippi, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.

Northampton also demonstrates the importance of automatic “risk limiting” audits after elections to make sure that paper records back up machine results.

In this case, there was such a wide margin of victory for the Republican candidate that it was obvious something was fishy. But if hackers or a software glitch caused a much smaller shift in votes, election officials might not have caught it without an audit.

Here’s Matt Blaze, co-founder of an annual challenge to find hackable bugs in election machines at the Def Con cybersecurity conference and a cryptography professor at Georgetown University:

The tally software clearly failed, giving the (apparent) actual loser a huge margin of victory (so large it wouldn’t ordinarily trigger a re-count). But an RLA WOULD catch this. So score one for RLAs. But... — matt blaze (@mattblaze) December 1, 2019

It’s HUGELY fortunate that this happened in an off year, relatively low stakes local election rather than, say, the 2020 presidential race. Assuming we actually learn from the experience. — matt blaze (@mattblaze) December 1, 2019

PINGED: The Trump administration is considering tightening Commerce Department rules to restrict sales of U.S. technology to Huawei even if that technology is in products manufactured outside the United States, two sources told Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld at Reuters.

The move follows a massive crackdown on U.S. companies selling directly to Huawei, which officials say could abet Chinese spying.

It could appeal to congressional China hawks who have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to keep U.S. technology out of Huawei's hands as it tries to dominate the market for next-generation 5G wireless networks. But it ""would be poorly received by U.S. allies and U.S. companies,” Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson told Reuters.

The potential change follows the Trump administration's decision last week to delay a blanket ban on most U.S. companies selling parts to Huawei for another 90 days.

Huawei and the Commerce department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

Officials at the agency also want to know why WhatsApp executives, including CEO Will Cathcart, failed to mention the spyware attack when they met with Indian leaders in July and September. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, is suing NSO for the alleged hacks which affected roughly 1,400 users globally, including many journalists and activists.

The Indian government is also seeking answers from NSO on the malware attacks, Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. NSO has denied any wrongdoing.

PWNED: Just one-third of 2020 presidential campaigns are automatically rejecting or quarantining emails that come from suspicious domains and could be part of a phishing attack, TechCrunch's Zack Whittaker reports.

Candidates whose campaigns aren’t automatically rejecting suspicious emails include President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). That could put the campaigns at a higher risk of opening malware-laden phishing emails like the one that Russia used to target Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account in 2016.

“When a campaign doesn’t have the basics in place, they are leaving their front door unlocked,” Armen Najarian, chief identity officer at Agari, an email security company told Zack.

Campaigns for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are among those automatically rejecting or quarantining suspicious emails using a tool called DMARC, which verifies a sender's email is legitimate and rejects emails that may be spoofing a real email in order to trick the recipient. That's an increase from May, when Agari researchers found that only Warren was using DMARC to block spoofed emails.

THE BIG IDEA: A decade that began with the Arab Spring is ending with street protests from Asia to South America and the Middle East.

Violent clashes between police and people across the planet foreshadow what will almost certainly be another volatile decade for geopolitics. The United States will need to contend in the 2020s with the growing risk of war with Iran, plus an expansionist China, a revanchist Russia and deepening cooperation between those strategic foes.

When you widen the aperture, recent demonstrations underscore not just a pervasive discontent with authoritarian regimes but also the simmering anti-elite sentiments that led to Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

The resignation on Sunday of embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi amid sustained protests for sweeping reform has set the stage for a new political crisis as the ruling class scrambles to address demonstrators’ grievances. A human rights official said more than 430 demonstrators have been killed during two months of unrest. Thousands of demonstrators are still camped out in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. This is the biggest challenge to Iraq’s political order since the U.S.-led coalition topped Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Across the border, the Iranian regime is using more violence than at any time since the Islamist revolution four decades ago to repress protests. Between 180 to 450 people, and possibly hundreds more, have reportedly been killed since the government, facing pressure from punishing U.S. sanctions, jacked up gas prices two weeks ago. Another 2,000 have been wounded and 7,000 more have been detained, according to some reports.

The last wave of major protests, which led to at least 72 people being killed, was in 2009 after a contested election. Mir Hossein Mousavi, the 77-year-old opposition leader who “lost” that election and has been under house arrest, released a rare statement on Saturday that compared this most recent crackdown to Black Friday in September 1978 when the Shah’s soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in Jaleh Square, a spark that ignited the revolution.

Meanwhile, in Lebanon, members of the military formed a human chain on Sunday near the presidential palace outside Beirut to prevent violent clashes from breaking out between rival Lebanese protesters as a stalemate over forming a new government continues. Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned about a month ago in the face of protests accusing the elite of corruption and economic mismanagement, but President Michel Aoun has not formally begun the process of forming a new government.

-- In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully in one of several authorized rallies on Sunday were dispersed with tear gas, ending a rare period of peace amid half a year of pro-democracy protests in the territory.

“The march in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side of the city had a clear message: The five demands of the protest movement, including universal suffrage and an investigation into the Hong Kong police, are not to be forgotten,” Shibani Mahtani reports from the ground. “Protesters including the elderly and children, some of whom were carrying banners calling for the end of the Chinese Communist Party, said their fight must go on despite several key successes. Residents voted overwhelmingly for pro-democracy candidates in local elections last week in what was widely interpreted as a resounding message of support for the cause. Those winners now control 17 out of Hong Kong’s 18 electoral districts.”

These protests began in June when the government took up a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, which would have undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy. The government withdrew that proposal, but that’s only one of the five demands. One of the other four is an independent investigation into police conduct. Authorities have resisted any accountability.

Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, endorsed an independent investigation into police brutality over the weekend. “I appeal to the government to take important confidence-building measures, including a proper independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police,” Bachelet wrote on Saturday in the South China Morning Post. The Chinese government criticized her comments as “inappropriate” and said her op-ed would “embolden the rioters.” (The communists derisively refer to the pro-democracy activists as rioters.)

-- South America is facing its most widespread outbreak of popular uprisings this autumn since the Cold War, from the Caribbean coast to Patagonia. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier recently explored the causes: “In Chile, fury over a pocketbook issue — a subway fare increase — has snowballed into a deeper movement against elites and a right-leaning, democratically elected government. In Peru, the street rose up to back President Martín Vizcarra in his crusade to close down a corrupt Congress. In Ecuador, indigenous groups and left-leaning students pressured their government into restoring gasoline subsidies. In Bolivia, pro-democracy and right-wing forces drove power-clinging president Evo Morales from office after his socialists stood accused of stealing an election. In Venezuela, an outlier in the current protests, a starving nation has risen up — unsuccessfully, so far — against a socialist dictatorship accused of destroying the economy.

“But all of these events are taking place against a shared backdrop: the painful aftermath of a commodities boom. Rising prices of the fuels, minerals and crops at the heart of the region’s resource-rich economies at the start of the 21st century helped lift millions out of poverty. The revenue also raised expectations — expectations now unmet in the half-dozen years since the boom went bust. A new middle class fears slipping back down the socioeconomic ladder. As nations tighten their belts in leaner times, the pressure is hitting the poor and middle classes disproportionately, while elites are largely shielded — fueling grass-roots rage. Add weak institutions, structural inequality, political polarization and a corrupt ruling class unwilling to cede power, and you have a recipe for regional unrest.”

-- There’s an inspiration factor at play, as the wind of freedom blows across borders. Though their grievances are quite different, for example, activists in the streets of Santiago have cited the struggle in Hong Kong and adopted many tactics of those protesters. Democracy has been in recession for years now, but the streets are speaking. What will come of the unrest? The truth is that we don’t know how these stories will end, which is always true but still always scary.

-- Recent scenes from Hong Kong to Iran are a testament to the power and possibility of American moral leadership when Washington gets engaged. Under bipartisan pressure, on Thanksgiving eve, Trump signed into law the resolution that passed Congress with only one holdout to offer support for the people of Hong Kong. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters celebrated by draping themselves in American flags and singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Many waved posters thanking Trump by name.

-- In protest, China announced today it will suspend U.S. Navy port visits to Hong Kong and sanction several pro-democracy organizations after Trump signed the bill. “While the nature of the sanctions remained unclear, the move appeared to back up Chinese threats that the U.S. would bear the costs of the decision,” per the AP. “The steps are ‘in response to the U.S.’s unreasonable behavior,’ foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, adding that the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act ‘seriously interfered’ in China’s internal affairs. … Along with suspending visits by official U.S. military ships and aircraft, Hua said China would sanction organizations including the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, Human Rights Watch, the International Republican Institute, Freedom House, and others that she said had ‘performed badly’ in the Hong Kong unrest.”

-- Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign is achieving its desired impact of punishing Iran, but it remains to be seen whether this will bring Tehran to the table or prompt the theocrats who are calling the shots to lash out militarily. The White House announced late last night that Trump “discussed the threat from Iran” in a Sunday phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi, who is fighting for his political life and facing a possible third national election in a year, accused six European countries on Sunday of trying to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. “While the Iranian regime is killing its own people, European countries rush to support that very murderous regime,” Netanyahu said in a televised address on Sunday. Israel’s Foreign Ministry singled out Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Trump is meeting with the leaders of these and other European counties at the NATO summit in London on Tuesday and Wednesday.

-- A front-page story in today’s New York Times has details on how the Iranian government has massacred civilians: “It began two weeks ago with an abrupt increase of at least 50 percent in gasoline prices. Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders. In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos. In the southwest city of Mahshahr alone, witnesses and medical personnel said, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members surrounded, shot and killed 40 to 100 demonstrators — mostly unarmed young men — in a marsh where they had sought refuge. …

“Most of the nationwide unrest seemed concentrated in neighborhoods and cities populated by low-income and working-class families, suggesting this was an uprising born in the historically loyal power base of Iran’s post-revolutionary hierarchy. The authorities have declined to specify casualties and arrests and have denounced unofficial figures on the national death toll as speculative. But the nation’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, has cited widespread unrest around the country. On state media, he said that protests had erupted in 29 out of 31 provinces and 50 military bases had been attacked, which if true suggested a level of coordination absent in the earlier protests. … The property damage also included 731 banks, 140 public spaces, nine religious centers, 70 gasoline stations, 307 vehicles, 183 police cars, 1,076 motorcycles and 34 ambulances, the interior minister said.” (The Guardian also has excellent fresh reporting on the regime’s brutal crackdown in Shiraz.)

-- Ultimately, the repression doesn’t solve the underlying frustrations that prompted protesters to so boldly risk arrest across Iran. It seems a safe bet that there will be more violence in the streets going forward. “These riots are not the last ones and it definitely will happen in the future,” said Revolutionary Guard acting commander Gen. Ali Fadavi, according to the AP.

-- Looking ahead in Iraq, a showdown looms in parliament over who will now lead the fragile democracy. Erin Cunningham and Mustafa Salim report from Baghdad: “Abdul Mahdi was appointed after months of political wrangling in parliament. His departure, approved by lawmakers on Sunday, offers authorities a chance to begin enacting real change, lawmakers and analysts said. Iraqis are fed up with high unemployment rates, widespread graft and a lack of government services. … But parliament — which is made up of rival political blocs, none of which hold a commanding majority — is unlikely to agree on a replacement, some lawmakers said. Parliament has just 15 days to choose a prime minister, who will then be granted 30 days to form a government.

“The leaders of the two largest coalitions — Moqtada al-Sadr, a firebrand Shiite cleric, and Hadi al-Amiri, who is backed by Iran — have publicly split over the prime minister’s resignation. In a statement last month, Sadr vowed never to work toward a political consensus with Amiri again after the latter apparently backtracked on an agreement to subject Abdul Mahdi to a no-confidence vote in parliament. Amiri was a key leader of the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of Shiite militias that was formed to battle Islamic State militants and that has enjoyed considerable support from Iran. Iran has played a significant role in Iraqi politics since Tehran threw its weight behind the militias. But that support might have backfired. Demonstrators in majority-Shiite cities such as Najaf and Karbala have stormed or burned Iranian consulates and defaced posters of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. …

“Even as lawmakers paid lip service to the need for change, they conceded that a new leader would inherit a restive and fractured nation reeling from a security crackdown that appears to have only hardened protesters’ resolve. On Sunday, a demonstrator was killed by security forces in Baghdad as the sides clashed on Rasheed Street, officials said. Demonstrators have sought to protect the vast protest site they have set up in Tahrir Square and surrounding streets, which they have transformed into a mini-republic with art installations, medical facilities, restaurants and free libraries. Police have tried to prevent demonstrators from crossing bridges that lead to government buildings and embassies in the heavily secured Green Zone.”

-- The struggle between lower-case-D democrats and autocrats will persist in the 2020s. It’s a brave new world out there. Effective Sunday, for example, the Chinese government began requiring facial scans for anyone to be able to get a cellphone or SIM card. “The policy is part of a broader push by the Chinese government to limit people’s ability to stay anonymous online,” Quartz reports.

Starting today, an 1,800-mile pipeline is set to begin delivering Russian natural gas to China. The $55 billion project is Moscow’s most significant energy play since the collapse of the Soviet Union. “The Power of Siberia pipeline is a physical bond strengthening a new era of cooperation between two world powers that have separately challenged the U.S.,” the Wall Street Journal reports.

As much as Trump may enjoy the company of strongmen, and politicians in both parties preach isolationism and protectionism to soothe constituents who have grown weary of war and nation-building, the United States remains locked in an existential struggle with the dark forces of autocracy that dates to our founding.

-- Closing the book on the 2010s: It didn’t really sink in for me until Thanksgiving that this tumultuous decade is ending. It’s not that I can’t read a calendar. It’s just that there are so many unfinished storylines. Years from now, however, there will be television documentaries and books that isolate the 2010s as a distinct chapter in our nation’s history. If you could sum up the teens in one word or phrase, what would it be? Besides Trump, what do you think was the single most important story of the decade? Email me at James.Hohmann@washpost.com. I’d love to highlight the most thoughtful answers here this week.

IMPEACHMENT LATEST:

-- White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter last night that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday. Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report: “The invitation from Chairman Jerrold Nadler ‘does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process,’ Cipollone wrote. … Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings but asked Nadler to detail his plans for the upcoming proceedings, including whether he would allow further testimony and cross-examination of fact witnesses, among them those who already testified before the House Intelligence Committee. He also said Republicans should be able to call additional witnesses. … On Sunday, Democrats called on the White House to cooperate, suggesting an innocent person would have no problem testifying. ‘We’re certainly hoping that the president, his counsel, will take advantage of that opportunity if he has not done anything wrong,’ Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) said on ABC News’s ‘This Week.’ ‘We’re certainly anxious to hear his explanation of that.’

“But there is a conflict inside the GOP over the extent to which Trump and his congressional defenders ought to engage, even as Republicans signaled they will continue their aggressive campaign to delegitimize the process as corrupt and unfair. Speaking on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he understood why the White House might want to skip the Wednesday hearing, calling it ‘just another rerun’ covering ground already surveyed in previous Judiciary Committee hearings. ‘This is a complete American waste of time right here,’ he said. But he added that Republicans would be more keen to participate in future hearings — particularly one examining the findings of the House Intelligence Committee as prepared by its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).” Members of the Intelligence Committee are expected to review the draft of the Schiff report today and vote tomorrow (presumably on party lines) to formally transmit it to the Judiciary Committee.

-- Volodymyr Zelensky is stepping up his fight against corruption in Ukraine, despite the risk that he will anger Trump by doing so. Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern report: “By the end of this month, more than 500 Ukrainian prosecutors will be out of their jobs as part of sweeping professional reviews under [Zelensky]. Among the prosecutors heading for the exit: a key Kyiv contact for Rudolph W. Giuliani. The prosecutor purge is just one of several corruption-busting efforts set in motion by Zelensky. But it puts into sharp relief Zelensky’s twin challenges — trying to balance his clean-government promises at home with his needs to keep President Trump from turning against him. Zelensky’s bind is not hard to spot. … Now that Zelensky’s reform push is underway, some of those Giuliani-linked officials are in the crosshairs. A prosecutor named Kostiantyn H. Kulyk is one of the first. Zelensky’s new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka — ‘100 percent my person,’ Zelensky told Trump in July — last week gave a dismissal notice to Kulyk, a key player in the effort to provide Giuliani with political ammunition of dubious accuracy.”

-- Zelenksy pushed back on Trump’s claims about corruption in Ukraine: “If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us,” he told Time Magazine and three European news outlets in a sit-down on Saturday. “I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo.” He said that Ukraine still needs U.S. support to have a chance to get back the territory Russia seized in 2014, starting with the Crimean Peninsula. He said Trump calling Ukraine corrupt makes it hard to attract foreign investment. “When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals,” he said.

“Zelensky has already learned to temper his expectations,” Time notes. “He does not expect his first round of peace talks with Russia, which are scheduled to take place in Paris on Dec. 9, to end the war that has been raging along their border for the past five years. Nor does he expect too much from his Western allies going into these negotiations.”

-- Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers who has kept a lower profile than Giuliani, says he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a New York Times profile. Unlike Giuliani, Sekulow does get compensated for representing Trump. His son Jordan and his law partner Stuart Roth are also on the Trump payroll.

-- Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page spoke to the Daily Beast after two years of silence: “Page, of course, is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory became international news. They were hijacked by Trump to fuel his 'deep-state' conspiracy. For the nearly two years since her name first made the papers, she’s been publicly silent (she did have a closed-door interview with House members in July 2018). I asked her why she was willing to talk now. ‘Honestly, his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel’s back,’ she says. The president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally on Oct. 11, 2019. That was the moment Page decided she had to speak up. ‘I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,’ she says. ‘It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.’ ...

""On Dec. 9, the Justice Department Inspector General report into Trump’s charges that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign will come out. Leaked press accounts indicate that the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump. How does it feel after all this time to finally have the IG apparently affirm what she’s been saying all along? She said she wouldn’t discuss the findings until they were officially public, but she did note: ‘While it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don’t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people. The president has a very loud megaphone.’”

-- Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) claimed that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so. Felicia Sonmez reports: “‘I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,’ Kennedy told host Chuck Todd on NBC News’s ‘Meet the Press’ on Sunday. Todd pressed Kennedy on whether he was concerned that he had been ‘duped’ by Russian propaganda, noting reports that U.S. intelligence officials recently briefed senators that ‘this is a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine.’ Kennedy responded that he had received no such warning. … Kennedy argued Sunday that Ukraine’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign have been ‘very well-documented,’ citing reporting by the Economist, the Financial Times, the Washington Examiner and others. … Despite Kennedy’s claim, there is no evidence that the Ukrainian government engaged in a large-scale effort to aid Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.”

-- The only lawmaker involved in three impeachment probes said Trump’s Ukraine conduct is “more serious” than Richard Nixon’s during Watergate. From CNN: “Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who helped draft an article of impeachment against Nixon as a congressional staffer and served on the House Judiciary Committee during President Bill Clinton's impeachment, [said] that she agrees with [Schiff] that Trump's actions involving Ukraine are ‘far more serious’ than Watergate. Congressional Democrats -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and, on Sunday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- have compared Trump's involvement with Ukraine to the scandal that prompted Nixon to resign in 1974 rather than be impeached. ... ‘President Nixon's misconduct related to trying to use the levers of government to hide the Watergate burglary ... His misconduct had to do with trying to throw the election but at least it didn't involve involving other foreign nations,’ said Lofgren ... ‘If you take a look at the -- what the founding fathers were concerned about, it was the interference by foreign governments in our political system that was one of the gravest concerns. Nixon's behavior didn't fall into that range. So in that way, this conduct is more serious.’”

2020 WATCH:

-- Montana Gov. Steve Bullock dropped out of the presidential race this morning. He was the only Democratic candidate who had won statewide in a state Trump carried in 2016, and he was the only sitting governor in the race. Bullock said he does not plan to run for Senate. Dave Weigel reports: ""Bullock, 53, entered the race in May, arguing that a group heavy on Washington experience needed an outsider from a 'Trump state.' He rejected entreaties from national Democrats to run for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Steve Daines, telling reporters that he had no interest in the job. He affirmed that position Monday. 'While he plans to work hard to elect Democrats in the state and across the country in 2020, it will be in his capacity as a governor and a senior voice in the Democratic Party — not as a candidate for U.S. Senate,' said Bullock’s communications director, Galia Slayen.""

-- Former congressman Joe Sestak is also out of the race. Sestak (D-Pa.) launched his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination about five months ago, Felicia Sonmez reports.

-- Pete Buttigieg is still struggling to win over black voters. This weekend, he used a North Carolina church visit to issue a “moral call to unity.” Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: “The Greenleaf Christian Church is pastored by the Rev. William J. Barber II. Barber’s effort to revive Martin Luther King Jr.’s last major project — the Poor People’s Campaign of 1968 — has inspired a multiracial movement to oppose [Trump], with plans for an assembly and ‘Moral March on Washington’ in June 2020. Buttigieg’s decision to worship with the Disciples of Christ congregation underscored the task that awaits him as he seeks to convince voters that he can credibly lead a diverse coalition to capture the White House. … The 56-year-old pastor pointedly declined to ask Buttigieg about his sexuality, saying he would no more put the question to an airline pilot. ‘But I did ask him, ‘Could he fly the plane?’ Barber remarked, as applause rang out in the pews. Barber was hardly silent on the theme, however. He opened the service by denying that anti-gay hostility was pervasive in the black community.""

-- ICYMI: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is expected to nominate financial executive Kelly Loeffler to the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). The Atlantia Journal-Constitution broke the story Friday, and other outlets have confirmed it. This defies a pressure campaign from Trump to get Kemp to put up Doug Collins, who has been an outspoken Trump defender on cable television.

-- Google and YouTube took down more than 300 video ads for Trump that violated the company's policy. From CBS News: “Lesley Stahl asked [YouTube CEO Susan] Wojcicki, ‘Have you taken down any of President Trump's ads at all?’ YouTube's CEO responded, ‘There are ads of President Trump that were not approved to run on Google or YouTube.’ When pressed for an example, Wojcicki added, ‘Well, they're available in our transparency report.’ In response to concerns raised after the 2016 election cycle, Google and YouTube, like Facebook, keep a searchable archive of political ads that have run on the site. 60 Minutes reviewed the archive to learn more about President Trump's problematic political ads. We found that over 300 video ads were taken down by Google and YouTube, mostly over the summer, for violating company policy. But the archive doesn't detail what policy was violated. Was it copyright violation? A lie or extreme inaccuracy? Faulty grammar? Bad punctuation? It's unclear. The ads determined to be offending are not available to be screened. We found very little transparency in the transparency report.”

-- Another reminder that elections have consequences: The Supreme Court will today wade into the gun control debate for the first time in a decade, making advocates for gun control nervous. From NBC News: “The court has steadfastly declined to take up any gun rights cases since ruling in 2008's Washington, D.C. v. Heller that the Second Amendment provides a right to keep a handgun at home for self-defense, and later clarifying in 2010's McDonald v. Chicago that the right applies nationwide. Now the court's willingness to take the New York case — even though the law at issue was recently repealed — has gun rights supporters feeling optimistic that it could lead to a ruling about the right to bear arms outside the home. Gun control advocates, in contrast, fear the court's new conservative majority may produce a decision that the National Rifle Association could use to fight against many of the 300 local gun restrictions enacted since the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012. ‘What's really on the line is our progress against gun violence and the future of life-saving gun safety laws,’ said Hannah Shearer of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.”

-- America’s divided left is losing the battle on abortion. From the Times: “Interviews with more than 50 reproductive rights leaders, clinic directors, political strategists and activists over the past three months reveal a fragmented movement facing longstanding divisions — cultural, financial and political. Many said that abortion rights advocates and leading reproductive rights groups had made several crucial miscalculations that have put them on the defensive. ‘It’s really, really complicated and somewhat controversial where the pro-choice movement lost,’ said Johanna Schoen, a professor at Rutgers University who has studied the history of abortion. National leaders became overly reliant on the protections granted by a Democratic presidency under Mr. Obama and a relatively balanced Supreme Court, critics say, leading to overconfidence that their goals were not seriously threatened. Their expectation that Mr. Trump would lose led them to forgo battles they now wish they had fought harder, like Judge Merrick B. Garland’s failed nomination to the bench. Local activists in states like Alabama, Georgia, North Dakota and Missouri where abortion was under siege say national leaders lost touch with the ways that access to abortion was eroding in Republican strongholds.”

The City Hall of Villa Union is riddled with bullet holes after a gun battle between Mexican security forces and suspected cartel gunmen on Saturday. At least 19 people were killed, four of them police officers when an armed group in a convoy of trucks stormed the town 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex. (Gerardo Sanchez/AP)

MORE ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- At least 19 were killed in northern Mexico after members of a cartel battled with police and the army at a city hall. Mary Beth Sheridan reports: “The assault started at around noon on Saturday, the eve of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s first anniversary in office. Polls show Mexicans regard the failure to curb violence as the greatest weakness of the generally popular leftist leader. … The attack in the town of Villa Union, around 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex., highlighted how the splintering of Mexico’s top cartels has sparked more violence. It was believed to be carried out by the Cartel of the Northeast, an offshoot of the once-powerful Zetas, which is based in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Several groups that spun off from the Gulf and Zetas cartels are fighting with each other in Tamaulipas and nearby states. The attackers swept into Villa Union in at least 14 trucks, some of them armored and bearing the cartel’s logo ... The gunmen unleashed a furious battle at the town hall, peppering the facade with bullets. Terrified residents shut themselves in their homes as the pop-pop-pop of gunfire filled the air ... The attackers fled after about 90 minutes ... Mexican police and soldiers, backed by army helicopters, chased them in an operation that stretched into Sunday morning ... The dead included four state police officers, 13 alleged cartel members and two civilians kidnapped and killed by the attackers, according to Coahuila Gov. Miguel Riquelme.”

The shootout comes days after Trump said he was planning on designating Mexico’s cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, a move Mexico’s government rejected. Attorney General Bill Barr is expected to visit Mexico City this week to discuss Trump’s plan.

-- Authorities in Mexico arrested several people suspected of involvement in the killings of nine members of the LeBaron family, an extended clan of American Mormons living in Sonora. Sheridan reports: “Officials didn’t provide details, and the attorney general’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. The newspaper El Universal cited sources as saying three people were arrested in Bavispe, not far from La Mora. … Julian LeBaron, a family spokesman and longtime anti-violence activist, said the three suspects detained Sunday were low-level ‘thugs.’ He and about 50 other members of his extended family are scheduled to meet with López Obrador on Monday morning. ‘We think that’s the reason why they went and picked up these local thugs — so these people can say, ‘Yeah, we did something about this,’’ he said. He said the family wasn’t satisfied with the arrests of the triggermen, but wanted the detention of ‘the people who were responsible for giving the order’ to carry out the attack.”

-- Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina. Rachel Siegel reports: “‘Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers,’ Trump said in Monday morning tweet. He then directed his attention to the Federal Reserve, saying that the body should ‘act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies. This makes it very hard for our manufactures & farmers to fairly export their goods. Lower Rates & Loosen - Fed!’ … The surprise announcement came after it appeared that the White House was preparing to dial back its adversarial trade approach in the months leading up to next year’s elections. … Earlier in Trump’s presidency, in March 2018, top steel suppliers including Brazil, South Korea and Japan complained that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative had yet to establish a process for countries to apply for tariff exemptions just days before tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum were scheduled to take effect. At the time, Brazil was the No. 2 steel supplier to the United States.”

-- The victims in the London Bridge fatal stabbing attack were recent Cambridge University graduates dedicated to prison reform. Kim Bellware reports: “Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was identified Sunday by London’s Metropolitan Police as the second fatality in the attack. Jack Merritt, a 25-year-old from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, was identified Saturday. Both were involved with Learning Together, a prison-based education program of Cambridge. Merritt was a coordinator and Jones was a volunteer, university officials said. Jones’s family described her as ‘a funny, kind, positive influence’ whose death leaves ‘a huge void.’ … Jones’s family also highlighted her dedication to criminal justice. That passion, they said, had prompted her to apply to a police graduate recruitment program in which she hoped to specialize in victim support. … Merritt, the program coordinator at Cambridge’s Learning Together program, was remembered by his family as a ‘beautiful, talented boy’ who ‘always took the side of the underdog.’ … Merritt’s family urged the public not to use his death as a justification for the kinds of punitive sentencing he fought against.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his rival Jeremy Corbyn traded blame over the early release of London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, a convicted Islamist terrorist who was let go from prison halfway through his 16-year sentence for plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange. William Booth reports: “Khan, who was freed on parole 11 months ago with an electronic tracking device on his ankle, began his attack Friday afternoon as he was entering a conference intended to rehabilitate violent offenders and terrorists. … Johnson, appearing on a BBC political affairs show, said ‘the reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release, which was brought in by a lefty government.’ He was referring to the government of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, which ended in 2010. … Johnson refused to concede any responsibility. Whatever the Tories failed to do in the past, his government will fix it if he wins a majority in the Dec. 12 elections, he said. … Corbyn, Johnson’s principal opponent in the elections, called the government’s early release of Khan ‘a complete disaster’ and called for a ‘very full investigation.’ In a speech in York on Sunday, Corbyn took aim at the cuts to police forces since the Conservatives came into power — a deficit of some 20,000 officers compared to years before.”

-- Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said he will step down next month, after an investigation into the 2017 killing of a journalist raised questions about the role of his former chief of staff and ensnared other members of his inner circle. Chico Harlan reports: “‘This is what the country needs at the moment,’ Muscat said in a nationally televised address. He said he would resign as leader of his own party on Jan. 12 and step down as prime minister of the Mediterranean island nation of half a million people in ‘the days after.’ The decision was the largest political convulsion yet in the investigation into the car bomb death of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a widely read investigative journalist who focused on the corruption of Maltese politicians and other power brokers.”

-- Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the U.S. must avoid a “hot war.” From CNN: “Back in 1989, the United States and the Soviets were on opposite sides of the conflict, with Washington supporting mujahideen fighters trying to topple the government of Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime. But just over two years later, the USSR collapsed, assistance to the Kabul government dried up and Najibullah's government fell. Asked what lessons could be drawn from the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Gorbachev said: ‘They must be withdrawn. That is the main lesson. You know, it's like a match. The match is lit, a fire spreads. And these clashes, when the leading, largest countries in this conflict become ever more involved, they are dangerous for all nations.’

""The fall of the Berlin Wall was preceded by another pivotal moment: The signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987. That pillar of arms control effectively fell apart this year, after the United States formally withdrew and the Russian government said it had been consigned to the trash can. Asked about the demise of the treaty that he signed alongside Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev expressed a hope that such arms control agreements could be revived. … The ultimate goal of arms control, he added, must be to get rid of nuclear weapons completely. That, however, seems a more remote possibility, given the enduring mistrust between Moscow and Washington. US-Russian relations are now at their worst since the Cold War, but Gorbachev expressed hope that it would be possible for Washington and Moscow to find a way to prevent a ‘hot war’ in the future.”

-- A U.S. drone strike killed civilians, Afghan officials claimed. From the Times: “An American drone strike on a car carrying a woman who had just given birth in southeastern Afghanistan left five people dead, including the mother, three of her relatives and the driver, Afghan officials and family members said on Sunday. The strike in the Alisher District of Khost Province occurred either late Friday night or early Saturday, they said. The woman, Malana, 25, had given birth to a son, her second child, at home. But her health had deteriorated soon after and relatives had been taking her to a clinic. On their way home, their vehicle was hit. After the strike, there was confusion about whether the newborn was among the victims. Later, it became clear that the baby had not been in the car. Turab Khan, a relative, said the boy was safe at home.”

-- Gunmen in Burkina Faso massacred 14 Christians during a church service. Danielle Paquette reports: “Sunday’s massacre follows a string of attacks by radical Islamist insurgents on military posts, a mining convoy and places of worship in the restive countryside that the cash-strapped military has struggled to contain. The assailants fled on motorbikes after spraying bullets into the Protestant congregation, authorities said. … No group has asserted responsibility for the attack yet, but fighters linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda routinely ambush soldiers and civilians in a campaign to sow division, gain recruits and seize territory. … The church ambush in Hantoukoura follows attacks on places of worship that have killed dozens this year in the country’s borderlands. … The gunfire is often indiscriminate, analysts say, but extremists have targeted men for wearing crosses and Muslim leaders who do not follow their rules.”

-- Political leaders and diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks, starting today, for talks on climate change. From the BBC: The meeting “was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. … This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but [Trump] will not be among them. However, [Nancy Pelosi] will attend the conference with a congressional delegation.""

What’s more, the first and third have readily obvious responses. The role of the whistleblower was, by that point, established, the person’s initially reported concerns broadly validated by later testimony. The hiring of Hunter Biden by the Ukrainian energy company Burisma can itself be easily explained: It probably sought influence with the administration of President Barack Obama, though there has been no evidence that his position influenced administration policy.

AD

AD

That second question, more than the other two, has emerged as a central point of focus among defenders of Trump. Over the weekend, Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), for example, reiterated his previous claims that there was something to assertions that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. In doing so, he joined Nunes and many others in suggesting, first, that this happened and, second, this is exculpatory for Trump’s behavior.

Given the primacy of this question about what Ukraine did, it’s worth outlining the evidence that Republicans have pointed to during the impeachment hearings and on social media as constituting Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

Those allegations center on a January 2017 Politico article by reporters Ken Vogel and David Stern titled “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.” The prior month, with questions about Russia’s efforts to interfere in the election swirling, Vogel and Julia Ioffe had documented allegations made by Russia about Ukrainian officials trying to hurt Trump’s campaign by targeting Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman. Manafort resigned his position in August 2016 after Ukrainian anti-corruption activists and a member of Ukraine’s parliament named Serhiy Leshchenko alleged that Manafort had received millions in under-the-table payments for his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

AD

AD

The efforts that backfired were threefold, according to Vogel and Stern. One involved those allegations about Manafort that led to his firing. Another were several anti-Trump posts on social media from Ukrainian officials. The third was an effort by a Democratic National Committee contractor named Alexandra Chalupa, whose parents were immigrants from Ukraine, to dig up information about Manafort’s work.

The DNC operative. Chalupa was mentioned frequently by Nunes during the impeachment hearings and was identified by Republicans as a witness they would have liked to have interviewed. She told Politico that she had been focused on Manafort before his hiring by Trump’s campaign and that she had spoken with Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, and some embassy staffers about her concerns shortly before Manafort joined Trump’s team. She denied any formal investigatory relationship with the embassy but said, “If I asked a question, they would provide guidance, or if there was someone I needed to follow up with,” though “there were no documents given, nothing like that.” Chalupa and the DNC noted that her role with the party didn’t include this effort; she left her role with the party after the July convention to focus on the research effort.

Before one hearing, Nunes represented Chalupa's interactions in a decidedly pointed manner.

AD

AD

“Alexandra Chalupa is a former operative for the Democratic National Committee who worked with officials of the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., in order to smear the Trump campaign in 2016,” he said, conflating a focus on Manafort with an effort to “smear the Trump campaign.”

In the next sentence, he looped her into another aspect of the purported “interference.”

The opinion piece. “She met directly about these matters with then-Ukrainian Ambassador Chaly,” Nunes continued, “who himself wrote an article criticizing Trump during the 2016 campaign.”

That article was published by The Hill on Aug. 4, 2016. It focused on comments made by Trump in the days prior in which he suggested he might recognize Crimea — seized from Ukraine by Russia in 2014 — as part of Russia. (“The people of Crimea,” he said in an interview, “from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.”) Chaly’s essay focused on how that willingness to accede to Russia was at odds with existing policy and the platform of the Republican Party.

AD

AD

Several impeachment witnesses were asked about Chaly's essay. Fiona Hill, a former member of Trump's National Security Council, dismissed the Trump criticism as a “peg,” a way of linking an argument defending Ukraine to something that was in the news.

“I would say that it’s probably not the most advisable thing to do for an ambassador because you never know who is going to win,” Hill said — after being asked whether it constituted “election interference.”

The Manafort dirt. In the end, it wasn’t Chalupa’s efforts that doomed Manafort but, instead, the documents presented by Leshchenko. The New York Times had previously reported that Manafort had received more than $12 million in illicit payments from the pro-Russian party for which he worked, but Manafort’s ouster came only after the actual documents were made public by Leshchenko.

AD

AD

Leshchenko told the Financial Times shortly afterward that he believed it was important to “show not only the corruption aspect, but that [Trump] is [a] pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world.” Leshchenko also said that most politicians in Ukraine were “on Hillary Clinton’s side” — both quotes that were included in the Vogel-Stern article. They also spoke with Leshchenko, who told them (in January 2016) that he “didn’t care who won the U.S. elections.” (In an opinion essay for The Washington Post, Leshchenko also denied a political motivation.)

“I think that what Mr. Leshchenko and others who were looking into the black ledger were most concerned about was actually not Mr. Manafort,” Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said during her public testimony, “but former president [Viktor] Yanukovych and his political party and the amount of money that they allegedly stole and where it went and so forth.” The “black ledger” is a commonly used term for the released documents.

Aiding the Republican argument was a December 2018 Ukrainian court ruling that determined that Leshchenko and his colleagues had, by releasing the documents detailing the Manafort payments, been involved “in meddling in the electoral process of the United States in 2016.” In July, that determination was thrown out on appeal.

AD

AD

The disparagement. In addition to Chaly’s essay, in which he pegged a defense of Ukraine to Trump’s comments about Crimea, the Vogel-Stern article noted specific anti-Trump comments by other Ukrainian officials. A former prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, said on Facebook that Trump “challenged the very values of the free world.” Arsen Avakov, the minister of internal affairs, called Trump a “bigger danger to the U.S. than terrorism” and said his comments on Crimea were the “diagnosis of a dangerous misfit.”

Yovanovitch waved away questions about Avakov. When the Republican counsel noted that he had said “some real nasty things” about Trump, she replied that “sometimes that happens on social media” — a reference to Trump’s attacks on her that morning.

“You know, are you asking me whether it’s appropriate? Probably not,” she added. “But I would say that Minister Avakov has been, as well as others, both in President [Petro] Poroshenko’s administration as well as in the Zelensky administration, has been a good partner to the United States.”

AD

AD

“I would just say that those elements that you’ve recited don’t seem to me to be the Ukrainian — you know, kind of a plan or a plot of the Ukrainian government to work against President Trump or, or anyone else,” she added.

Hill was asked about the officials' comments in her closed-door deposition.

“We found disparaging remarks made by pretty much every world leader and official at different points about the President,” she testified, according to a transcript. “So, you know, this is not surprising but, again you know, and the fact of this was in the course presumably of the campaign.”

In the public hearing, she went further, noting that officials even from allied governments had said “some pretty hurtful things” about Trump — and that she would also have taken offense at them.

AD

“The difference here, however, is that hasn’t had any major impact on his feelings towards those countries,” Hill pointed out. “Not that I have seen. But I’ve heard the president say, and he said it in public so I’m not revealing any kind of executive privilege here, that Ukraine tried to take me down.

AD

“I could list a whole host of ambassadors from allied countries who tweeted out, who had public comments about the president, as well,” she added. “And it did not affect security assistance having meetings with them. If it would [there’d be] a lot of people he wouldn’t have met with.”

Beyond the incidents above, all documented in the Vogel-Stern article, no other alleged “interference” has been documented. Articles pointing back to those same events have been compiled to imply a broader effort, as demonstrated by a social media account associated with Trump's reelection campaign.

Ukraine's interference in the 2016 election against Donald Trump was well documented in multiple mainstream news reports. pic.twitter.com/W47pRG7hrv — Trump War Room (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TrumpWarRoom) November 21, 2019

Five of the six headlines shown in the above tweet all point to incidents outlined by Vogel and Stern (and include the Vogel-Stern article itself). The exception is the one about “Moscow’s cyber warriors,” which is obviously a report on Russian interference itself that happened to be staged in Ukraine.

It’s important to compare the Ukrainian “interference” outlined by Vogel and Stern with what’s known about Russian interference. As documented by investigators working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a team of a dozen Russian intelligence officers, working directly on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had carried out hacks targeting Trump’s 2016 opponents. Enormous amounts of material were stolen from the DNC and Clinton’s campaign chairman and released publicly through WikiLeaks. Separately, a group funded by a Russian oligarch tied to Putin was working to heighten political divisiveness on social media and support Trump’s candidacy. Mueller’s team obtained an indictment against another dozen individuals as part of that effort.

As the 2017 Politico article notes, the piecemeal efforts by Ukrainian individuals to potentially influence the 2016 election “were far less concerted or centrally directed” than what the Russian government explicitly engaged in. It’s important to note: Vogel and Stern were writing well before Mueller was appointed or any specific details of the Russian interference effort were documented by federal investigators.

There’s one additional caveat that’s important to mention. In his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump at no point raises specific concerns about a purported effort by Ukraine to interfere in 2016. Trump didn’t express the frustration Hill said she would have found understandable about being disparaged. Instead, he requested an investigation into a specific sub-conspiracy theory about the DNC hacking that has already been robustly debunked.

In other words, the briefest response to Nunes’s second question isn’t the articulation above. It’s to note that what Nunes insists on knowing about isn’t even what Trump was interested in."

Goldman Sachs is popping up in some unexpected places — namely, the 2020 presidential campaign trail.

The Wall Street giant is seeking a rebrand by hosting forums for the candidates focused on small-business issues, as I wrote over the weekend.

The bank, through its “10,000 Small Businesses” program, has underwritten six of the events so far in Iowa and New Hampshire — including with former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

But not everybody’s showing up: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) both are declining to participate. “This is exactly what Sen. Sanders means when he talks about a corrupt political system,” spokesman Mike Casca said via email.

Goldman execs say the initiative is aimed at elevating small business issues in a presidential contest that has so far given them short shrift.

From the story:

Goldman Sachs’s executive vice president, John F.W. Rogers, chair of the firm’s foundation, which underwrites both the 10,000 Small Businesses program and the forums, said the events are “about putting this on the agenda of the candidates. I haven’t seen anybody say, ‘Here’s my plan for small business in America. Here’s how I’m going to address the regulations they face, the need for capital.’” “There seems to be a frustration that nobody thinks about the issues that challenge them,” Rogers said. “I hope some of these businesses will grow one day to become big enterprises and do business with Goldman Sachs,” but the firm has no direct economic stake in the program.

But the firm is also using the events to deepen its ties to the candidates, sending lobbyists from its Washington office to greet them. For the Harris event — which I attended in Ankeny, Iowa outside Des Moines — it was Joyce Brayboy, onetime chief to staff to former congressman Mel Watt (D-N.C.) who has worked for Goldman for more than a decade.

“This is the tip of the spear of Goldman’s whole strategy to reintroduce itself to America as a retail bank that cares about Main Street, rather than a global bank that was engaged in decades of illegal conduct that had devastating consequences for families across the country,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which advocates tougher regulation of the financial services industry. “This is one of the biggest banks in the world staging candidate forums not just as brand enhancement but also to put on their best face with the next president, who will be picking their regulators.”

The firm launched the “10,000 Small Businesses” program nearly a decade ago with the goal of putting that many entrepreneurs through an accelerated training in how to improve and grow their businesses. Some 9,100 have graduated, as the program grew from a pilot project at LaGuardia Community College in Queens to 19 locations, including three state-wide programs, and a national cohort. The firm decided to stage the presidential forums after it held a summit in early 2018 for graduates of the program, and 2,000 of them showed up.

Veteran Iowa political journalist David Yepsen, who moderates the forums in the Hawkeye State, said Goldman has no input into his questions. And financial regulation hasn’t come up. But the firm’s involvement is impossible to miss. More from the story:

The event was introduced by Des Moines Area Community College president Ron Denson, who touted the small-business program’s record helping its graduates expand their operations. Then the crowd heard from Elizabeth Hoppe, a coffee shop owner from Emmetsburg, Iowa, who credited her participation with enabling her to open a second location. She also thanked the bank for its “investment in small business and for providing these opportunities to discuss issues that impact our community.” On the same stage, in July, Booker name-checked Goldman’s small-business effort as a model that should be expanded. “That shouldn’t be the exception; that should be the rule,” he said, “because we know the majority of our jobs that are being created in America are jobs being created by small businesses.”

— U.S. hold on services economy slips. WSJ's Paul Kiernan: ""Over the past half-century, the U.S. has evolved from an industrial superpower into the undisputed champion of the global services economy. From 2003 to 2015, the U.S. trade surplus in services such as medical care, higher education, royalties and payments processing nearly sextupled to $263.3 billion. Growth has since stalled, however. Exports of services barely rose in the first nine months of 2019, while imports increased 5.5%. The services surplus, at $178.5 billion through September, was down 10% from the same period last year, on pace for its steepest annual decline since 2003.

""Some of the softness in service exports likely reflects cyclical factors, such as a strong dollar or slowing foreign economies. But economists say the decline in the surplus is difficult to pin exclusively on such issues. They point to other forces—some political, others more tectonic—that are weighing on exports while prompting American consumers and firms to buy more foreign services.""

— China wants tariff rollback: “Beijing’s top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China’s Global Times newspaper reported on Sunday, amid uncertainty on whether the two sides can end a 17-month trade war that has depressed global growth,” Reuters reports.

“Global Times, published by the official People’s Daily newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also cited another unidentified source close to the talks as saying U.S. officials had been resisting such a demand because the tariffs were their only weapon in the trade war and giving up that weapon meant ‘surrender.’”

The tariff was part of a package of levies designed to retaliate against the European Union for giving subsidies to plane-maker Airbus SE.”

— Cable execs not worried about 5G: “For about the last two decades, the cable industry has been fueled by three revenue streams: cable television, landline phones and high-speed broadband. … Recently, though, cable’s prized triple play has started to erode,” CNBC’s Alex Sherman reports.

“Investors don’t appear concerned. Cable internet has high profit margins and growth has been so strong that the two largest U.S. cable companies, Comcast and Charter, are both trading near record highs even as their business is fragmenting. Comcast added 379,000 residential high-speed broadband customers last quarter, its strongest third quarter in a decade. … While 5G is generating a ton of buzz for its ability to supposedly handle the massive amounts of data coming from artificial intelligence workloads and self-driving cars, the technology has limitations when it comes to replacing cable infrastructure.”

“Lynch, once hailed as Britain’s answer to Bill Gates, is currently battling the American IT giant in London’s High Court.

The discord could be the prelude to a major fissure within federal law enforcement on the controversial question of investigating a presidential campaign.

Barr has not been swayed by Horowitz’s rationale for concluding that the FBI had sufficient basis to open an investigation on July 31, 2016, these people said.

AD

AD

Barr’s public defenses of President Trump, including his assertion that intelligence agents spied on the Trump campaign, have led Democrats to accuse him of acting like the president’s personal attorney and eroding the independence of the Justice Department. But Trump and his Republican allies have cheered Barr’s skepticism of the Russia investigation.

It’s not yet clear how Barr plans to make his objection to Horowitz’s conclusion known. The inspector general report, currently in draft form, is being finalized after input from various witnesses and offices that were scrutinized by the inspector general. Barr or a senior Justice Department official could submit a formal letter as part of that process, which would then be included in the final report. It is standard practice for every inspector general report to include a written response from the department. Barr could forgo a written rebuttal on that specific point and just publicly state his concerns.

Spokespeople for the inspector general and the FBI declined to comment.

AD

AD

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement that the inspector general investigation “is a credit to the Department of Justice. His excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves. Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the Inspector General’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters.”

The Russia investigation was opened after the FBI was told of statements made by a then Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, that the Russians possessed hacked Hillary Clinton emails. Papadopoulos’s alleged comments were key because they were made well before any public allegation that Russian intelligence operatives had hacked the Democratic National Committee.

The attorney general has privately contended that Horowitz does not have enough information to reach the conclusion the FBI had enough details in hand at the time to justify opening such a probe. He argues that other U.S. agencies, such as the CIA, may hold significant information that could alter Horo­witz’s conclusion on that point, according to the people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

AD

AD

Barr has also praised the inspector general’s overall work on the matter, according to one person familiar with the matter. The inspector general operates independently of Justice Department leadership, so Barr cannot order Horowitz to change his findings.

But the prospect of the nation’s top law enforcement official suggesting the FBI may have wrongly opened an investigation into a presidential campaign, even after the inspector general announces the agency was justified in doing so, will probably generate more partisan battles over how the Justice Department and the FBI operate.

It is not unusual for an attorney general or the Justice Department to disagree with some of an inspector general’s findings. However, typically those disagreements occur because senior leaders at the department believe the inspector general has been too critical. In this case, Barr has conveyed to others his belief that Horowitz has not been critical enough, or is at least reaching a conclusion prematurely.

AD

AD

People familiar with the draft language of Horowitz’s report said that while it is critical of some FBI employees, and found some systemic problems in surveillance procedures, it overall does not agree with Trump’s charge that the investigation was a “witch hunt” or a politically motivated attack on him first as a candidate and then as president.

Instead, the draft report found that the investigation was opened on a solid legal and factual footing, these people said.

Part of Barr’s reluctance to accept that finding is related to another investigation, one being conducted by the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, John Durham, into how intelligence agencies pursued allegations of Russian election tampering in 2016. Barr has traveled abroad to personally ask foreign officials to assist Durham in that work. Even as the inspector general’s review is ending, Durham’s investigation continues.

AD

AD

Barr’s disagreement with Horowitz will probably spark further criticism from Democrats, who have already accused Barr of using his position to protect the president and undermine federal law enforcement.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) charged in September that Barr had “gone rogue.”

In recent weeks, Democrats have charged that Barr’s Justice Department was too quick to decide not to investigate Trump over his efforts to persuade Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to announce an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The Ukraine controversy has led to an impeachment inquiry.

Criticism of Barr previously centered on his handling of the Russia investigation. The case that began in 2016 was taken over in May 2017 by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. After a nearly two-year investigation, Mueller filed a lengthy report of his findings to Barr, by which point he had charged 34 people with crimes, including 26 Russian nationals. Those charged and convicted included Trump’s former campaign chairman, former personal attorney, former deputy campaign chairman and former national security adviser.

AD

AD

After receiving the Mueller report, Barr released a short letter summing up its main points, including that there was insufficient evidence to accuse any Trump associates of conspiring with the Russians. Barr also said Mueller had made no determination about whether Trump had sought to obstruct the investigation, but Barr and his then deputy concluded he had not.

When the full report was released, Democrats protested that Barr had improperly skewed the findings to be more favorable to Trump.

Barr has dismissed such criticism, and charged it is Democrats who are abusing legal procedures and standards in their quest to drive Trump out of the White House.

AD

“In waging a scorched-earth, no-holds-barred war against this administration, it is the left that is engaged in shredding norms and undermining the rule of law,” Barr said in a speech last month.

AD

In his first months on the job this year, Barr made clear he had serious concerns about how the FBI had conducted the investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

The attorney general declared in April that the Trump campaign was spied on, though aides later said he used that term not in a pejorative sense but in the more general meaning of surveillance.

“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told lawmakers. “I think spying did occur, but the question is whether it was adequately predicated and I’m not suggesting it wasn’t adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.” He also criticized former leaders of the FBI, saying, “I think there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there in the upper echelon.”

AD

Current and former law enforcement officials have said that, when presented with information about a possible plot to undermine the U.S. election, they had a duty to investigate, and that it would have been wrong not to have launched an investigation.

AD

In the months since, Barr, through Durham, has pursued information related to a onetime associate of Papadopoulos, a European academic named Joseph Mifsud.

Mifsud was publicly linked to Russian interference efforts in late 2017, when Mueller revealed Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the details of his interactions with Mifsud.

Shortly after his name surfaced publicly, Mifsud told Italian media he did not work for Russia. “I never got any money from the Russians: my conscience is clear,” Mifsud told La Repubblica. “I am not a secret agent.”"

“I think that’s insulting to a lot of different forces,” said Trump. “It’s very disrespectful.” But the president himself has questioned whether the alliance has become “obsolete,” and he accused NATO members anew of shirking national commitments on military spending.

AD

AD

Hours later, Macron and Trump sat side by side for a media session, and Macron said he stood by his comments about the health of the NATO alliance. He also firmly expressed his frustration that Trump withdrew hundreds of American troops from Syria in October

The U.S. president bantered with reporters for more than two hours Tuesday, sitting casually in a salon of Winfield House, the manicured estate of the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, where he also met with fellow NATO leaders.

He slammed the ongoing Democratic-led impeachment inquiry back in the United States as a “”hoax” and professed to be unconcerned about declines in the stock market spurred by his remark that a trade deal with China might not materialize until after the 2020 election.

AD

Trump later called on Prince Charles and his wife Camilla and attended a NATO welcome reception at Buckingham Palace, before proceeding to an event at the prime minister’s residence at Number 10 Downing Street. Trump punctuated the day of diplomacy with a fundraiser for his reelection effort that his campaign said brought in $3 million.

AD

The gathering of NATO leaders follows Trump’s frequent criticism of alliance members as falling well short in doing their financial part through the first three years of his presidency.

After a NATO summit last year, he called for members devote at least 4% of gross domestic product to military spending and took aim at German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he accused of paying Russia ‘”billions of dollars for gas and energy” while failing to meet her nation’s commitment to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense.

AD

But at this NATO meeting, Trump — who heads toward an election year looking to showcase foreign policy wins — is offering a more optimistic outlook for the alliance’s future. To that end, he suggested he deserved much of the credit for progress.

“I don’t think frankly before us that NATO was changing at all, and NATO is really changing right now,” Trump said as he sat down for a one-on-one talk with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.

AD

White House officials say that before Trump took office just four NATO members had reached the 2% benchmark set in 2014. Now there are nine, Eighteen of the 29 are projected to meet it by 2024.

Stoltenberg said that Trump does deserve credit for nudging members.

AD

“The reality is that, not least because it has been so clearly conveyed from President Trump that we need fair burden sharing, allies are stepping up,” Stoltenberg said.

In his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump gently ribbed the premier — whose country is spending about 1.3% of GDP on defense — as “slightly delinquent.”

“Some are major delinquent,” said Trump. He added that he’s looking at the possibility of imposing unspecified trade penalties against NATO allies that perpetually fall below benchmarks.

“Some are way below 1 percent and that’s unacceptable, and then if something happens we’re supposed to protect them and it’s not really fair and it never has been fair,” he said.

AD

AD

Trump’s talks with Macron were tense at times.

Before meeting with him on the sidelines of the summit, Trump laced into the French president for what he called “very, very nasty” comments in The Economist about NATO’s health with Trump leading its most important member.

Macron didn’t back down when they appeared later in the day, and he renewed his own criticism of Trump for withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria.

That decision by Trump, made without consulting France or other NATO allies, gave Turkey, another NATO member, a green light to launch operations against Syrian Kurdish forces who played a key role in the fight to clear a huge swath of Syria of the Islamic State.

AD

Trump and Macron have had an up-and-down relationship in the nearly three years Trump’s been in office.

Macron, who early in Trump’s presidency had looked to cultivate a close relationship, hosted Trump in 2017 for Bastille Day celebrations in Paris. Trump reciprocated by honoring Macron last year with the first state visit of a foreign leader during his time in the White House.

AD

As they answered questions from reporters, the new stress was most apparent as they discussed their concerns over Turkey’s plan to purchase an anti-aircraft missile system from Russia.

Macron said there is a disconnect in allowing Turkey to buy the system from Russia and also be a NATO member. Trump said he is weighing issuing sanctions against Ankara if it moves forward with plans to buy the weapons.

AD

Ahead of the meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would oppose a NATO plan to defend the Baltic region if the alliance does not back Turkey in its fight against Kurdish groups it considers terrorists.

“I’m sorry to say we don’t have the same definition of terrorism around the table,” Macron said in a swipe at Turkey.

Trump showed more deference to Erdogan, saying that Turkey was “very helpful” during the October U.S. commando raid that led to the death IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi near the Syria-Turkey border.

AD

“We flew over areas that were totally controlled by Turkey and Turkish military,” Trump said. “We didn’t tell them what we were doing or where we were going. Turkey could not have been nicer, could not have been more supportive.”

AD

At another point in their extended comments before the news media, Trump and Macron had a curt exchange about the repatriation of Islamic State fighters who are European citizens and were captured in Syria and Iraq in recent years. Trump has pressed unsuccessfully for European nations to accept fighters captured by U.S. forces.

“Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you,” Trump said. “You can take every one you want.”

“Let’s be serious,” Macron responded. “Your number one problem are not the foreign fighters.’’

Trump retorted, “’That’s one of the greatest non-answers I’ve ever heard. And, that’s OK.”

After such exchanges, however, Trump gave Macron, along with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a ride in his armored presidential limo from the queen’s reception at Buckingham Palace to another gathering hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at No. 10 Downing St.

He also plans to raise $800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors, as well as $400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes, among other measures.

Biden “is committed to being transparent with the American people about the smart and effective ways he’d pay for the bold changes he’s proposing,” said Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director.

AD

AD

The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.

The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s.

Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.

AD

Biden also opts not to adopt more-aggressive measures that had been under consideration by some advisers to his campaign, including a new tax on Wall Street transactions.

AD

Similarly, Biden proposes increasing the top income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent, where it was before the 2017 GOP tax law. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.

“[Biden] continues to carve out for himself an agenda that’s in the single-digit trillions rather than the double-digit trillions,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served as an adviser to Biden when he was vice president, who added the plan was still highly progressive. “That’s designed to appeal to the moderate part of the electorate, and so far that’s worked.”

AD

Biden’s plan is also likely to meet resistance from conservatives for dramatically raising taxes on firms through a number of measures — many of which were also pushed by President Barack Obama.

AD

Even though Biden’s proposal is starkly different than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary, it would further set him apart from the approach President Trump has promised to pursue. Trump has called for following up the $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017 with a new round of tax cuts, which advisers want to market as a boost for the middle class.

Biden’s plan would seek to prevent corporations from taking advantage of the tax code in a way that allows them to avoid paying many taxes. It would set a global minimum tax for companies based in the United States to recapture revenue if they book their profits in low-tax jurisdictions such as Bermuda or Ireland.

AD

It would also cap how much firms can claim in deductions, end loopholes for real estate investors in the tax code and impose sanctions on countries that allow illegal corporate tax avoidance. Biden had backed many of these ideas before this week but not in as much detail as the newly released plan.

AD

While more acceptable to Republicans than the ideas of Sanders and Warren, Biden’s plan would still make the United States the most heavily taxed country for firms in the OECD, when state and local taxes are taken into account, said Brian Riedl, a tax expert at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

Biden’s math is made easier by pitching less dramatic federal programs than his opponents. Sanders and Warren have called for more than $20 trillion of new spending on a Medicare-for-all health-care system that would guarantee free coverage to all Americans.

AD

Biden’s health-care plan, which the campaign says will cost less than $1 trillion, would leave 10 million people without insurance and do far less to rein in high deductibles and premiums faced by millions of Americans.

Sanders has pushed a plan to tackle climate change that would cost $16 trillion, calling for $2 trillion alone as part of a “Green New Deal” on funding to weatherize and retrofit homes and businesses. Biden’s climate change and infrastructure proposal would cost about $1.7 trillion in total.

AD

Biden’s tax plan also says it will raise $750 billion for his higher-education plan, which includes debt-free community college. Warren and Sanders have proposed trillions in new education spending, as well as the elimination or vast reduction of student debt.

“Biden continues to plan the least ambitious federal program of the top-tier candidates,” said Robert C. Hockett, a professor at Cornell University who has provided policy input for Warren and Sanders. “It’s kind of a drop in the bucket given the long-term problems in the economy. It’s small potatoes for a federal plan.”

Kamala Harris should have been a contender. In the summer of 2017, the California senator was the toast of the Hamptons and new queen of the Clintonites. From the earliest days of her candidacy, Harris boasted the enthusiastic support of Hillary’s donor network and supporters, warm relations with Obamaworld, and the sympathies of a broad range of Democratic lawmakers in the nation’s largest state and beyond. When Harris withdrew from the race Tuesday, she was second only to Joe Biden in FiveThirtyEight’s “endorsement primary.”

If America’s political parties were still strong enough to anoint their own standard-bearers in smoke-filled rooms (and/or wine-soaked patios), Harris would be on her way to a presidential nomination. Instead, she’s cutting her losses and fortifying her defenses against a hypothetical primary challenge in 2022.

The Democratic Establishment may finally be reconciling itself to Joe Biden. But the former vice-president had to maintain a large lead over the field for months before his party’s donors began moving sharply his way. And even now, significant factions refuse to accept that a 77-year-old white guy who’s rambly beyond his years is their best bet for fending off the Democratic left (thus, we all now know the name of the mayor of South Bend). One reason why Barack Obama tapped Biden as his running mate in the first place was that he was looking for a wingman, not an heir apparent — and the idea of Uncle Joe running for the presidency at age 74 appeared self-evidently absurd. The party’s Pooh-Bahs may settle for an even older Biden, but only if the rank and file leaves them no other choice.

Harris was the one they wanted. She offered oratorical talent, a national political identity still inchoate enough to be remodeled to the demands of the moment, and an opportunity to make history. She appeared progressive enough to appease the left, and pragmatic enough to ease the corporate wing’s economic anxieties. But none of that mattered much, in the end.

Multiple suspects are implicated in Kamala 2020’s premature death. The autopsies began while its heart was still beating: Over the weekend, the New York Times curated the mutual recriminations of her campaign’s warring factions. Whoever was truly at fault, there appears to be little disagreement that her operation was poorly managed. But the Harris team’s idiosyncratic failings can’t explain why Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and other conventionally qualified Democratic candidates have been polling behind her. A separate explanation for Harris’s woes is that, in the Trump era, Democratic voters have developed a more conservative conception of electability than the party’s elites. After the trauma of 2016, perhaps many primary goers feel that nominating an African-American or a woman — let alone an African-American woman — would be tempting fate. But while there is almost certainly some truth to this assessment, it also cannot explain why the two candidates who most violently defy the conventional wisdom about “electability” — the Jewish socialist Bernie Sanders, and female anti-corporate crusader Elizabeth Warren — remain poised to compete in Iowa and beyond.

Thus, Harris’s improbable collapse, along with the failure of Booker or Klobuchar to ever launch, seems indicative of something larger than their individual liabilities — namely, the weakness of modern American political parties as institutions. Booker has won more coveted endorsements than Bernie Sanders, and Klobuchar has claimed more than Pete Buttigieg. But each has mustered only a small fraction of the socialist senator’s or South Bend mayor’s support. Harris’s fundamental problem was that her campaign was rich in a depreciating currency. What looked like the potency of Establishment signaling in 2016 may have actually been the power of mere familiarity: Democratic base voters tend to admire the party’s most prominent leaders, and many are happy to default to a familiar face. For this reason, Biden has managed to coast on name recognition and goodwill. But Establishment support without national renown doesn’t seem to count for much.

In the land of weak parties, mass media is king. Politics Twitter may be wildly unrepresentative of the Democratic electorate. And Harris’s campaign may have erred by failing to appreciate that fact. But her candidacy’s demise reveals that catering to the tastes of the Twitter left is nevertheless perfectly rational. Those bundlers in the Hamptons failed to provide Harris with a steady supply of campaign cash. Sanders’s and Warren’s ideologically motivated, extremely online small-dollar armies by contrast have kept their coffers full. Meanwhile, Buttigieg got off the ground by accepting — and “acing” — absolutely every earned media opportunity that came his way. And in the past week, Michael Bloomberg managed to buy himself the same level of national support as Harris by dropping a recording-breaking $30 million on television ads. In many respects, Donald Trump’s 2016 triumph may prove sui generis. But in demonstrating that media dominance can compensate for a total dearth of intraparty support, the mogul’s first campaign gave us a preview of the new normal.

All of which is to say, the main lesson of Harris’s failure may be this: If you enter a presidential race without celebrity status, unique credibility among your party’s most engaged and ideological activists, billions of dollars in personal wealth, or a preternatural gift for charming white journalists and Iowa grandparents, you are going to have a hard time keeping your campaign funded — no matter how warmly you’re celebrated on Capitol Hill or Martha’s Vineyard."

When Joe Biden turned up in Iowa over the weekend on a tour bus with the words “No Malarkey” splashed across the side, he was sending a message to caucusgoers and his Democratic rivals: No more Mr. Nice Joe.

On Monday the gloves came off, with Biden taking swipes at Pete Buttigieg, his main competition for the moderate vote in Iowa and the beneficiary of a recent surge in support, and Elizabeth Warren, who has dropped in polling but remains strong in the state.

According to Bloomberg News, the former VP invited reporters into the no malarkey zone for an unfiltered question-and-answer session that included Biden accusing Buttigieg of copying his health-care plan, which is centered on creating a public option for anyone who wants it. “He stole it,” Biden said. He also accused reporters of going easy on the South Bend mayor. Biden said that if he had put out a health-care plan that so closely resembled an opponent’s, the press would have “torn my ears off.” He added: “I’d be a plagiarizing no good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.” Biden, of course, has been accused of plagiarism before.

Biden also said Buttigieg “doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderates.” But if Biden’s right about that, it’s hard to imagine why the front-runner would be publicly bashing the 37-year-old Hoosier. Buttigieg has positioned himself as an alternative to Biden for voters who see Warren and Bernie Sanders as too far left, and despite Biden’s protests, moderates in Iowa seem to be buying it.

Biden also hit Warren for a lack of “enthusiasm” in Iowa, Bloomberg News reports:

“You don’t see that with Warren. Stop kidding a kidder. OK, come on, man, give me a break,” Biden said of the Massachusetts senator, who’s drawing large crowds, though she’s fallen from her highs in state and national polls. “Look at the polling everywhere. OK. Tell me. Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself.”

Clearly Biden’s not just done with malarkey. He’s got no time for flimflam, poppycock, or balderdash either."

One of the most ubiquitous reactions to Kamala Harris’s sudden withdrawal from the 2020 presidential contest was this reflection on the remaining candidates who have already qualified for the December debate in Los Angeles:

With Harris dropping out, all 6 of the remaining candidates who have qualified for this month's debate are white. (Biden, Bernie, Warren, Steyer, Buttigieg, Klobuchar). — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) December 3, 2019

Some observers making this factual point (factual at the moment, at least) added a little edge to it:

Harris dropping out leaves the Democrats with an all-white debate stage for December -- Biden, Sanders, Warren, Steyer, Buttigieg, Klobuchar



The Democratic Party has created a process with includes Steyer but excludes Cory Booker.



Congrats! — Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) December 3, 2019

And even this:

Kamala Harris officially ended her campaign today, which means that all of the candidates who currently qualify for the December Democratic debate are white (Sanders, Warren, Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Steyer).



White supremacy is not just a Fox News problem, folks. — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 3, 2019

First of all, it should be noted that there are nine days left before qualifying for the December 19 debate ends, and two nonwhite candidates — Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard — are within a single national qualifying poll of making the stage. So the all-white-debate narrative may well be premature.

Second of all, Cory Booker has been on every debate stage up until now. But his stagnant national and early state polling numbers have not kept up with the gradually increasing but still-low polling thresholds created by the DNC. Like a lot of observers, I don’t completely understand why Booker hasn’t caught on a bit better despite perhaps the most consistently solid debate performances of any candidate. But he hasn’t, so far, and that’s not because the DNC has denied him positive exposure.

And third of all, part of the reason nonwhite candidates have struggled is that nonwhite voters aren’t supporting them all that strongly. The last national poll to offer white/nonwhite cross tabs, a November 21–24 survey from CNN, showed 76 percent of nonwhite voters preferring one of the white candidates who have already qualified for the December debate. One percent of them prefer Booker (Yang does a lot better with five percent). Yes, the preferences of nonwhite voters are constrained by what they believe white voters will accept. But the fact remains that in this and other polls, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are doing significantly better among nonwhite than white voters.

Can the Democratic Party as a whole do more to encourage women and minority candidates to run for office, including the presidency? Sure. But a party organization that has been accused in the past of putting a thumb on the scale for this or that candidate can’t really be blamed for at least trying to defer to popular demand in providing access to the debate stage."

What happens next: Those articles will be voted on, one by one, by the House Judiciary Committee and then the full House.

Kamala Harris has dropped out. Cory Booker hasn’t qualified for December’s debate. Julián Castro missed November’s and is polling between zero and one percent nationally. At various points, all three were considered heirs apparent to the voting bloc that lifted Barack Obama to victory. And all three are strong arguments for why the vaunted “Obama coalition” might’ve been the ex-president’s alone.

Conventional wisdom has long held that re-creating Obama’s path to the White House hinged on building a base out of Northern whites, young people, and energized black and Latino voters. The last debate saw Harris and Booker each cast themselves as the candidate best equipped to accomplish this. “We’ve got to re-create the Obama coalition to win,” Harris said. “[Nobody] on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters,” said Booker. Neither has built a convincing case for themselves. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has consistently led polls of Democratic primary voters, including black and Latino ones, and most maneuvering from his nonwhite challengers has been aimed at undermining his dominance. A senescent white centrist might seem an unlikely inheritor of Obama’s supporters, but Biden is well on his way. “I’m part of that Obama coalition,” the 77-year-old said at the debate. “I have more people supporting me, in the black community, that have announced for me, because they know me. They know who I am.”

Almost every political figure upon whom pols and pundits have bestowed the “next Obama” moniker has traits in common: They’re invariably young, almost always nonwhite (Beto O’Rourke, who earned early plaudits from the ex-president, was a rare exception), and have an inspiring but necessarily vague message aimed at flattering their countrymen’s better angels. They embody the shifting demographics that strategists believe will define the electorate of the future: nonwhite with fluency navigating a multiracial milieu without making its occupants feel at odds. But Trump’s election has altered this calculus. White voters who dabbled in multiracial democracy during the Obama years have proven equally enticed by a white supremacist. In 2020, voters repulsed by Trump are less interested in making history and electing some nebulous candidate for America’s diverse future. They want to beat Trump. And most seem to have decided that a challenger whose case for electability is a superficial resemblance to Obama isn’t their best bet.

This isn’t to say that Harris, Booker, and Castro don’t have qualities that recommend them. Castro in particular has distinguished himself with his thoughtful platform aimed at poor people, undocumented immigrants, and the criminalized and incarcerated; Booker has the Trump era’s signature piece of bipartisan legislation under his belt with the First Step Act; and Harris has shined during adversarial exchanges with Republicans in Senate hearings. But it stands to reason that a person seeking to recapture the so-called Obama coalition should bear more than a passing resemblance to the man himself. And none come close: The ex-president’s mix of charisma, rhetorical skill, political savvy, and intelligence remain unparalleled in today’s Democratic Party, and make him a singular figure in modern politics regardless of racial background. His success was also specific to its time. Much of the American public had soured on George W. Bush’s leadership and warmongering by 2008, and Obama not only represented the most striking contrast, he was one of the few senators in the race who hadn’t voted for the Iraq War. (He was not yet in the Senate at the time, but spoke out against the war beforehand.) This gave him an air of legitimacy with progressive voters that Booker and Harris — with their evangelism for charter schools and work as a prosecutor, respectively — are missing. Both were left with a narrow path to the nomination: Either convince black voters and white moderates that they were surer bets than Biden in the general election, or prove to progressives that their bona fides belied a pragmatism and diverse appeal that made them viable alternatives to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

None of it has worked. Their presumed constituencies have found their preferred candidates elsewhere. Older black voters have gravitated to Biden, with his political longevity and vows to preserve Obama’s legislative legacy, while younger black voters have been drawn to the structural change and revolutionary fervor peddled by Warren and Sanders, respectively. Hampering Booker, Harris, and Castro’s cases further was a lack of clarity regarding why an electorate that just backed Trump would suddenly be enticed by a less-galvanizing echo of his predecessor, the black president whose legacy Trump vowed to negate. Voters in 2020 won’t have suddenly lost their susceptibility to the president’s racist charms. And few on the Democratic side are willing to submit a candidate whose appeal to white people with questionable racial politics is dubious or unproven.

Given the Democratic electorate’s consuming desire to oust Trump, it’s unclear if Obama himself could’ve made it out of the 2020 primary. The eventual president trailed Hillary Clinton among even black voters in 2008 until he proved he could win overwhelmingly white electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire. The prospect of continued Republican governance is threat enough today that risk aversion is at a premium. Many voters — and black voters in particular — agree that it’s no time to roll the dice on an unknown quantity, as Obama would’ve been considered. This is by no means a universal consensus. The success of Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns suggest an appetite for democratic socialism that would upend the status quo. Pete Buttigieg is overperforming as a small-city mayor. Andrew Yang has built a coalition that, while almost negligibly small, has generated consistently higher polling numbers than either Booker or Castro.

But generally speaking, the assumption that nonwhite candidates would be best positioned to rebuild Obama’s coalition by virtue of their shared nonwhiteness and a handful of other superficial parallels hasn’t borne out. Democrats instead have thus far coalesced behind a white septuagenarian who fought against busing, implied that every black candidate before Obama was “unclean,” and had at least one other presidential campaign end ignominiously. They’ve done so largely because Biden is well-known and well-liked, has personal ties to the white Rust Belt voters who helped deliver Trump’s win in 2016, and boasts goodwill among liberal voters generated by his affiliation with Obama, who was extremely popular. Simply put, they think he’s the guy that the widest range of voters can agree on. And if this is the conclusion they’ve drawn a mere three years after Obama exited the White House, it’s worth asking whether his coalition, activated by a candidate with a profile similar to his own, was more fluky confluence of circumstances than replicable political strategy.

This article has been updated to more accurately reflect Obama’s activity around the Iraq War."

With the deadline to qualify days away, four white men and two white women have qualified so far, including former vice president Joe Biden, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, billionaire Tom Steyer, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.). Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are both nonwhite candidates, each need one more good poll to qualify, whereas Booker, who is black, and former housing secretary Julián Castro haven’t hit 4 percent in any of the required polls. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black, entered the race Nov. 14 and also does not have any qualifying polls.

For many critics, the question was how this historically diverse class of candidates has faded to white — at least on the national debate stage — before February’s Iowa caucuses. To Booker, part of the problem is that this cycle’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee’s qualifying rules are “preferencing millionaires and billionaires.” To Castro, the news media’s narrative on “electability” has also played a role — an issue he cited in part for both Harris’s downfall and the difficulties facing nonwhite candidates vying for a spot on the debate stage.

Harris had qualified for the debate but cited a lack of funds as the main reason for her decision to bow out. In recent weeks, several news stories described internal turmoil and tense disagreements among staffers in her campaign.

Castro pointed to stories in the New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, all of which questioned the health of Harris’s presidential bid after losing its early momentum and running into management issues. But in a videotaped interview posted to Twitter on Tuesday night, Castro argued that the media’s treatment of Harris had been “grossly unfair and unfortunate” and that Harris was held “to a different standard, a higher standard.”

Speaking more generally, he added on Twitter later: “The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” he said. “Our party’s diversity is our strength, and it’s a shame that we’re headed for a December debate without a single person of color.”

Castro’s criticism stems from debate within the Democratic Party about which candidate is most equipped to corral support from a multiracial coalition of voters, as President Barack Obama did, while having the best chance at defeating President Trump. As The Post’s Philip Bump reported in a Tuesday analysis, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the most capable of beating Trump, according to a November Post-ABC News poll.

In a fundraising video Tuesday, Castro said he was still a few thousand donors away from meeting the DNC’s donor requirements for qualifying for the debate. The rules also require candidates to score in four approved polls over 4 percent, or two early-state polls over 6 percent, and to have 200,000 unique donors plus a minimum of 800 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins, who also previously worked on former Democratic congressman John Delaney’s presidential campaign, told Fox News that he believed the DNC’s rules “ended up hurting” the campaigns of candidates like Castro, Harris and Booker because campaigns must spend “insane amounts” of money on donor lists to meet the requirement. He worried that not having a person of color onstage would affect turnout, particularly among African American voters.

Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization that advocates for electing women of color, said she worried about whether the candidates on the debate stage would resonate with black female voters. “It’s a sad state of affairs to have six white candidates onstage, many of whom don’t necessarily speak with black women — who are the powerhouse voters,” she told MSNBC on Tuesday.

Like Booker, Castro, in his fundraising video, also criticized wealthier candidates who “basically buy their way onto this debate stage.” In a fundraising email of her own, Warren attacked billionaires Steyer and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, another recent addition to the Democratic race, while lamenting Harris’s departure.

“Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand — two women senators who, together, won more than 11.5 million votes in their last elections — have been forced out of this race, while billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg have been allowed to buy their way in,” Warren wrote. “Running for president shouldn’t be a passion project for bored billionaires.""

But some Republicans mocked Democrats’ concern that the field of candidates on the debate stage may be all white. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) made a quip on Twitter that critics called racist. Linking to a tweet listing the all-white lineup for the debate, Cheney wrote: “You forgot Pocahontas.” Using a favorite Trump nickname, Cheney was referring to Warren, who apologized earlier this year for identifying as Native American during her law career. (A spokesman for Cheney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment in response to the backlash.)

Others pointed out that Harris’s campaign faltered because of other problems, such as her record as a prosecutor. On Tuesday, Harris said she was “still very much in this fight.”

When Trump said he would “miss” her in an apparently facetious tweet, Harris responded: “Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see you at your trial.”

Kamala Harris is out of the Democratic race. But where does she go from here? I talked to staff writers Zak Cheney-Rice and Sarah Jones about the California Senator’s primary-campaign errors and her future path.

Ben: After months of deflating momentum, Kamala Harris dropped out of the presidential race on Tuesday — the highest-profile departure so far. It feels like both we and other media outlets have documented her problems exhaustively in recent weeks, but now that her campaign is officially over, I’ll ask one more time: What do you think was the primary reason that she stalled so badly after her high point at the first debate?

Sarah: If you asked me to describe what Kamala Harris the candidate stood for in a sentence, I honestly don’t think I could do it. Sanders has a clear message; so does Warren. So does Biden, even if that message happens to be nostalgia. But I don’t think Harris was ever as clear about her values or her vision of reform. There seemed to be no center to who she was a candidate. And I think that was obvious to voters.

Zak: I think it was a mix of not having a real reason for running and doing so in an election where Democratic voters needed to be sure she could win. Biden is leading in the polls because a lot of voters think he’s a sure thing, or the closest thing to it. A black woman candidate and relative newcomer with a muddled vision and no compelling case for her own electability is a gamble they weren’t willing to take.

Ben: In the aftermath of her announcement, I’ve seen some reaction like this tweet from Joy Reid: “The reality is that no 2020 candidate is perfect, but the extent to which people — including the media but also would-be voters — punished and refused to even consider Kamala Harris for flaws she frankly shared with other candidates, was telling and depressing.” There is no denying that Harris’s campaign was disorganized and muddled, and that her message didn’t really break through. But did she get an unfair shake on top of that? Or is there not much truth to this talking point?

Sarah: There’s a grain of truth to it. Harris was hardly the only candidate in the race to suffer from muddled messaging. Nor was she the only candidate to means-test her policy proposals to the point of absolute absurdity. It may be true that compared to candidates like Pete Buttigieg, Harris did receive a disproportionately high level of negative coverage. But she also had flaws that did set her apart from the rest of the field. This was not the year for a candidate to run on their record as a prosecutor.

Zak: Yeah, I think both can be true. Harris almost certainly entered the race with less room for error than her white and male counterparts, for some of the reasons I alluded to above and others that Sarah pointed to. I also don’t think she got an especially unfair shake. She ran a bad campaign, couldn’t get her talking points straight, and has a bad record as a prosecutor.

Ben: Harris wasn’t polling particularly well, but do you think her exit from the race might help any one candidate over another? And do you think she might endorse someone, or will she lay low (which could possibly be advantageous if she wants a VP-nominee slot)?

Zak: I don’t see any immediate benefits to her endorsing. If her feelings about who should be the nominee was important enough to voters that it could shape the race at this point, she probably would’ve had a more successful campaign.

Sarah: If her departure helps anyone, it will probably be Pete, but I don’t think she made enough of an impact in the race for her absence to benefit any candidate to a significant degree. And I also doubt she plans on endorsing anyone right now. Not sure what she, or anyone else, would gain from her making an endorsement until the memory of her very badly run campaign fades a bit.

Ben: Do you think the vice-presidency could be in her future?

Sarah: Maybe! It’s really hard to say right now. Again, she polled so badly that I’m not sure what someone would gain from putting her on a ticket.

Zak: I doubt it. I think she’d have been a natural choice for someone like Biden or Warren prior to running her own campaign. But now that she’s run, and run badly, it’s hard to see anyone still in the race concluding that there’s some vital constituency clamoring for her inclusion.

Ben: Is she the (fairly) rare candidate who hurt her reputation by running for president, or will she be just fine in the long run?

Zak: She’ll be fine. A bad race is a bad race. I don’t think anyone came away from this doubting that Harris has charisma and talent and a compelling profile. Her weaknesses are clearer now than before, but she can work on her overarching political vision over the next few years in the Senate and come back with a better campaign staff and make noise.

Sarah: In the long term? Fine, probably, but I do think her record as a prosecutor is a handicap."

A watchdog group, American Oversight, in May asked the State Department for records related to alleged efforts by Trump and his administration to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, events that are the subject of a House impeachment report released Tuesday.

The Trump administration has declined to release records to the House, as part of the White House’s blanket refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. However, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) empowers judges to order the release of documents requested by members of the public, and federal lawsuits to enforce such requests can move much more quickly through the courts than battles over congressional subpoenas.

“The public should expect more disclosures, over the administration’s strong objection, for the foreseeable future,” American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers said earlier in the litigation.

After Tuesday’s hearing, Evers added, “If I were a member of Congress and thinking about voting on articles of impeachment and whether to convict the president, I would keep in mind that the evidence is going to continue trickling out after I cast that vote, and if the trend continues, it’s not going to get better.”

The group sought records since March 2018 related to the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and readouts from a July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for “a favor” while his administration was withholding military aid.

Cooper in late October ordered the State Department to begin releasing Ukraine-related documents. American Oversight filed its lawsuit on Oct. 1. Tuesday’s hearing focused on the group’s request that the court order the department to prioritize the release of records involving Sondland and Volker, any notes of the July 25 call, and records of Pompeo’s other communications, such as a publicly reported September call with Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.

The suit has taken on added urgency as Democratic leaders have signaled they wish to conclude the House inquiry by year’s end.

American Oversight said an initial 98-page disclosure by the department on Nov. 22 documented multiple earlier communications from Giuliani through the White House to Pompeo “to facilitate a smear campaign” against Yovanovitch.

Justice Department trial attorney Joshua C. Abbuhl of the civil division’s federal programs branch argued Tuesday against a court order, saying that allowing FOIA requesters to change the department’s procedures midstream would substantially tax already stretched resources, duplicate workloads and reduce the efficiency of records searches at a time when the department faces a long backlog of requests.

AD

“It is just very difficult to process documents that have already been” screened, Abbuhl said, adding that there is a “substantial likelihood” that Volker and Sondland’s communications could reflect internal department deliberations that would be exempt from public release.

AD

Cooper said he would wait until Monday, when the department has said it will explain exactly how it has searched for responsive documents and over what period, but expressed skepticism at the department’s claim that it had no readouts or summaries of the July 25 call or the secretary’s other communications.

“I’ll wait to see what the department says,” Cooper said, before adding later, “It seems unlikely there would be no summaries or readouts of that call.”

AD

American Oversight attorney Daniel A. McGrath argued that Volker and Sondland are the “key witnesses” in the impeachment inquiry and noted that Sondland himself testified that the State Department blocked him and House lawmakers from accessing his records and communications that could have bolstered his recollection.

McGrath said even if portions are redacted, the two diplomats’ communications in August and September were “likely to be of great public importance,” explaining what the White House and Trump’s personal attorney were doing and how the State Department responded."

Tom Steyer’s presidential campaign wasn’t born on third base. Unlike some other Democratic candidates, the humble hedge-fund manager didn’t enter the 2020 race with national name recognition, his own journalistic empire, or a multibillion-dollar personal fortune. In fact, Steyer’s wealthiest intraparty rival could afford to buy up every last thing he owns more than 30 times over.

And yet, through hard work, determination, and $63 million in television ad buys, this salt-of-the-earth, single-digit billionaire has earned his place on the Democratic debate stage in December, while Michael “Moneybags” Bloomberg has not.

To qualify for Blue America’s next oratorical smackdown in Los Angeles, candidates had to either hit 4 percent in four national polls approved by the DNC, or 6 percent in two early primary-state polls, while also securing campaign contributions from at least 200,000 donors. Steyer had already assembled the necessary polls before this week. And on Tuesday morning, his campaign announced that it had cleared the donor threshold.

Steyer is the seventh candidate to qualify for the December debate stage, where he will join Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. Other candidates have until December 12 to hit their marks.

Bloomberg, for his part, appears poised to outshine Steyer in their vote-buying contest. Last week, the megabillionaire (whose net worth is estimated at $54.6 billion, dwarfing Steyer’s piddling $1.6 billion) launched a $30 million ad blitz, the most expensive single week of campaign advertising in the history of presidential primaries.

Ads work, at least to a point.

In return, Bloomberg saw his support in national polls more than double to over 5 percent. Morning Consult’s tracking poll currently puts Bloomberg in a tie for fifth place with Kamala Harris; Steyer, meanwhile, is in a four-way tie for eighth with 2 percent support. But the former New York mayor has sworn off all campaign contributions, and is thus incapable of qualifying for any of the remaining Democratic debates, barring a change in the rules. And although Steyer is not registering much in national polls, in the early primary states — which he has inundated with paid messaging — Morning Consult has him at 9 percent, just three points behind Elizabeth Warren."

— letter from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Nov. 21, 2019

AD

President Trump has falsely claimed that then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Ukraine’s largest private gas company, Burisma, at a time when Hunter Biden was on the Burisma board. In fact, the opposite is true — Joe Biden was carrying out administration policy, coordinated with European allies, to press for the removal of Shokin because he was not investigating corruption.

These facts have not stopped Trump’s Republican defenders from trying to prove Trump correct. In recent weeks, senior lawmakers have suggested that there was a nefarious connection between a “raid” in February 2016 on the home of the founder of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, and calls that Biden made at the time with Ukraine’s president at the time, Petro Poroshenko.

AD

Graham has made this alleged connection the start of an investigation he has launched into Biden and his son, demanding records and transcripts of Biden’s calls to Ukraine that month.

AD

The Fact Checker was suspicious of these claims because it had been our understanding that the investigation of Zlochevsky was largely dormant at the time of Biden’s diplomacy. Indeed, the U.S. ambassador at the time had singled out mismanagement of the Zlochevsky case as an example of Ukraine’s failing to hold corrupt officials to account.

Working with our colleagues Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern, who discussed the case with sources while reporting in Kyiv, we’ve determined that this alleged connection is based on a misunderstanding of what took place in the Ukrainian courts.

AD

The Facts

Zlochevsky had served in top Ukrainian government positions in the country’s energy sector and had transformed himself into one of the country’s richest men. In the process, he has faced years of legal troubles and allegations of corruption, which he has denied. Britain once froze $23 million of his assets, but he was not charged with any crimes and the freeze was eventually lifted.

AD

Zlochevsky was also under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors. On Aug. 5, 2014, the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) initiated case 42014000000000805 regarding “large-scale” illicit enrichment and money laundering allegedly committed by Zlochevsky, according to a timeline provided to Birnbaum by the Anticorruption Action Center (AntAC), a leading anti-corruption group.

AD

After briefly transferring the case to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, on Dec. 29, 2014, the PGO issued a notification of suspicion to Zlochevsky regarding the allegations. AntAC reports that prospects for success were “low from the very beginning” because the statutes for “illicit enrichment” required a high burden of proof to show that assets were proceeds of bribery. (Ukrainian journalists say that making the case briefly a police matter led to the unfreezing of Zlochevsky’s assets in Britain.)

Nevertheless, on Feb. 2, 2015, the Prosecutor General’s Office seized personal property attributed to Zlochevsky but legally owned by his family, including a mansion, a luxury car and plots of land, according to AntAC. The court order was not published, but journalists eventually exposed what had happened later in 2015.

AD

Now here’s where it gets complicated. On Nov. 10, 2015, the Ukrainian parliament adopted a law amending the procedure for asset seizures, requiring higher standards of proof. The law came into force in December, and Zlochevsky appealed the seizure.

AD

In the meantime, that same month, the PGO tried to send its cases to another prosecutorial entity, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which is funded with U.S. and European aid and received technical support from the FBI. “NABU received tons of files in December 2015, just as their jurisdiction was starting,” said Daria Kaleniuk, the head of AntAC.

(During a December visit to Kyiv, Biden had addressed the Ukrainian parliament and decried the “cancer of corruption” in the country. “The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform,” he said. During that visit, he also privately urged Poroshenko to fire Shokin.)

AD

“There was a window of a few weeks when Zlochevsky’s lawyers sued to unseize the assets,” Kaleniuk told Birnbaum. “The court unseized the assets in December when the case was in between jurisdictions. The prosecutors didn’t even show up,” because they had no jurisdiction, since the case had been transferred from Shokin’s oversight, in the prosecutor general’s office, to NABU.

AD

So, on Dec. 25, 2015, the seizure was canceled. But the court order was not published until Jan. 27, 2016, and it prompted a public outcry, according to AntAC. So the PGO scrambled to get it reinstated, and the order was published Feb. 4, 2016.

When we asked Graham’s office why he thought there was a raid in February 2016, his office pointed us to a news account of the second court order. The article, however, references property “seized under the previous court ruling.”

AD

In other words, there was largely a technical reinstatement of a court order that already had been in place for at least a year. Matching up the assets listed in the July 2015 report and the February 2016 report, the main difference we see is the inclusion in 2016 of a Rolls-Royce and a trainer, though AntAC reports a luxury car was seized in 2015.

AD

Later in 2016, on Nov. 1, the seizure was canceled after the PGO closed the case, according to AntAC. The case over time had been turned into an investigation of possible tax avoidance, and a Burisma subsidiary paid back taxes.

As for Biden’s phone calls, the Obama administration regularly provided detailed readouts of the calls, so the topics are well-documented.

Feb. 11: Biden spoke to Poroshenko by phone. “The two leaders agreed on the importance of unity among Ukrainian political forces to quickly pass reforms in line with the commitments in its IMF program, including measures focused on rooting out corruption,” the White House said.

AD

Feb. 18: Another call took place between Biden and Poroshenko, two days after the president had announced he had asked Shokin to resign. “The Vice President also commended President Poroshenko’s decision to replace Prosecutor General Shokin, which paves the way for needed reform of the prosecutorial service,” the White House said in a statement.

AD

Feb. 19: Poroshenko announced he has received Shokin’s resignation letter. That same day, Biden spoke separately to Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. “He urged Ukraine’s leadership to unite and rebuild popular trust around a strong governing coalition and reform program, and to accelerate Ukraine’s efforts to fight corruption, strengthen justice and the rule of law, and fulfill its IMF requirements,” the White House said.

“I listened in to all the February calls. Until Nunes floated his wacky conspiracy theory, I’d never heard of the ‘raid’ — and nothing related to Burisma or Zlochevsky came up in any of those calls,” Colin H. Kahl, Biden’s national security adviser at the time, told The Fact Checker. “Unlike the current administration, we always read out our calls, and the call readouts captured the major topics of the conversations.”

AD

Anna Makanju, Biden’s senior policy adviser for Ukraine at the time, also listened to the calls and said release of the transcripts would only strengthen Biden’s case that he acted properly. She helped Biden prepare for the conversations and said they operated at a high level, with Biden using language such as Poroshenko’s government being “nation builders for a transformation of Ukraine.”

A reference to a private company such as Burisma would be “too fine a level of granularity” for a call between Biden and the president of another country, Makanju told The Fact Checker. Instead, she said, the conversation focused on reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund, methods to tackle corruption and military assistance. An investigation of “Burisma was just not significant enough” to mention, she said.

Pavlo Klimkin, Ukrainian foreign minister from 2014 until Aug. 29, 2019, told Birnbaum that the firing of Shokin was universally urged by Ukraine’s benefactors. “The demand came not just from the U.S., and not just from Biden,” he said. “I heard it in every meeting with the international financial institutions, especially the IMF and World Bank. It was not just Biden. Clearly.”

We reported our findings to Graham’s aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee and to a spokesman for Nunes on the House Intelligence Committee but did not receive an immediate response. Instead, out of the blue we received a phone call from John Solomon, a former Washington Post reporter who apparently was the source for Republicans. He said two people from Capitol Hill had alerted him to our inquiry.

Solomon acknowledged that there had been a seizure of assets in 2015 but said that on the basis of his interviews, such as with Shokin, and a review of court files, he believes some new assets were seized in February 2016. “My understanding is there was a reseizure and a new seizure of assets,” he said. “There was back and forth [in the courts], sure.”

Solomon added: “I am very careful to use the word ‘seizure.’ I don’t use the word ‘raid.’ ”

“The purpose of our investigation is to find out the truth of what the son of a former vice president of the United States was doing on the board of a Ukrainian gas company who was paying him $50,000 a month,” said Taylor Reidy, spokeswoman for the Senate Judiciary Committee. “He didn’t have any known experience in Ukraine or the oil and gas industry. But the company did appear to be running into legal issues regarding corruption. Our letter was the first step in our investigation, not the last. We expect additional requests for information as we learn more about these interactions and what was happening among the stakeholders.”

The Pinocchio Test

Republicans are clearly trying to connect some dots to give an impression of malfeasance by Biden. But they are looking at the wrong dots. Nothing significant appears to have happened in February 2016 except primarily the reinstatement of a previous court order. Instead, Zlochevsky’s assets had been seized a year earlier and were only briefly not under a court order because of a prosecutorial error.

In other words, there would have been no reason for Biden to raise the supposed raid of Zlochevsky’s home in his phone calls. Moreover, as we’ve shown, Biden’s aides at the time say that neither Burisma nor Zlochevsky was raised in the calls.

The House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry report demonstrates in exhaustive detail that President Trump and numerous aides pressured Ukraine to open investigations for Trump’s political benefit. The report describes this as “a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.”

But the effort almost certainly took place over years, not months. Indeed it grew directly out of the ties developed between Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence during the 2016 campaign.

The Ukraine scandal burst into the view of Congress and the public this summer when the House Intelligence Committee obtained a whistle-blower’s report. The report focused on a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, and Trump’s plot to withhold military aid as leverage. But the fact that this sequence of events was exposed does not mean it is the entirety of the plot. The sequence of events instead suggests that Trump has been extorting Ukraine for his own political gain not only in 2017, but during the previous two years as well.

Begin with Trump’s notion that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked Democratic emails. This is the idea he raises in his call with Zelensky, asking his befuddled Ukrainian counterpart to locate a server that, according to this bizarre conspiracy theory, was handed by Democrats over to Ukrainians and that would prove Russia had been framed. American intelligence officials have described the theory as a Russian-backed disinformation campaign.

Where did Trump get this idea from? He seems to have first heard it in the summer of 2016, from Paul Manafort, his campaign manager. Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, told Robert Mueller that Manafort had been spouting the theory that Ukrainians framed Russia since the summer of 2016, and that the theory seemed to come from Manafort’s partner, Konstantin Kilimnik, who American officials believed was a Russian intelligence operative.

By April 2017, Trump was repeating this theory in public, falsely telling an Associated Press reporter that a “Ukrainian-based” company had taken the Democratic server with the stolen emails. A few months after that, Rudy Giuliani began meeting with Ukrainian officials. Giuliani recently explained that he pursued the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had hacked Democratic emails because it would exonerate Trump. Obviously, Trump could not have colluded with Russia to exploit stolen emails if Russia hadn’t stolen the emails in the first place. “I knew they were hot and heavy on this Russian collusion thing, even though I knew 100 percent that it was false,” he told Glenn Beck. “I said to myself, ‘Hallelujah.’ I’ve got what a defense lawyer always wants: I can go prove someone else committed this crime.”

Giuliani undertook what appear to be two previous episodes of trading diplomatic favors to Ukrainians in return for steps to protect Trump from the Mueller investigation. The first apparent trade involved a meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s then-president Petro Poroshenko in return for a Ukrainian investigation that would exonerate Manafort, then a prime target of Mueller’s.

Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake summarizes the timeline:

June 8, 2017: Trump ally Rudolph W. Giuliani meets with Poroshenko and then-Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko.

June 9, 2017: Lutsenko’s office joins an existing investigation into the “black ledger,” which implicated former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The investigation had previously been handled only by Ukraine’s independent National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), and critics alleged the new move was meant to bury the scandal.

June 14, 2017: Reports in Europe indicate Poroshenko will meet with Trump.

June 19, 2017: Spicer says Poroshenko will meet with Vice President Pence, but doesn’t confirm a meeting with Trump.

June 20, 2017: Poroshenko gets a brief “drop-in” visit with Trump.

This is either a direct trade, or an exchange of mutually-beneficial actions that coincidentally occurred in very rapid succession.

The next apparent quid pro quo took place the next year. The U.S. sold desperately needed Javelin missiles to Ukraine that year, and the New York Times reported at the time that Ukraine suspended cooperation with the Mueller investigation. (This is another one of those Trump-era episodes where a credible report of shocking misconduct immediately sinks without a trace into the vast ooze of other Trumpian outrages.) “In every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,” one Ukrainian lawmaker and close ally of President Poroshenko explained to the Times.

The benefit of this move to Trump was immense. Manafort and Kilimnik were key figures in the Mueller probe. Mueller found that Manafort had slipped Kilimnik 75 pages of polling data during a meeting in the summer of 2016. Here you have proof that Trump’s campaign manager gave valuable, detailed information to a known Russian spy, at a time when the Russians were running a pro-Trump media operation. But Mueller never determined what the polling was for. And Kilimnik was able to leave Ukraine and escape to Russia, where Mueller could not interview him. A State Department document concluded that Lutsenko, who had met with Giuliani, allowed Kilimnik to leave the country.

Neither of these episodes has been investigated in anything like the depth of the 2019 episodes. But both bear all the same superficial hallmarks to what occurred this year. In both instances, Giuliani had contacts with Ukrainian officials, and traded the same things (a presidential meeting and military aid). Also in both cases, Ukraine put its famously corrupt judicial system at the disposal of Trump’s domestic interests.

In 2017 and 2018, Trump was consumed by the Mueller investigation, and seems to have pushed Ukraine to take steps to stymie it. By 2019, Giuliani had taken an interest in claims of wrongdoing by Joe Biden, and added demands for a Biden probe to his push for investigations that would exonerate Russia’s (and therefore Trump’s) behavior in 2016.

By 2019, Trump and Giuliani were barely hiding their actions. Giuliani was boasting about his activities to every reporter who would listen. And Trump was directing a growing array of officials to follow Giuliani’s lead, despite the obvious impropriety of placing American foreign policy in the hands of his private attorney who was openly working on his political behalf.

Why did they flaunt their scheme so widely and carelessly? Most likely because they had already been doing the same thing for two years."

Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), in an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Dec. 1, 2019

Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, defended President Trump’s efforts to urge the Ukrainian president to investigate a potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, as a responsible attempt to investigate corruption overseas. We’ve documented before that administration claims about being concerned about corruption in Ukraine don’t add up, given that the Defense Department had already certified Ukraine as meeting corruption targets to receive the military aid that Trump blocked.

AD

AD

But now we are interested in Collins’s assertion that witnesses in the impeachment inquiry had agreed that Hunter Biden’s association with Ukraine’s largest private gas company, Burisma, should be “looked at.” We had watched the hearings and read the deposition transcripts — and that did not ring a bell. His comment also attracted the attention of other reporters. We were especially taken with Collins’s reference to “a massive amount of money” earned by Hunter Biden — earnings that were news to many witnesses. That sounded a lot like the probes that lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) have said are necessary.

Jessica Andrews, communications director for House Judiciary Committee Republicans, said that Collins was not saying that witnesses said Biden’s contract with Burisma should be investigated, only that they said there was a perception of a conflict of interest.

The Facts

As we’ve noted, one can certainly raise questions about Hunter Biden’s judgment in joining Burisma’s board in 2014, at a time his father had a high-profile role in working with Ukraine’s government. It has certainly sparked damaging headlines.

AD

AD

Trump has falsely claimed that the vice president pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Burisma. In fact, the opposite is true — Biden was carrying out administration policy, coordinated with European allies, to press for the removal of Shokin because he was not investigating corruption. In September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt publicly criticized Shokin’s office for thwarting a British money-laundering probe into Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.

During the impeachment hearings, and in earlier depositions, Republican lawmakers regularly brought up Hunter Biden. But they never received any answers suggesting a need for an investigation into his actions, specifically the money he earned as a board member. The best they received was a vague concern, offered by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, about a “possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.”

Kent had disclosed during his deposition that in early 2015, when he was deputy chief of mission in Kyiv, he had had a phone conversation with a Biden aide and had “raised my concerns” that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the Vice President’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family related issues at that time,” Kent said.

AD

AD

Another witness, former special envoy Kurt Volker, would only offer that it was appropriate for the Ukrainian government to investigate possible misdeeds by Ukrainian citizens; he did not suggest that an investigation of Hunter Biden was necessary.

“I think that there is a problem with perceptions of conflicts of interest and ethics for any child of any senior official to be involved in anything that their parents are involved in, period,” said Fiona Hill, Trump’s former top Russia specialist, in her deposition. “So this goes not just to Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden but across the board.”

We reviewed all of the hearings and relevant depositions. Here are the key exchanges that concerned Hunter Biden.

AD

STEVE CASTOR, MINORITY CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL: OK, so Hunter Biden’s added to the board of Burisma. Now, do you think that creates a problem that Burisma may be adding people to its board for protection purposes?

AD

GEORGE KENT, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EUROPEAN AND EURASIAN AFFAIRS: Sir, I work for the government. I don’t work in the corporate sector, and so I believe that companies build their boards with a variety of reasons, not only to promote their business plans.

...

CASTOR: OK, but you know Hunter Biden's role in Burisma's board of directors. At some point you testified in your deposition that you expressed some concern to the Vice President's Office. Is that correct?

AD

KENT: That is correct.

CASTOR: And what did they do about that concern that you expressed?

KENT: I have no idea. I reported my concern to the Office of the Vice President.

CASTOR: OK. And that was the end of it, nobody...

KENT: Sir, you would have to ask people [who] worked in the Office of the Vice President during 2015.

AD

CASTOR: But after you expressed the concern of a perceived conflict of interest at the least, the vice president's engagement in Ukraine didn't decrease, did it?

KENT: Correct. Because the vice president was promoting U.S. policy objectives in Ukraine.

CASTOR: And Hunter Biden's role on the board of Burisma didn't cease, did it?

KENT: To the best of my knowledge, it didn't. And my concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.

AD

REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-N.Y.): But let’s take a first — a step back. The first time you personally became aware of Burisma was actually when you were being prepared by the Obama State Department for your Senate confirmation hearings. And this was in the form of practiced questions and answers, this was your deposition. And you testified that in this particular practice Q&A with the Obama State Department, it wasn’t just generally about Burisma and corruption, it was specifically about Hunter Biden and Burisma. Is that correct?

MARIE YOVANOVITCH, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Yes, it is.

STEFANIK: And the exact quote from your testimony, Ambassador, is, quote, “The way the question was phrased in this model Q&A was, what can you tell us about Hunter Biden’s, you know, being named to the board of Burisma?” So for the millions of Americans watching, President Obama’s own State Department was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping this wonderful ambassador nominee before her confirmation.

AD

...

REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, (R-TEX.): You understood from Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent’s testimony, as it’s been related to you, that he testified a few days ago, do you understand that that arrangement, Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board, caused him enough concern that, as he testified in his statement, that “in February of 2015, I raised my concern that Hunter Biden’s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest.” He went on to talk about the Vice President’s responsibilities over the Ukraine and — or over Ukraine — Ukrainian policy as one of those factors. Do you recall that?

AD

YOVANOVITCH: Yes.

RATCLIFFE: Do you agree with that?

AD

YOVANOVITCH: Yeah.

RATCLIFFE: That it was a legitimate concern to raise?

YOVANOVITCH: In that it could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest.

CASTOR: And are you aware of any specific experience Hunter Biden has in the Ukrainian corporate governance world?

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN, DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: I don’t know much about Mr. Hunter Biden.

...

STEFANIK: You are aware that Hunter Biden did sit on the board of Burisma at this time?

VINDMAN: I am.

STEFANIK: Well I know — I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of the vice president, sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma. The Obama Administration, State Department was also concerned and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests. Every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered yes. Do you agree that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?

AD

VINDMAN: Certainly the potential, yes.

STEFANIK: And Ms. Williams?

JENNIFER WILLIAMS, SPECIAL ADVISER FOR EUROPE AND RUSSIA, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.

DANIEL GOLDMAN, MAJORITY DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS: You understood the relationship between Hunter Biden and Burisma?

AMBASSADOR KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO UKRAINE: I knew that he had been a board member of the company, yes.

...

CASTOR: Subsequent to those facts and the bribe being paid, the Burisma company wanted to improve their image and added some folks to their board, including the president of Poland, including Hunter Biden. Are you familiar with that?

VOLKER: That's what I understand.

CASTOR: And to the extent the Ukrainians, the folks affiliated with Burisma wanted to hire those people for their board for protection purposes so they could continue to engage in misdeeds, if that was a fact worth investigating, you certainly would be supportive of Ukrainians trying to get to the bottom of that, correct?

VOLKER: Well, I can't speculate as to any of the specifics of what was motivating Burisma or not. Ukrainian government authorities investigating possible corruption by Ukrainian citizens is a perfectly appropriate thing...

CASTOR: OK.

VOLKER: ... for them to do.

STEFANIK: Do you believe that Hunter Biden having a position on the board of Burisma has the potential appearance of a conflict of interest?

AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE EUROPEAN UNION: I don’t want to characterize Hunter Biden’s service on the board one way or another. I just don’t know enough.

STEFANIK: So you disagree with every other witness that has answered yes, there is a potential appearance of a conflict of interest.

SONDLAND: Well, you asked if there was a conflict or an appearance ...

STEFANIK: A potential — my quote was the potential appearance of a conflict of interest.

SONDLAND: I didn’t hear the word appearance. Well, clearly it’s an appearance of a conflict.

...

REP. DENNY HECK (D-WASH): You’ve testified here today that you also came to believe that the request for investigations under Burisma was in fact a request to investigate the Bidens, both former Vice President and Hunter. And indeed, the transcript of the July 25 call makes specific reference to that, including Hunter Biden. And today even the Ranking Member said we could clear all this up if we could have Hunter Biden, and I have a simple question — what Ukrainian law did Hunter Biden violate?

SONDLAND: I'm not aware.

HECK: What evidence is there that he may have violated any Ukrainian law?

SONDLAND: I'm not aware.

“Ranking Member Collins meant what he said: People have testified that the relationship between Hunter Biden and Burisma needed to be looked at. At the very least, Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma deserved consideration,” Andrews, the communications director for House Judiciary Committee Republicans, said. “The ranking member didn’t prescribe the who, what, or when of that consideration. Instead, he took his cue from testimony offered by Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent and Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who agreed that the matter needed to be addressed, specifically by the Office of Vice President Biden. Mr. Kent himself raised his ‘concern that Hunter Biden’s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest’ with the Vice President’s office. Ambassador Yovanovitch agreed with Mr. Kent’s action. They agreed that the issue was concerning enough that it needed to be looked into, and Ranking Member Collins heard that concern.”

The Pinocchio Test

The record shows that no witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have said that Hunter Biden’s involvement in Burisma, specifically the money he earned as a board member, was worthy of investigation. But Collins’s spokeswoman says that he did not say or suggest that — he was only referring to phrases such as a “possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.”

We’re not going to put words in Collins’s mouth and so we will leave this unrated. Readers can draw their own conclusions.

Yesterday, Devin Nunes, the comically litigious congressional Republican who has orchestrated President Trump’s defenses in the Russia and Ukraine scandals, filed another lawsuit — this time against CNN, for reporting Lev Parnas’s allegations that Nunes had met with a Ukrainian oligarch. “CNN was well-aware that Parnas was a renowned liar, a fraudster, a hustler,” charges Nunes. Parnas is so dishonest and disreputable, argues Nunes, that CNN was irresponsible even to publish his allegations.

In a highly inconvenient coincidence of timing, within hours of Nunes’s lawsuit, the House Intelligence Committee published a report on the scandal that included new phone records. These records show that Nunes and Parnas have spoken on the phone several times.

It seems like a weird choice for Nunes to have taken a bunch of calls with a known liar, fraudster, and hustler. Nunes habitually refuses to answer questions from journalists about his activities. Instead he appeared last night on Sean Hannity. “Did you ever talk to this guy Les Parnas, or whatever his name is?” asked the Fox News host. (That Lev Parnas, who met repeatedly with the president and worked closely for months with his lawyer, has now been demoted to “this guy” indicates how much trouble he poses now that he is cooperating with law enforcement.)

“You know it’s possible,” replied Nunes, “but I haven’t gone through all my phone records.” It’s possible? The House Intelligence Committee has gone through the phone records! Nunes is on the records! This isn’t a hypothetical question!

Nunes’s lawsuit does not deny reporting by CNN — or by the Daily Beast, which he also previously threatened to sue — that he worked with Parnas to discredit Joe Biden. Instead it focuses on Parnas’s claim that Nunes met in Vienna with Viktor Shokin, the corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor who has spread pro-Republican conspiracy theories. Nunes denies having met with Shokin, or having traveled to Vienna during the time in question. It shows a series of photographs of Nunes in Malta and Libya.

It is certainly possible that Parnas’s secondhand account of this meeting is false. Unfortunately for Nunes, his lawsuit relies on the theory that CNN was negligent to publish an allegation by Parnas who is a notorious criminal and liar, yet Nunes himself consulted with Parnas on several occasions.

To date, the only defense to emerge from the Nunesphere is the suggestion that maybe the person speaking to Parnas on Nunes’s phone all those times was somebody other than Devin Nunes:

Fox ""legal analyst"" Gregg Jarrett says that maybe Devin Nunes did *not* have calls with with Giuliani, the White House, and Lev Parnas, because it could've been ""somebody else"" using Nunes' phone, ""we just don't know."" pic.twitter.com/84ytkoTf1O — Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) December 4, 2019

The House Intelligence Committee also has some bad news for Nunes’s former aide, Kash Patel. In October, the New York Times reported that Patel, whose official role is supposed to concern counterterrorism, helped direct Ukraine policy (specifically, Trump’s scheme to leverage Ukraine for political gain). Patel sued the Times, denying he had “played a role in shadow foreign policy.” Unfortunately for Patel, the House report has call records showing his number too:

Call records also show that around midday on May 10, Mr. Giuliani began trading aborted calls with Kashyap “Kash” Patel, an official at the National Security Council who previously served on Ranking Member Devin Nunes’ staff on the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Patel successfully connected with Mr. Giuliani less than an hour after Mr. Giuliani’s call with Ambassador Volker. Beginning at 3:23 p.m., Eastern Time, Mr. Patel and Mr. Giuliani spoke for over 25 minutes. Five minutes after Mr. Patel and Mr. Giuliani disconnected, an unidentified “-1” number connected with Mr. Giuliani for over 17 minutes. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Giuliani spoke with Mr. Parnas for approximately 12 minutes.

The records don’t say what Patel discussed with Giuliani, but the timing sure seems to indicate that the subject was Ukraine.

One might get the impression that the whole Nunes operation revolves around generating wild lies to defend Trump, funneling those lies through right-wing propaganda outlets, and bullying news organizations who debunk the lies with expensive lawsuits designed to intimidate them."

When Kamala Harris announced her presidential campaign in January, Rachel Maddow told her, “I think there is a good chance that you are going to win the nomination.” Soon after, Harris’s 20,000-plus-person kickoff rally in Oakland exceeded expectations set by party chiefs who saw in her an aspirational candidate who could represent the heart of the party both ideologically and demographically. Six months later, when the California senator challenged Joe Biden onstage at the first debate in Miami — surprising everyone, and delivering the most memorable lines of the campaign — her moment seemed to arrive.

But Harris was uneasy even as she vaulted toward the field’s top tier in the ensuing days. She cringed at how the coverage was painting her as the race’s anti-Biden attack artist, not as a nimble realist able to build consensus between the party’s warring factions, as she believed herself to be. She hesitated as some advisors encouraged her to re-embrace the strategy and single out Biden again in the next debate, in Detroit. She delivered no scripted strike, and instead took a pummeling from him and others now eager to take her down a peg. “That wasn’t great,” campaign donors told her at suddenly nervy private fundraising events over the next few days. “That’s an understatement,” she responded.

Harris, however, never reversed and went after Biden. That, she told her inner circle, wasn’t her. Instead, until late this fall — just weeks before she pulled the plug on her campaign on Tuesday afternoon, after reviewing its finances and chances over the Thanksgiving weekend — Harris routinely insisted that she was still introducing herself to Americans. But Harris’s campaign, dogged for months by questions about her health-care stance, her political ideology, and, ultimately, her staff’s infighting, never seemed to settle on a single consistent answer to a question voters kept asking: What was she about? At times on the trail, she presented herself as a matter-of-fact progressive, a comforter-in-chief, and an unapologetic prosecutor. Harris, and those who’ve known her for decades, insist all of these are accurate descriptors, but that at her core she’s a results-oriented pragmatist with a long-running disdain for ideological boxes. That, they often said, is precisely what the country could have used right about now. Yet as Harris tried appealing to as broad a swath of the Democratic electorate as possible, she found that in an overflowing field led by three far better-known characters, being a consensus-style candidate who can offer something to everyone meant it was especially difficult to offer everything to anyone.

When Harris sat down over the weekend to re-evaluate her plans and dig deep into her campaign’s financial state after a pair of brutal reports from the New York Times and Washington Post, she saw an operation quickly running out of cash and low on realistic paths to victory, even though she already qualified for the December debate. She spoke with family and close aides, and considered both her short-term options and her political future beyond the primary race. On Monday, she determined there was no politically acceptable way for her sputtering campaign to keep competing. She opted for an abrupt halt to a fall that would have been unfathomable back in Oakland in January, but which could have worsened in the unforgiving Iowa winter.

It would soon get harder, but at the time, the aftermath of the Detroit debate felt like a new low for Harris’s campaign. Looking back four months later, that stretch crystalized what went wrong. As she struggled to find a meeting of minds with the voters she needed between spring and fall — while Biden held onto his support and Elizabeth Warren gained steam — Harris and her team tried out a series of different messages. They didn’t stop trying until they ultimately settled on “Justice Is on the Ballot” late this year. Some political allies urged her to return to the “fearless” message she’d used while running for Senate in 2016. (“Fearless” was also the name of a TV ad she’d ran that was based around footage of Warren praising her.) Others grumbled that her early focus on “truths” meant little to voters, and that her subsequent “3 A.M. Agenda” wasn’t ambitious enough. “Sometimes her over-preparation comes across as a lack of preparation,” said one of her advisors. Still, most in Harris’s corner were convinced that she was close to hitting the right note. “The political consultant class gnashes their teeth over this — they have to market a product,” a Harris friend and longtime political ally told me this fall. “The problem that they have is: She is what she is. She’s complicated.” After the second debate, her team advised her to start telling more personal stories on the campaign trail, fearing the career prosecutor who was campaigning on her toughness was coming across as too lawyerly.

But then, and throughout the campaign, the advice wasn’t always consistent. “I don’t know who’s in charge,” one former Harris aide who remains close with her team told me repeatedly over the summer and fall. Harris has long been surrounded by a wide array of advisors — in addition to campaign chair Maya Harris (her sister), and campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, there were strategists Sean Clegg, Ace Smith, and Laphonza Butler, former chief of staff Rohini Kosoglu, adman Jim Margolis, and pollster David Binder, among others. “It’s a Kamala thing to have 9,000 people whispering in her ears, thinking they’re running the show,” said another of her ex-aides.

For nearly a year, her allies privately downplayed the importance of Iowa’s caucuses and New Hampshire’s primary to their ultimate strategy, insisting her strength would come in the more diverse Nevada and South Carolina, and then in the big March-voting states, beginning with California. But over the fall and early winter, Harris was forced to effectively shutter her campaign outside of Iowa and, to a lesser extent, South Carolina, in a dramatic but uncertain attempt to free up whatever resources were available for a last-ditch run at those states. (“I’m fucking moving to Iowa,” she was overheard telling Senator Mazie Hirono this fall.) As she slipped into fifth place or worse in national polling, and as she fell far behind in the first-to-caucus state where she bet it all, she cut her payroll and struggled to raise money, all while fighting off a widening stream of stories about disarray among remaining aides. Staff morale plummeted, and private finger-pointing burst into public, with her campaign manager and her sister mired in the middle.

Evidence existed that Harris was connecting with the voters who were still coming to see her and her latest message while she hosted intimate meet-ups and voter dinners — she often ended events hugging and consoling crying Iowans who’d just revealed stories of runaway health-care costs or job loss or gun violence. But her crowds were frequently dwarfed by most of her front-running rivals, as once-Kamala-curious Iowans who’d first seen her lighting up Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr, and Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill gravitated elsewhere in the intervening months. And positive November developments — a well-received speech at the same closely-watched pre-caucus fundraising dinner that breathed life into Barack Obama’s campaign in 2007, an endorsement from the influential United Farm Workers union, Thanksgiving in Iowa, and a debate performance widely seen as a much-needed rebound — did little for her polling, which was stuck in mid-single digits, or her fundraising, which flatlined, then bottomed out. Where she was once a widely-liked contender frequently named as voters’ second choice candidate, her net favorability rating dropped by about 25 points in Iowa between June and November, according to in-state polling.

On a gray afternoon late this fall, Harris sat across from me on the second floor of a t-shirt shop in Cedar Rapids, her final stop on a three-day, six-town swing in the eastern part of the state, and explained that she thought voters had a hard time grasping her candidacy because they’d never seen a presidential hopeful quite like her.

Throughout her campaign, Harris, 55, projected a “Can you believe this shit?” air in public when talking about Donald Trump or the day’s latest outrage. But in person, when she was comfortable, she was more analytical. She could be startlingly jocular at times — once, in August, when we were finishing an interview on her campaign bus, rolling up to a Muscatine senior center where she’d lead the residents in a game of bingo, she exuberantly burst out singing, “B-I-N-G-O!” and exhorted her heretofore quiet aides to join in. But she was more often deliberate. Still, as her campaign matured and fumbled, she grew more open to allowing glimpses of how the Trump age and the presidential race hit her personally, which occasionally meant barely masking her frustration.

At the t-shirt shop, she raised her eyebrows and, with a little smile that then turned serious, said she’d been thinking about something, and was going to try it out on me. She was going to say a phrase, and would ask what image I pictured in response. “The boy next door,” she said, then paused. That week, all the buzz on the ground in the state had been about Pete Buttigieg. “There is an image there. And you can think about certain people on the debate stage that could be attributed to.”

“Are there four words who would describe who I am? There’s no frame of reference,” she continued. Exactly a week later she’d announce a mass staff layoff and underscore the extent of her bet on Iowa, to try and catch up to Buttigieg, but also Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Warren. “Like, we have terms for that guy. He’s the boy next door. That’s your uncle, who’s at the Thanksgiving dinner, who does this thing and that. There are images. The girl next door, there’s an image for that, too.”

“Is there enough time?” one of Harris’s longest-standing political allies asked me as early as September. “I don’t know.” A few weeks later, most of the political world had decided, basically, that there was not. That didn’t stop Harris advisors from pointing out that in late 2003 — the last time a Republican president loathed by the left was up for re-election — John Kerry still trailed Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt in Iowa, which he then won. Perhaps thinking it unwise to compare herself to Kerry, Harris never talked much about that race. But late this fall, after months of pleas from her aides to tell more personal stories, she started speaking about her own time in Iowa 12 years ago, door-knocking for another candidate who was still far behind at that point. Obama’s campaign, too, was described as listless and overmatched before its own Iowa relaunch.

Often, she’d tell the story of meeting an elderly woman at an African-American senior center in Des Moines the night before the 2008 caucuses and convincing her to turn out for Obama even after the woman told her, “They not gonna let him win.” Harris would make the case that her challenge was simply convincing voters she could beat Trump. But by that point, the comeback she’d need just to stay in the game in Iowa — a state where voters and kingmakers pride themselves on their discernment and their patience in making up their minds — was far bigger than both Obama’s and Kerry’s were. In October, I spotted former Iowa Representative Dave Nagle hanging out in the back of a Harris town hall in Waterloo. Nagle, who left Congress 26 years ago and hasn’t endorsed any 2020 candidate, praised Harris’s ambitions in the state, but was far from convinced: He said she had dropped by his office building earlier in the year for a separate meeting, but had neglected to stop by and say hello to him. “As Charlie Brown said, there’s no greater burden than great potential,” he said.

At the time, Harris’s advisors were insisting she could still win if she finished in the top three in Iowa (some privately said top two), and they hoped Trump’s impeachment would return the former prosecutor to voters’ minds. Harris herself, though, hesitated to call the inquiry good for her campaign when Nancy Pelosi first announced it. When I asked her the next day, by phone, whether her history in law enforcement might give her an opening during months of impeachment talk, she replied, “Well, I mean, I suppose there is that.” Soon, though, she became convinced she could make up ground by focusing on Trump: She took to calling him a “walking indictment in a red tie.” Later in the fall, she told me: “He literally told us who he is when he said, ‘I could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue.’ He was saying, ‘I can commit a crime,’ meaning, ‘I’m willing to think that I might, and if I do, I would get away with it.”

Still, “I understand!,” she said of voters’ hesitation while addressing a local party fundraiser in a dark DoubleTree hotel ballroom in Cedar Rapids in October. “People are saying, ‘Maybe it’s not your turn, maybe it’s not your time,’” she continued, over the clink of silverware. “But I will tell you, Linn County, I’ve heard this conversation in every campaign I have — and now here’s the operative word — won.” She was trying to convince Iowans she was still worth considering as her campaign — running perilously low on cash — scrambled to raise enough money to put a new ad on air, or even online. She repeated the line until the campaign’s final days.

The first time I heard a journalist straight-up ask Harris if she would run for president was less than two months after she joined the Senate in 2017. The first time one of her then-likely opponents described to me why she’d be a serious contender was that summer. The first time I heard someone in her orbit outline her possible path to the nomination was before the midterms. This autumn, when it was becoming clear that Harris was struggling to break through to the surprisingly solid top rank of candidates, I started hearing from a quiet cadre in her orbit that believed if she could find a way to last long enough in the race — deep into next year — she might be well positioned to compete in a contested convention next July. That view gained purchase among some of her most loyal supporters, who saw a drawn-out fight as a very long-shot best-case scenario.

But others, including many in her inner circle, wondered how much longer Harris would be willing to stay in a race where she was stuck responding to others and unable to gain attention on her own terms. One of their concerns: That Harris’s name would remain on the California ballot even if she was no longer a viable candidate by the state’s March primary, which could lead to an embarrassing result that further weakened her political standing at home. Even after what Harris’s team thought was a standout performance at November’s debate, it was Buttigieg who gained the most potential new supporters in its immediate aftermath, according to FiveThirtyEight’s overnight polling. Among some aides and allies, whispers about Harris’s future were common — whether she might have a future in someone else’s presidential cabinet; whether she might have to worry about a primary challenge to her Senate seat in 2022; or if there might be room for her to run for the presidency again in 2024 (if Trump is re-elected) or 2028. “I do think she has another shot at this,” said Randi Weingarten, the influential president of the American Federation of Teachers union, in late October.

Harris herself never talked this way, of course — until the final days, she’d pepper her speeches with “I intend to win!” — but she thought, and spoke, more about representation, and what her candidacy meant, in recent weeks. “The feeling that I have, the sense of responsibility to be on that stage, and to do well on that stage because of that responsibility — I never want to disappoint anybody,” she told me in Cedar Rapids, reflecting on her status as the most prominent black woman candidate ever, and just the second since Shirley Chisholm nearly half a century earlier, and a child of immigrants. This was a conversation she’d had with her family when she first decided to run, she said. “Because I know what being on that stage means to a lot of people, and for a lot of people. And I carry that, as something that is heavy. Meaning it is very important.”

Harris’s struggle to get the right voters to truly understand her pitch began the day after her Oakland launch. Rarely has a campaign gone from such a high to damage control so immediately. Speaking with Jake Tapper in Des Moines for a televised town hall, Harris answered a question about private health-care coverage by unspooling a long answer about insurance company bureaucracy that included the line, “Let’s eliminate all of that, let’s move on.” Harris had been the first senator to sign onto Sanders’s famous Medicare for All bill a year-and-a-half earlier, but she’d also co-sponsored a more modest scheme that would permit private insurance in some cases, so it wasn’t yet clear how she’d position herself in the race. The next day, a Harris advisor told CNN she would be open to moderate proposals allowing for some private insurance coverage, and thus began a mind-numbing saga that turned into a media proxy for Harris’s ideological flexibility and unwillingness to be pinned down on policy. In April, she told Pod Save America: “I’m not saying we need to get rid of private insurance.”

By May, she was trying to get off the health-care topic as she leaned into her prosecutorial experience on the trail as a way of contrasting directly with Trump, a pivot that inflamed internal campaign tensions — and questions about decision flow — that were never resolved. On one side was Harris’s sister Maya, her campaign chair who is especially attuned to the activist left. On the other was a set of Harris’s strategists including Clegg and Smith, who saw more opportunity in a more moderate tack. Then, in June, she raised her hand on the debate stage when asked if candidates would “abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan,” only to, afterward, say she thought the question was if she’d give up her own coverage. Finally, in July, Harris released her own plan, with a longer transition period away from private insurance than Sanders’s, but a narrative was already set about her caution and perceived flip-flops. It was en vogue then to compare her to Marco Rubio — a GOP Establishment favorite “candidate of the future,” until he wasn’t, in 2016 — or, as Nate Silver did, to Mitt Romney: “Hits all her marks, positioned quite optimally toward the middle of the primary electorate and has the potential to unite different wings — but voters aren’t entirely clear what she stands for,” he tweeted late that month.

For left-wing activists already suspicious of Harris because of her prosecutorial record, it was all further evidence that she was no true progressive. For wary moderates and conservatives, it was reason enough to think she stood for radical change. All the while, Biden’s support was holding firm and Warren’s was only growing, contrary to the long-standing projections of Harris’s inner circle. Behind the scenes, aides agreed Harris needed a serious fix, and soon, but the lack of a clear chain of command bogged down their decision-making, and territorial tensions ruled out collaboration between some of the team’s most important players.

Yet Warren’s rise through the summer was also forcing Harris into a conversation she found counterproductive, especially during her first extended tour of Iowa, in August. “No false choices” had been something of a personal slogan of hers earlier in her career, and she now saw no contradiction in saying one day that she was not trying to restructure society and another standing for the Green New Deal and eliminating the Senate filibuster to achieve it. Harris refused to pinpoint herself on the Biden-to-Sanders political spectrum, even when asked point-blank. “I think it’s just a nice subject for a graduate class, but it’s not how people are living life,” she told Bloomberg. Later that day, while meeting with farmers in Lacona, Iowa, she said, unprompted, “You don’t have the luxury of engaging in some intellectual political conversation about what we need to grow and thrive.”

“It is frustrating,” she said to me the next day on her shiny black campaign bus (with “KAMALA” written on its side in yellow, blue, and red). “And it’s frustrating because — I mean, this sounds so cliche — but it’s the labels, right? And it tends to oversimplify issues, and it tends to reward or induce a requirement to have really discrete — and not many — categories. And so, ‘Which of these few categories do you fit in?’ Those categories that have been pre-designated, by the way, by other people. And I just refuse to do that.” She leaned forward with her arms crossed, sitting across from a map of the state stuck up on the wall with pins marking her stops in the state. A handful of aides sat around, listening quietly and nodding knowingly. Some pretended not to be listening in. They’d all heard this from her before, and would again. This question “never comes up with voters,” she said. “It never comes up with voters Never! Voters don’t have time for that.”

Harris then decided to play strategist. Upon leaving the state, she called each member of her senior staff. The political territory in Iowa felt more fertile than expected, she told them, and, recalling her time campaigning for Obama in 2007, she said she saw an opportunity to compete seriously there if she could spend enough time on the ground to prove she could win. She directed Rodriguez to draw up an entirely new plan: To make sure she’d now have enough resources to compete in Iowa and increase her in-state staffing, and to fill the fall with stops in the state. In September, she announced her first surprise pivot to Iowa. Soon after, she redrew her campaign’s organization to give Kosoglu a formal role and hand Butler direct reports, aiming to establish order.

That discipline never arrived, and she also spent nearly all of late August and September off the trail, raising money — which was supposed to come easier to her given her history running high-dollar campaigns in California, but which was both an increasingly difficult task amid Buttigieg’s rise and her plateauing polls, and doubly important to fund her Iowa push. For over a month, she didn’t visit Iowa. When she started returning, her crowds were smaller, the focus elsewhere. With the media’s eyes on other candidates, Harris resumed talking about health-care — promoting her proposal’s protection of union workers’ plans, and calling it “Medicare for All.”

A few weeks later, she tried putting a more positive spin on the lingering questions about her political identity. Harris was in Los Angeles, taking a quick break from a West Coast fundraising swing, and when I asked about her struggles explaining her health-care position to a national audience, she grew reflective. “It can often just be the inability to see something they’ve never seen before, so they want to put it in a box that they have seen before. So it’s maybe an oversimplification. That’s the challenge, really,” she said, sounding far less exasperated than on the bus, slightly more at peace with this existential challenge. She was “asking people to see something they’ve never seen before. And I know it is asking a lot, and I say, based on experience: I know people are up for it.”

In September, a Los Angeles Times survey revealed that Democratic voters identified Harris as their closest ideological fit, after all. A week later, a poll conducted by Binder, working for another client, showed her slipping into sixth place in Iowa, down 13 points from mid-summer.

Since the day Harris launched her campaign in January, some Democrats in her orbit wondered aloud whether it’d be worth starting a super PAC to support her. The notion was always knocked down as other candidates rejected help from such outside groups, but the idea never quite died.

Late Tuesday morning, operatives monitoring TV ad spending noticed that a brand-new super PAC had started placing buys to run a pro-Harris spot in Iowa. It was a last-ditch, million dollar effort created by long-time aides to prop her up as her own campaign effectively ran out of cash as she criss-crossed the state. The cavalry wasn’t quite arriving to save her, but here, at least, was a much-needed last-second boost. The plan was to air a minute-long video that featured Harris grilling Barr, Kavanaugh, and Sessions, and closed by calling her “the Democrat for president that Donald Trump fears most.”

Early Tuesday afternoon, Harris got on a conference call with what remained of her campaign staff. She thanked them for their work, but told them this was the end of the road.

“I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,” she wrote in a final email to supporters. “I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do.”

Within an hour, the super PAC canceled its ad buy.

The story received widespread attention. In a video uploaded to Instagram on Monday, van Amstel said he had been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, adding, “Josh and I and our son, we did not expect how many reactions we would get.”

An Amsterdam-born former dance coach on “Dancing With the Stars” who now serves as a judge in a Netherlands version of the show, van Amstel has lived with his husband in Utah for about three years, running a fitness program in Salt Lake City. The couple started the adoption process about a year ago and met their son, age 11, earlier this year. They expect the adoption to be finalized later this month.

Van Amstel told The Washington Post that his family had felt welcome in their community. “Not once have I been treated like how this woman treated us,” he said.

The incident happened Nov. 21 at the public school in Cedar Hills, part of the Alpine School District. Students, responding to a question from the substitute teacher, said they were thankful for turkey, their pets and not having to go to school during the holidays, the Tribune reported.

But when the boy gave thanks for his adoptive fathers, the teacher told him it was “nothing to be grateful for” and lectured the class about how “homosexuality is wrong.” The three girls went to the principal’s office after trying — unsuccessfully — to get the teacher to stop.

The school acted quickly, van Amstel said. The teacher was escorted out of the school, defending her comments and blaming the boy along the way. An Alpine School District spokesman told the Tribune that the district has a strict nondiscrimination policy and that “appropriate action” had been taken.

Van Amstel said his son initially didn’t want to tell his parents what happened, fearing it might jeopardize his adoption. He had come close to being adopted previously, only for it to fall through. Instead, van Amstel said, he cried when he heard the boy’s response to the teacher’s question.

“We knew the moment we met him that this is our son,” he said.

MARION, Iowa — “We're going to try something different,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Sunday night. “You all are my experimental group.”

That got some laughter from the crowd, 350 or so Iowans out to see a candidate whose “front-runner” status had evaporated sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving. Warren was serious. Out was the finely crafted stump speech, with reminiscences of her mother putting on her Sunday best (“you all know the dress”) and working to save her family. Out were the applause lines about how “unions will rebuild the middle class” and how the Supreme Court should follow “basic standards of ethics.”

Instead, Warren talked for a fast eight minutes, then took questions for an hour — impeachment, Medicare-for-all, impeachment again, and whether there was a moment in her life “where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn't accept you as much.” After steadily losing support to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Warren was working to remind Iowans why they'd liked her in the first place: She was the candidate with plans. Remember that?

The Marion town hall, followed by an event in Iowa City where she continued the ask-anything format, was Warren's way of acknowledging that something had gone wrong. She would never say so outright. Warren's campaign has avoided talk about the horse race or its plan of attack, even in better days.

Over the summer, when an Iowa poll found Warren leading for the first time, her campaign told staff not to talk about it, and they obliged, a dogma that continued through the year. Reporters who get time with Warren, usually in short gaggles after her town halls, have learned that any horse race question will get a happy non-answer about why the senator is “in this fight” or why she isn't paying attention to polls.

“No,” Warren told reporters in Iowa City, when asked whether she was adjusting her campaign after a downswing. “This is a chance to just talk to more people, and hear their questions, and field more questions. I've been fielding questions since the very first event I did right at the beginning in Iowa.”

It's true that Warren has done this before; it's also true that she's shaking things up. As it rose, Warren's campaign refused to engage with most negative attacks, not even dispatching surrogates for cable TV segments. Warren herself avoided TV interviews, ignored Sunday talk shows and seldom responded to the (often-Trump-centric) news of the day.

There are signs of change, with Warren expected to sit for several cable interviews this week and top surrogates such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts expected to do more TV work as the impeachment drama continues. The Marion town hall produced one of Warren's first viral moments in weeks, when she comforted a member of the LGBTQ community with an emotional story about her divorce.

That was new. Warren's media strategy until Marion had come with disadvantages, exacerbated by her support for Medicare-for-all, which she opted to defend conceptually and funded with a complicated mix of tax increases on the wealthy and employers. Four years earlier, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) challenged Hillary Clinton from the left, not a single negative ad ran in Iowa about his health-care plan, and Sanders did not release an outline for Medicare-for-all until two weeks before the caucuses. This year, attacks on the least popular aspect of Medicare-for-all began six months before anyone would vote.

Over the summer, the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a coalition of insurers, bought half of all political advertising in Iowa. As the leaves changed, Buttigieg and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado both began running ads that emphasized how they would expand government insurance coverage without touching private insurance — unlike Warren, or Sanders. The ads did not mention specific candidates, but the splashback hit Warren, who did not counterpunch unless directly attacked.

In mid-November, Warren partially broke with Sanders with her own transition plan, which would delay the end of private insurance. The attacks didn't stop, and the battle did damage that the campaign knew it needed to reverse. In Marion, she packed her plan for Medicare into three tight minutes: using executive powers to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, using budget reconciliation to lower the enrollment age and pull millions of people into the system, then teeing up a battle with weakened insurance companies.

“I think America is going to say: I'm on board, I get it, I like how this works,” Warren said. “I think that is how we're going to get the most help early in the process, and we're going to be able to open it up. So, it's not about fighting among Americans; it's about how to get health care to every single American at the lowest possible cost.”

One word in that answer — “fighting” — got to Warren's problem. Until her opponents zeroed in on Medicare-for-all, Warren was most strongly identified with her plan for an incremental wealth tax (“two cents, two cents”) that paid for an expansive liberal agenda without asking the vast majority of Americans to pay more. Instead of arguing with any primary opponents, Warren was arguing with billionaires, which she relished. In October and November, she was arguing with fellow Democrats, which she didn't, and Buttigieg flourished by both criticizing Warren's tone and by promising not to get wrapped up in “fighting.”

That has pulled voters away from Warren, sometimes visibly; there were empty seats in a Sunday afternoon event in Waterloo, which drew 175 people in a reliably Democratic town. (Terrance Hollingsworth, who'd organized a summer house party for Warren, said she shouldn't have come to the black part of Waterloo while many voters were at church.) Warren had kicked off the weekend with a rally of around 3,000 supporters in Chicago, which quieted the talk of a fade-out.

Warren's voters were paying attention to the setbacks. At Sunday's events, some used words such as “uncomfortable” to describe how Warren had handled attacks on her policies, though some added that they wanted to see a woman in the White House. (The surprise exit from the race by Sen. Kamala D. Harris has increased the chance that Warren would be the last woman standing in Iowa.) In Waterloo, Ken and Mary Huffman, both 69, were divided — Ken was all in on Warren, while Mary had been dismayed by the Medicare conversation.

“I like what Buttigieg is saying, especially his Medicare for those who want it,” said Mary Huffman. “I've read that there are concerns about whether her plan is enough to pay for that.” Warren's eventual payment and transition plans, she said, had “swayed” her, but not enough to pick a side of the fence.

It's Buttigieg, not Sanders, who Warren-world sees as her biggest problem in Iowa. The Sanders campaign shares that theory, seeing no threat to itself from Buttigieg's more comfortable, college-educated and white coalition, in Iowa or elsewhere. Warren's campaign, with eight weeks to turn things around, is watching to see whether Buttigieg can hold up to scrutiny; while that happens, it's working to restore the image Warren had over the summer as the candidate who could plan for anything and answer any question. It wouldn't abandon the “fight” framing, even as Buttigieg seemed to gain by attacking it.

“It is easy to give up on big ideas,” Warren said. “It makes you sound smart and sophisticated: Just give up on the big ideas! But when we give up on the big ideas, we give up on the people who would be touched by those ideas. Most people are already in a fight.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, who ended her campaign for the presidency Tuesday, was not like other Democrats who'd dropped out. She had 15 endorsements from members of Congress — 16, before the resignation of California's Katie Hill. She'd made inroads with local leaders and elected Democrats across early states. In two weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the loudest liberal voices in the party, was set to campaign for her in Iowa.

That seemed natural, more natural than the slow, brutal collapse of her campaign. At the start of this decade, when Elizabeth Warren was teaching at Harvard and Pete Buttigieg had just left McKinsey & Co., Harris was seen as a potential president, a “female Obama” whose Jamaican and Indian heritage made her intriguing to an increasingly diverse party.

What happened next was a classic political tragedy, a rise and rise and rise followed by a steep fall. Even Democrats who wanted to beat Harris had mixed feelings about what was happening. Harris was labeled a “cop” for a criminal justice record that was dissected for steps that angered activists (an anti-truancy policy that arrested parents, more than 1,000 marijuana convictions) while other moves (opposition to the death penalty that nearly cost her an election) were forgotten. Harris was the first of many Democrats to get whipsawed by the details of Medicare-for-all, and propose some changes to it, which hurt her in ways it never hurt Pete Buttigieg or Elizabeth Warren.

Even some of Harris's setbacks sat uneasily with some Democrats. Her problems began early, with an in-public struggle to define why she was running, and some high-profile events, such as She the People's summit in Houston and the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco, where she gave unmemorable answers or speeches.

But Harris had surged in the polls after criticizing Joe Biden's previous opposition to busing, which ended up showing how resilient Biden's black support really was — a problem for every one of his rivals. Her worst onstage moment came when Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii unloaded on her California record, which turned Gabbard into a favorite of Republicans, encouraging her to go on the attack in later debates. (The Trump campaign quickly congratulated Gabbard after Harris's announcement; Gabbard herself tweeted that “while we disagree on some issues, we agree on others and I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people.”)

By November, Harris was not seen as a threat to the highest-polling Democrats, but her departure mattered in two big ways.

Harris had more legislative endorsements than any Democrat except Joe Biden, and more of them from nonwhite legislators. Those supporters, and some who were staying neutral to see whether Harris could recover, are now free agents, getting fresh overtures from rival campaigns. (One congressional endorser texted The Post about his plans with an emoji of a confused person shrugging.) Endorsements have not driven many votes in this primary, but Harris's included Rep. Barbara Lee, a leader of the party's left who once urged Bernie Sanders to run for president, and an army of local elected officials in California, where no Democrat has a clear advantage.

Harris was also the only nonwhite candidate who had qualified for December's debate in her home state, something that quickly dawned on activists and elected officials. The most diverse contest in presidential history, a race that once featured more women than men, had gotten very white. Two nonwhite Democrats are close to making the stage (Andrew Yang and, in a small irony, Tulsi Gabbard), but Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is not. Neither is former HUD secretary Julián Castro, who was cut from November's debate and was one of the first Democrats to defend Harris.

“The way that the media treated Senator Harris in this campaign has been something else,” Castro told CBS News reporter Tim Perry on Tuesday. “In the last few days, to see articles out of Politico, the New York Times, Washington Post, that have basically trashed her campaign and focused on just one small part of it, and I think held her to a different standard, a double standard, has been grossly unfair and unfortunate.”

Those articles had accurately conveyed the problems that ended Harris's campaign: muddled messaging, uncertain leadership and some scheduling errors that got noticed by activists and donors. But in the final weeks of her candidacy, Harris's stump speech had asked why nonwhite or female candidates were seen as less “electable” by voters still stunned by Donald Trump's 2016 win. Harris would tell voters that she was called unelectable in “every race that I have — here is the operative word — won.” On Tuesday afternoon, Democrats angry that the debate rules, demanding increasingly high poll numbers and donations for entry, had let the wealthy Tom Steyer onstage while excluding talented nonwhite candidates.

“That debate stage currently will not look like America,” said former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan.

“No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic,” said Leah Greenberg, the co-founder of the left-wing organizing group Indivisible. “We need leaders who represent the diversity of our party. The myth of 'electability' and the bias associated with it has done huge damage this cycle.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Amy Klobuchar, “Questions.” The senator from Minnesota's first spots in Iowa and New Hampshire portrayed her as a moderate who could unite the country and calm things down. Her new ad gets into one of the Democrats' most popular policies, using government power to flatten the costs of prescription drugs, without getting into the details. The message is more like the one typically deployed by populists: Drug companies get away with murder, sometimes literally, because no one stands up to them. “Why do drug companies make billions of dollars getting people hooked on opioids?” she asks. “The big pharmaceutical companies, they think they own Washington. Well, they don’t own me.”

Pete Buttigieg, “Welcomed Me.” The mayor's first South Carolina ad is the latest in a series that uses footage from his speech to the Liberty and Justice Celebration in Iowa. It recycles a Bible quote that other Democrats have used, but Buttigieg has really grabbed onto: “In our White House, you won’t have to shake your head and ask yourself, “Whatever happened to ‘I was hungry and you fed me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me?' ” There are more black voters pictured on-screen than in previous Buttigieg spots, but as part of a diverse mix.

2020

Kamala Harris wasn't the only Democrat to bow out of the Democratic race this week. On Monday, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced the end of his own campaign, saying in a statement that he “won’t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field.” To the consternation of Washington Democrats, who had urged him to forgo this race and run for Senate, he said he was seeking no other office.

Bullock had spent more than a year setting up a run, making stops in Iowa for local Democrats and fixating on a simple, consistent message: He’d won three elections in a red state, unlike literally everyone else running for president.

His biggest problem was that they actually started running for president, months before he did. Bullock, a Democrat presiding over a Republican legislature that meets for only a few months, spent the winter and spring of 2019 pushing through an extension of the state’s Medicaid expansion. When he declared his candidacy in May, he’d already missed out on months of organizing and fundraising.

Iowans did not seem care about that, and Bullock attracted sizable crowds in his first visits to the state. But he never broke through in a race in which Joe Biden, despite some stumbles, held onto a pile of moderate votes, and in which Pete Buttigieg had a head start, a compelling pitch — lighter on accomplishments, heavier on inspiration. Bullock’s one moment in the national spotlight, the second Democratic debate, was a missed opportunity, where he became part of a blur of low-polling candidates warning the party not to go far to the left.

Michael F. Bennet. He declared a sort of solidarity with Bullock after the governor ended his campaign, condemning DNC debate rules for leaving candidates like them (who have not reached the donor or polling thresholds) outside. “The fight to win back voters who abandoned our party for Donald Trump isn’t hopeless,” Bennet said. “It runs through battle-tested candidates from swing states, who know how to meet Americans where they are — not where the loudest voices on social media think they ought to be. It’s unfortunate that the DNC couldn’t make room for a perspective like that.”

Amy Klobuchar. She won over Iowa state Rep. Bruce Bearinger, who had previously endorsed Bullock.

Elizabeth Warren. She released a “fair workweek” plan, spelling out new labor rights for workers with variable schedules. Among the rules: requiring employers to give at least two weeks of notice on scheduling, family leave benefits for some part-time workers, and regulations that would prevent employers from taking advantage of those same part-time workers.

Joe Biden. He picked up the support of California Rep. Ami Bera, shortly before Harris left the race. (As noted above, that will free up a large number of California endorsers.)

Mike Bloomberg. He traveled to Jackson, Miss., on Tuesday for a criminal justice reform meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who has worked with Bernie Sanders but is neutral in the primary.

Cory Booker. He's returning to Iowa around this weekend's multiple cattle calls for an expansive “lead with love” tour.

Tom Steyer. He qualified for the December debate in Los Angeles by reaching more than 200,000 unique donations.

ON THE TRAIL

OKATIE, S.C. — On Sunday, in Iowa, Joe Biden told NBC News that he would not get into an argument with Pete Buttigieg. “Anything I say about Pete will be taken as maybe criticism or a negative about Pete,” Biden said. “I don’t have any negative feelings about Pete at all. I think he’s a talented guy.”

Twenty-four hours later, something changed. In an interview with the reporters following his ""No Malarkey"" tour, Biden scoffed at the idea that Buttigieg's ""Medicare for all who want it"" had caught on, saying he ""stole"" the plan from Biden's similar public option and Medicare buy-in.

“What would you have done to me? You would have torn my ears off,” Biden said. “I would be a plagiarizing, no-good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.”

Buttigieg, who has grappled with other Democrats, declined to spar with Biden. Speaking with reporters after a forum with Latino voters, Buttigieg said only that the former vice president was mistaken.

“I've been talking about Medicare for all who wanted since at least February,” Buttigieg said, “and also, the plans are not exactly the same. You know, we've got to focus on capping out-of-pocket costs and focus on a glide path that I think very well could lead to a Medicare-for-all environment. Of course, I believe that our approach on health care is the best one. And I'm willing to bring that plan out and compete with any of my competitors on having the best plan.”

Pressed again on what it meant that Biden went negative, Buttigieg said that it meant “that we've got an excellent plan.”

Biden's criticism stood out largely because it was new. The four highest-polling Democrats are now split, two and two, on whether America's mixed health-insurance system should be replaced by universal Medicare. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren favor replacement (one over four years, one only after Medicare is expanded to a near-universal program), and had scrapped with both Biden and Buttigieg. And Buttigieg still has more of an argument with the liberal senators; asked whether his plan would cover noncitizens, as Medicare-for-all does, he said it was more complicated.

“I do think that everybody should be eligible to buy in to Medicare for all who wanted the public plan,” Buttigieg said. “But I would expect that you'd have to be a citizen to qualify for subsidies.”

The reports new argument… [+5674 chars]",The formal GOP defense of Trump isn't just laughable. It's self-undermining.,2019-12-03,The Washington Post,"Laughable new GOP report: Yes, Trump did it. But his motives were pure!",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/03/laughable-new-gop-report-yes-trump-did-it-his-motives-were-pure/,"House Republicans have now formalized their defense of Trump with the release of a new report as the impeachment process shifts into its next phase, and at the center of it is an effort to make that corrupt motive disappear entirely.

AD

The report’s new argument is that, yes, Trump might have made requests of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce “investigations” that would validate Trump’s (invented) theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and his (fabricated) narrative of corruption on the part of Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine.

AD

But, Republicans say, Trump was right to do this, because his concerns about these things were legitimate and were subsumed into a much broader — and, again, legitimate — set of concerns about corruption.

The argument is a joke. But it also illustrates in a backhand way just how unconvincing any effort to sanitize away Trump’s corrupt motives must inevitably be.

AD

The GOP argument requires ignoring voluminous evidence of those corrupt motives. It also requires accepting the spectacularly absurd idea that the investigations Trump actually did ask for were not just motivated by a general desire to fight corruption but also benefited Trump politically out of pure coincidence.

The narcissism defense

The report’s argument is that Trump didn’t baldly condition official acts (a White House meeting; hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid) on getting Zelensky to announce those investigations. But it was legitimate for Trump to hesitate in granting them, because his request for those investigations was reasonable.

AD

AD

To buttress this, the report claims Trump holds a “deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism” of Ukraine’s “history of pervasive corruption.” This means Trump’s “hesitation” to grant the meeting and military aid was “entirely prudent.”

The report selectively quotes testimony that Trump saw Ukraine as a corrupt country. But then the report brazenly cites Trump’s concerns about Ukrainians opposing him in the 2016 election as grounds for Trump’s dim views of Ukraine!

The report cites cherry-picked facts to suggest those concerns were legitimate. But as Glenn Kessler has shown, the full body of known facts doesn’t come remotely close to demonstrating the sort of state-level effort by Ukraine to interfere in our election that Russia actually did mount.

AD

That aside, this aspect of the report is a spectacular self own. It actually shows that for Trump, the view of Ukraine as corrupt was long hopelessly entangled with his theory that Ukraine tried to block him from winning in 2016.

AD

We know from careful reporting in The Post that this is exactly what shaped Trump’s views: In May, Trump was already privately ranting about Ukraine’s effort to “take me down,” and that this suffused his view of Ukraine as “corrupt.” Trump’s own former Homeland Security chief has said Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani regularly filled Trump’s head with this line of nonsense, agitating him.

Call it the narcissism defense: Trump genuinely persuaded himself that Ukraine had interfered in our election to harm him, which makes his concerns about undefined Ukrainian corruption legitimate. (Some Republicans are gravitating toward saying this crackpot theory is true, which is worse.)

AD

Trump had corrupt motives and still does

In the real world, the evidence that Trump didn’t care about generic corruption — and that he was advancing his own corrupt interests above all — is overwhelming. As early as May, Giuliani publicly announced his pressure campaign on Ukraine, explicitly saying Ukraine must investigate the 2016 Ukraine and Biden theories, and not because of generic corruption, but because this would be “very helpful” to Trump.

AD

The president himself told Zelensky on their July 25 call that Giuliani was acting at his direction in carrying out this whole scheme. On that call, Trump explicitly demanded those two investigations, not an investigation of generic corruption. Those released texts showed Giuliani, Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Ukrainian officials negotiating a statement announcing those investigations in particular.

AD

Sondland explicitly testified that the meeting was dangled to leverage those investigations, that he personally informed a top Zelensky aide that the military aid was also conditional on them and that he was acting at Trump’s direction all throughout.

We don’t even need to prove Trump himself explicitly drew that latter link. Trump’s extortion demands — and Sondland’s and Giuliani’s, carried out at Trump’s direction — are a matter of public record, and by themselves, they are deeply saturated in corrupt motives.

AD

After all, the investigation into the 2016 Ukraine theory stood to benefit Trump politically, because it would help absolve Russia of its own 2016 sabotage of our election for Trump — and make Trumpworld’s eager efforts to coordinate with and benefit from it disappear, making another round of it easier.

AD

The investigation into Biden, of course, stood to benefit Trump politically for more obvious reasons. Yet the GOP report claims concerns about Biden’s corruption were reasonable.

That’s nonsense on its face, but more to the point, it’s self-undermining. In both these cases, the GOP argument requires us to believe Trump was legitimately concerned with corruption, while also believing the two investigations he actually did demand both stood to benefit him politically only out of pure coincidence.

AD

It’s an awful argument. But if Republicans really want a debate about whether Trump was and is operating out of profoundly corrupt motives, it’s one Democrats should lean into hard.

Pete Buttigieg unveiled a proposal this morning to correct troubling health disparities among African Americans and Hispanics — a crucial constituency to win over to have any hope of securing the Democratic presidential nomination.

The South Bend, Ind., mayor's eight-page proposal pledged to even the playing field for minorities who typically have worse access to medical providers and much higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic health conditions compared with white Americans.

Buttigieg has surged in the polls to lead the Democratic primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. But he’s in trouble in subsequent primaries in Nevada and South Carolina, where strong support from African American voters has given former vice president Joe Biden a strong lead.

Buttigieg has been criticized for his handling of racially-charged incidents within his city’s police department and has only a smattering of endorsements from black or Hispanic elected officials. That could be a huge stumbling block for his campaign, considering no Democrat in the last three decades has secured the party's nomination without a majority of black support.

Even the Onion has mocked Buttigieg’s struggles:

Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote https://t.co/f0DQKE6XhZ pic.twitter.com/Q117k4MfZb — The Onion (@TheOnion) December 2, 2019

Buttigieg is hoping to help correct this problem with promises to make the health of minorities — both through direct medical care and indirect aspects such as housing, food, education and access to clean water — a top priority.

He promises that in his first 100 days as president his administration would develop a “National Health Equity Strategy.” He also vows to help particular geographic areas combat the worst disparities and to support programs to train the health-care workforce to overcome racial bias when treating patients.

The disparities are particularly stark when it comes to life expectancy. A black man living in a rural community is likely to live seven years less than a white man living in a city. Black life expectancy at birth is about three and a half years lower than that of whites. The mortality gap between black and white Americans been cut in half since 1999, but the United States still has a long way to go before it’s eliminated.

“Millions of Americans today still find their health determined by who they are or where they live,” the paper says. “Systemic discrimination takes the form of a doctor who takes a Black person’s pain symptoms less seriously … it manifests in a hospital system that breaks ground only in a predominantly white neighborhood.”

The paper also calls for improvements in black maternal health, an area that has recently undergone increased scrutiny as celebrities including Beyoncé and Serena Williams have spoken out about their own struggles with pregnancy and childbirth. Black women are three to four times as likely to be at risk of pregnancy-related deaths as white women, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

It’s hard to overstate Buttigieg’s need to inspire confidence among black voters in particular. They’re only a tiny sliver of the electorate in the earliest primary states, but they’re much larger voting blocs in nearly every primary that comes after. Minorities comprise more than one-third of Democratic voters in the 16 states with primaries on March 3, known as “Super Tuesday.”

For now, Buttigieg is focusing on South Carolina. He’ll meet with Latino community leaders and locals in Okatie, S.C., at noon today to discuss health equity, a spokeswoman said. On Sunday, the mayor attended services at a church led by the Rev. William J. Barber II, who revived a campaign originally started by Martin Luther King Jr. to combat economic inequality.

Afterward, Buttigieg told reporters that he believes he is making progress with black voters, including those “who may yet not feel that they know me,” per the Associated Press.

“Part of what I’m trying to do is talk about these issues, including specific racial issues around voter suppression and systemic racism, in a way that helps everyone in the country understand why we all have a stake in dealing with it,” Buttigieg said.

The campaign is opening four offices and hiring 40 staffers in the state. The campaign launched its first ad there yesterday, spending $2 million on a spot that features the mayor listening to a racially diverse group of voters.

The ad:

By releasing yet another health-care proposal among the many coming out of his campaign over the last few months, he seems to be adopting the sort of “plan for everything” style his opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was first known for.

One of his other proposals is “Medicare for all who want it,” which would retain employer-sponsored coverage while allowing anyone to buy a public plan if they preferred. The approach, which the mayor rolled out over the summer, is strikingly similar to the public option plan championed by Biden — so much so, that Biden accused Buttigieg yesterday of stealing his idea.

“[Buttigieg] doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderate — moderate plan,” Biden said in an interview with Politico. “It’s the Biden plan.”

My colleague Matt Viser:

Biden says Buttigieg stole his heath care plan — and the media isn’t tough enough on him for it.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

(Susan Walsh/AP)

AHH: Three state lawmakers published op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all that were written with the help of lobbyists that either wrote drafts or made extensive edits, our Washington Post colleague Jeff Stein reports, citing emailed obtained by The Post.

Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) said op-eds they wrote about single-payer health proposals included language from lobbyist and consultant John MacDonald. Meanwhile, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) told The Post the lawmaker published an op-ed with assistance from lobbyist Kathleen Deland.

“None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist,” Jeff writes. “The emails show how, even at the state and local levels, lobbyists are trying to bend public opinion away from an idea that has seized much of the debate during the current Democratic presidential primary. … The documents were provided to The Post by the nonprofit advocacy group Medicare for All Now, which supports the single-payer system. The group obtained the documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.”

Jeff adds that neither of the consultants would say whether they had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a group that’s spent more than $1 million on ads warning against Medicare-for-all and other overhauls to the nation’s health-care system. A spokesman for the group also wouldn’t confirm or deny having hired MacDonald or Deland.

OOF: The stigma of addiction and criminal activity related to opioid abuse remains a barrier for victims seeking damages, our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports, citing alleged victims, plaintiff lawyers and legal specialists.

“Prescription opioid abusers often are perceived to share the blame for the serious harm they experienced through addiction to prescription pills, recovering users contend,” he writes. “Unlike those injured by asbestos, medical implants or faulty automobile bags, courts have been reluctant to accept their claim that their addiction was the result of a dangerous, improperly marketed product.”

Christopher writes the settlement reached between OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and Oklahoma directed $200 million to the University of Oklahoma for a research and addiction treatment program, with another $12 million to local governments and $60 million for legal expenses.

“None of the settlement money was earmarked directly for victim compensation,” he writes. “Victim-compensation funds also have not yet been floated as part of the national-level settlements being negotiated by governments and manufacturers. The most tangible benefit for victims so far has been proposals for free anti-addiction and overdose-rescue drugs to individual communities.”

OUCH: About a fifth of adolescents ages 12 to 18 in the United States are now prediabetic, as are nearly a quarter of young adults ages 19 to 34, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The data found the rising rate of young people who are prediabetic, meaning their blood sugar levels are elevated but not quite high enough to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, means the age groups are at risk for developing the condition, CNN’s Michael Nedelman writes.

“Until recently, young children and teens almost never got type 2 diabetes, which is why it used to be called adult-onset diabetes,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Now, about one-third of American youth are overweight, a problem closely related to the increase in kids with type 2 diabetes, some as young as 10 years old.”

“Prediabetes was also more common among young people with obesity, which is also closely linked to Type 2 diabetes in adults. More than a quarter of obese adolescents and more than a third of obese young adults were found to have prediabetes — versus less than 17% of individuals with normal weight in both age groups,” Michael writes.

HEALTH ON THE HILL

— A bicameral group of Democrats have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that would require doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced the brief that includes 161 House Democrats and 36 Senate Democrats.

“Lawmakers said the case still represents a direct challenge to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, even though Louisiana and its supporters have not asked the Court to formally overturn Roe,” the Hill’s Nathaniel Weixel reports. “The Democrats said upholding Louisiana’s law would allow states to effectively eliminate abortion.”

“While Act 620 purports to improve women’s health and safety, the law will actually make it more difficult for women in Louisiana to obtain safe medical care,” the lawmakers wrote. “As with other statutes targeting abortion providers and facilities, the actual legislative intent here is to mandate requirements so difficult to fulfill that the inevitable outcome is the shuttering of abortion clinics and elimination of safe and legal abortions. Indeed, if Act 620 goes into effect, Louisiana will have only a single clinic providing abortion services in the entire state.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments for the case in March.

— Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) wants state lawmakers to work with her to halt the implementation of the state’s Medicaid work requirements amid concerns that people will lose health coverage, MLive.com’s Malachi Barrett reports.

“Starting next year, most able-bodied adults between the ages of 19-61 who are enrolled in Michigan’s Medicaid expansion will have to work an average of 20 hours per week or 80 hours per month,” Malachi writes. “Whitmer said pausing the ‘punitive’ requirements is the ‘most reasonable thing’ to prevent people from losing health care coverage.”

A coalition of state and national health groups last month filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop Michigan from implementing its work rules. Other legal challenges have been filed against work requirements in Kentucky, Arkansas and New Hampshire, as well as in Indiana, which said it would pause its requirements until the case is resolved.

Three of the four distinguished constitutional law professors appearing during today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing on impeachment were called by the majority Democrats, and unsurprisingly they agreed that the president’s behavior toward Ukraine, Congress, and his own Justice Department represented textbook grounds for impeachment. They expressed no real reservations about those conclusions.

Judiciary Republicans got to call one witness, and presumably they could not find a constitutional authority who shared the president’s often-repeated belief that he can do any damn thing he wants, or even one who was open to the conspiracy theories so many of them promote, or to their depiction of Trump as a brave patriot fighting corruption at home and abroad and suffering persecution for his virtue. But they found the next best thing: George Washington University’s Jonathan Turley, an outspokenly non-partisan and Trump-skeptic expert who nonetheless in every significant particular reinforced their claim that Trump’s being railroaded toward impeachment via a hasty partisan effort based on evidence falling far short of constitutional standards for removing a president.

In his opening remarks Turley made it clear he had voted against Donald Trump in 2016, and in defending him against impeachment he made a telling comparison of POTUS to Satan via a long account of St. Thomas More’s defense of giving the devil the benefit of the law from the fictional drama A Man for All Seasons. In both his prepared remarks and in answering questions he positioned himself as someone who deplored the partisan passions of the day, while sadly concluding that the impeachment effort — and the Republican battle against it — was just another example of a nation gone mad.

In other words, Turley was the perfect witness to appeal to self-styled political independents and putative 2020 swing voters who might approach this entire controversy with a plague-on-both-your-houses attitude. He wisely fell silent when Republican questioners retailed their own conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden or other nefarious Democrats.

Now if you read or listened to his words closely, it became apparent he differed from the other witnesses — and from the weight of opinion in constitutional law circles — not just on Trump’s impeachment but on all sort of fundamental issues. Unlike the others, he thinks presidents cannot obstruct Congress — or even obstruct justice — unless they defy judicial orders (unfortunately, federal judges typically refuse to police executive-legislative disputes, particularly those involving impeachment, as “political questions”). Unlike the others, he believes the constitutional standards for “bribery” track later criminal statutory definitions. And unlike the others, he would limit impeachments to situations where such criminal statutes are violated.

He also made it reasonably clear that he felt Bill Clinton was properly impeached, and that Andrew Johnson was “railroaded” much like Trump; Nixon, he feels, deserved impeachment but not on the obstruction of justice grounds that might provide a precedent for impeaching Trump. And above all, he stressed that legitimate and politically-sustainable impeachments require a lot of time (“saturation and maturation,” as he put it). As of this writing, he hasn’t addressed the question of how an alleged effort to rig an impending election can be addressed at the requisite leisurely pace, but Turley is clearly on board with the bedrock GOP argument that this impeachment proceeding is by definition illegitimate because it is happening so quickly.

So he is in an excellent position to give “non-partisan” credibility to the intensely partisan — by his own accounting — Republicans he is materially assisting. He reminds me a lot of David Brooks and other center-right pundits who profess disdain for partisans — equal disdain, regardless of the facts in any particular case — but who happen more often than not to come down on the side of whatever the GOP wants at any given moment.

Anyone seduced by Turley’s reasonable manner and apparent passion for fairness should reflect on the fact that he considers Andrew Johnson — the autocratic racist who tried to reverse the gains in human rights secured by the bloody sacrifices of the Civil War — a great victim of congressional abuse of power, and an appropriate role model for Trump as the object of an illegitimate impeachment inquiry. In his comparison of the 17th and 45th presidents he finally makes a point with which we can all agree.

But she was never able to persuade significant numbers of voters to support her.

AD

There are a number of reasons to which you could point to explain her difficulties. According to reports, her campaign was hampered by disorganization and mismanagement. Her fundraising couldn’t keep pace with that of other candidates such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She struggled with questions about her record as a prosecutor and her health-care plan (which was perfectly reasonable but didn’t slot neatly into the public option vs. Medicare-for-all conflict to which the debate is often reduced). It’s also hard to say whether her race and gender hurt her ability to amass support, and if so, how much.

One problem, though, stands out: As appealing as she may have been in many ways, Harris was never able to explain why she was running for president. It’s an answer you’d expect every candidate to know long before they make their announcement speech, but a surprising number of them don’t. The winner, though, almost always does.

Of course, we know that the real answer for every candidate, at least in part, is “I’m running for president because I want to be president.” If you think even highly ideological candidates such as Sanders aren’t fiercely ambitious, you’re fooling yourself.

AD

AD

But to stand the best chance at success, a presidential campaign has to be about something. Joe Biden is running to reset the clock to four years ago and restore civility and reason to our politics, his own version of “Make America Great Again.” Warren is running to end corruption and take power away from the plutocrats warping the system for their own ends. But why was Harris running? She never told us, at least not in a way that was clear and concise enough for voters to grasp.

To be clear, there are candidates still in the race who still haven’t told us. And as much as I hesitate to say they should pander to our ""10-second sound bite” culture, it’s not an unreasonable thing to demand that candidates should be able to communicate in a sentence or two what their candidacy represents. It’s particularly important during a primary when the policy distinctions between the candidates are relatively small compared with what they will be in the general election. Voters have to know who the candidates are, but they also have to know what voting for you says about them.

Like many, I’m sorry to see Harris leave the race (though she’ll be around for some time; she’s only 55). It’s particularly disconcerting that she was the only nonwhite candidate to have qualified for the next debate; an all-white debate is not exactly a good look for the party where most nonwhite voters reside.

And it’s not necessarily the CrowdStrike theory that has the strongest connection.

Between Oct. 24 and Nov. 4, we fielded an online survey of 1,206 American adults. The survey respondents were provided by Lucid and were weighted to approximate a nationally representative sample.

AD

AD

At the beginning of the survey, we posed the following question on impeachment:

Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have recently launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump. This is because he allegedly withheld American military aid to Ukraine to pressure its president to provide negative information about Joe Biden, a Democratic rival. What do you think of this?

The largest group (35 percent) said there is enough evidence to merit impeachment. An additional 14 percent agreed there is enough evidence for further inquiry. By contrast, 16 percent of Americans said Trump acted improperly but is not impeachable. Twenty-four percent said Trump did nothing wrong. Eleven percent said they didn’t know what to believe.

As other surveys have found, opinions are polarized along party lines. Sixty-nine percent of Democrats support outright impeachment, while only 5 percent of Republicans do. Meanwhile, 57 percent of Republicans think Trump did nothing wrong, compared with 2 percent of Democrats. Independents are more evenly divided, with 45 percent supporting impeachment or further inquiry, 41 percent preferring censure or exoneration, and 14 percent having no opinion.

But beyond partisanship, a second factor is related to impeachment opinions: support for conspiracy theories about the 2016 election.

AD

AD

In the same survey, we also asked two questions that posed a choice between a popular conspiracy theory, the official explanation, or neither option. The first question regarded Russian meddling in 2016:

Donald Trump won the 2016 election despite nearly all experts and polls predicting he would lose. This was because: 1) he was able to eke out narrow wins in states that Obama won like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; 2) the Russian government hacked into voting systems and rigged the election; 3) neither

Here, a majority pick the official explanation (56 percent), while 29 percent endorsed the conspiracy theory and 15 percent chose neither.

The second was a version of the “CrowdStrike” conspiracy theory that Trump himself asked the Ukrainians to investigate:

During the 2016 election, the story that Russia planted misleading Facebook ads and hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s emails was: 1) a fact established by the FBI and other federal intelligence agencies; 2) a story planted by CrowdStrike, a security company that was hiding Ukrainian efforts to aid the Clinton campaign; 3) neither

Most respondents (63 percent) chose the first option, while 26 percent endorsed the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory.

Impeachment views are strongly related to beliefs in these conspiracy theories. Among the 29 percent of Americans who believe Russia rigged the 2016 election, a whopping 80 percent believe Trump should be impeached and 11 percent think he should be investigated further. Almost no one in this group thinks Trump did nothing wrong.

AD

AD

By contrast, among the 26 percent of Americans who believe the “CrowdStrike” conspiracy theory, nearly 50 percent think Trump did nothing wrong and an additional 25 percent believe he was wrong but that the act was not an impeachable one.

Obviously, these results are influenced partly by partisanship: 52 percent of Democrats believe in the Russia conspiracy theory, compared with only 4 percent of Republicans; meanwhile, 51 percent of Republicans believe in the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory, compared with only 9 percent of Democrats.

But even if we take partisanship into account, people who believe in these conspiracy theories still have distinctive views of impeachment. For example, among Democrats who believe in the Russia conspiracy theory, 87 percent support outright impeachment; among Democrats who don’t believe, only 49 percent support impeachment.

For Republicans who believe in CrowdStrike, 67 percent think Trump did nothing wrong compared to 51 percent of Republicans who don’t believe in CrowdStrike.

Why are these conspiracy theories related to people’s views of impeachment? In our past research, we argue that conspiracy theories tap into another force that organizes American politics: people’s intuitions. Conspiracy theories are popular because they draw on the innate ways we make judgments and rationalize our biases.

AD

AD

For people who find Trump an unacceptable president, the Russian hacking conspiracy offers a compelling way to justify their feelings. Conversely, for Americans who see Trump as their champion, the CrowdStrike conspiracy is a bulwark against inconvenient evidence of Russian influence on Trump’s behavior.

This provides another reason the impeachment hearings have had little impact on public opinion about impeachment or Trump himself. Most Americans have an ample supply of intuitions and gut feelings that only buttress how they already feel about Trump. New evidence about Trump’s behavior, or misbehavior, is unlikely to have much sway.

In a Fact Checker column on Wednesday, The Post’s Glenn Kessler sought explanations from reps for Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) for assertions the lawmakers had made about certain events in Ukraine bearing on the ongoing impeachment proceedings. Graham’s office referred him to a relevant news account, though Kessler determined that it didn’t quite corroborate a Nov. 21 letter that Graham had sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

So Kessler renewed his efforts, pressing Nunes’s office on the matter, as well. An hour or two later, he got a call — from Solomon. ""Out of the blue we received a phone call from John Solomon, a former Washington Post reporter who apparently was the source for Republicans. He said two people from Capitol Hill had alerted him to our inquiry,” writes Kessler.

Which is to say, Solomon is now doing press for Republicans.

The Kessler fact-check is heavy on minutiae relating to a period in late 2015 and early 2016 when then-Vice President Joe Biden was pressuring Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to crack down on corruption, including a famous demand to fire Viktor Shokin, who was Ukraine’s prosecutor general at the time. A false narrative — in part enabled by Solomon’s reporting for the Hill — maintains that Biden lobbied for Shokin’s sacking to ease pressure on a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, that was paying the vice president’s son Hunter up to $50,000 a month to serve on its board. As Kessler points out, the truth lies in the opposite direction: Biden, his colleagues in the Obama administration and Western allies wanted Shokin out because he was weak on corruption.

The episode illustrates the overlap between Solomon’s reporting and Republican talking points. Graham’s letter to Pompeo asks for documents that might shed light on “allegations that Vice President Biden played a role in the termination of Prosecutor General Shokin in an effort to end the investigation of the company employing his son.” The request is premised upon these considerations, per Graham’s letter:

Compare that with Solomon’s timeline:

Notice the overlaps? Asked about the Solomon situation, Senate Judiciary Committee spokeswoman Taylor Reidy responded in an email that Graham is continuing to investigate what Hunter Biden “was doing on the board of a Ukrainian gas company,” considering his lack of experience in the energy sector. “As we investigate these troubling issues we will continue to follow and consult with a number of sources both inside and outside the government, including John Solomon’s reporting. We welcome others, including the media, to join in investigating these issues as well. For the most part, many media outlets have chosen to simply scoff at the troubling, unanswered questions of Ukraine corruption.”

We’ve also sought comment from Solomon and from Nunes’s office. We’ll update this post if we get a response.

Kessler awarded Four Pinocchios to both Graham and Nunes for their assertions about Biden’s phone calls and how they allegedly coincided with raids on the home of Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky in February 2016. In reality, notes Kessler, “nothing significant” happened in this time period, “except primarily the reinstatement of a previous court order.”

The episode shows the continued demand for Solomon’s work, even after his departure from the Hill and a career steeped in flimsy, debunked and tendentious stories. There’s demand on the Internet, there’s demand on Fox News and there’s demand among powerful GOP lawmakers. That’s all good news for Solomon’s next step: a media start-up that might just have some eager funders.

“What would you have done to me? Torn my ears off. Absolutely. I’d be a plagiarizing, no-good old man,” Biden told reporters, seeming to allude, in one sentence, to the plagiarism scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential bid and the nagging questions this time about his age.

The “No Malarkey” tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.

AD

AD

“I’m going to say something that I believe to be self-serving, and maybe it is,” Biden told voters in Emmetsburg, Iowa, on Monday. “In all those states we have to win, I do pretty well. . . . So, folks, I believe I can beat Donald Trump. I believe we will beat Donald Trump. I believe Donald Trump believes I will beat Donald Trump.”

Venting his anger

But the tour has also at times served as a bit of a release valve for weeks of seemingly pent-up frustration.

After stumbling in 1988, Biden endured another failed White House bid 20 years later when his 2008 candidacy was overshadowed by the electrifying primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And now Biden has been unable to put away opponents with shorter résumés and, in his view, a lesser chance of defeating Trump.

AD

On Monday, as Biden’s caravan traveled from a stop in northern Iowa to the airport, where he was jetting off for an evening of fundraising in New York before resuming the tour, he invited a group of reporters onto the bus for an unusually expansive conversation. At times, the exchange felt more like an airing of grievances, with Biden waving off staff members who noted he was going over the 30-minute agreed-upon time limit.

AD

“Look at the polling everywhere,” he said in response to a question about Warren. “Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself. She lives in Massachusetts. She’s advertising millions and millions in New Hampshire. Why shouldn’t she be known there?”

When it was pointed out that thousands of Warren supporters had come to see the senator recently in Chicago, he became incredulous.

AD

“Chicago. Oh, great, a great showing in Chicago. Look, guys, you always want to give me numbers but never want to apply numbers to them.”

He said the media’s bias toward Warren was evident as she shifted her stance on Medicare-for-all. Warren had embraced the single-payer plan trumpeted by Sanders. But last month, she pivoted to a more centrist idea: delaying the implementation of Medicare-for-all by three years. In the interim, health-care consumers could opt in to a government plan. But Biden said the media didn’t fully interrogate Warren about how much her initial Medicare-for-all plan would cost.

AD

“How many times did the press ask how much it will cost,” Biden said. “She never answered, because you kept talking about how she’s rising.”

AD

The electability argument

Biden said he felt he’d been fighting against another hurdle: the perception that he was too moderate for a Democratic Party that had become more liberal following Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016.

“What happened after Hillary. [People said,] ‘Guess what, man, the party has turned so far left. So far left, man. And you just can’t win, no one can possibly win, not in that lane.’ Now, and I was the one, remember all the debates in the beginning, ‘Biden is the moderate. Biden’s not progressive enough.’ ”

But now, he noted, other candidates have embraced a more moderate view on health care — adopting what he called the “Biden plan,” preserving the Affordable Care Act and giving the public an option to join a government program.

AD

AD

“I said it then, I’ll say it again, Medicare-for-all ain’t going anywhere, period, because there’s a thing called truth in getting there,” Biden said.

The “No Malarkey” theme, emblazoned in big white letters spread across Biden’s blue motor coach, comes from one of Biden’s favorite expressions. It’s another way of saying “straight talk,” which became the calling card for similar bus caravans that helped define the political brand of a longtime Biden friend, the late Republican Sen. John McCain.

The tour is an attempt to form connections with a larger swath of Iowans, particularly in rural areas, Biden said. It stretches through eight days and more than 660 miles.

AD

At times early on, Biden sounded hoarse or dabbed at his nose during a taxing long weekend of town halls and small-town pit stops. Staffers kept a glass of water tucked near any lectern where he was speaking. His speeches were short by Biden standards, around 20 minutes or so per stop, a move he said gave him ample time to talk with anyone who stayed after but also offered some respite for his vocal cords.

AD

Biden and his surrogates — he spent the first part of the tour traveling with former U.S. agriculture secretary and Iowa governor Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie — have argued that Biden is beating Trump head-to-head in battleground states that could decide the election. Iowa Democrats, they said, should consider those numbers when deciding which potential nominee could attract general election voters in key states.

“What about the people who aren’t as involved in politics? What about the independents? Who are they going to trust as well?” Christie Vilsack asked voters in Spencer on Sunday night. “The election is going to be won in the middle. And I want to make sure that I choose the person who’s most electable to the widest group of people.”

AD

Some voters who came to see Biden along the tour acknowledged a concern that a more liberal nominee seemed like a risky bet in the general election.

AD

“I hear a lot of people saying we need to take this . . . swat to the left, and I just don’t agree with that,” said Travis Halm, 29, of Council Bluffs, who came out to see the kickoff to Biden’s bus tour. “We can have a contest about who’s more liberal or who’s more progressive if we want, but it’s not going to do us any good if we’re sitting around sulking on November 4 after losing an election.”

Bob Seggerman, a registered Republican who voted for Trump and plans to do so again in 2020, got talked into coming to an event at a church-turned-restaurant in Spencer by some of his friends who are Democrats.

“I think [Biden has] got a softer appeal that’s more empathetic, and I like him more than the other Democrats,” he said. But, added Seggerman, who at 67 is a decade younger than Biden: “The only thing is, I look at the age of this man. A person who gets to be a certain age is ready to do just about anything but be president.”

AD

On the stump, Biden told voters that Trump’s America had failed middle-class and rural communities like the ones he was visiting on his bus tour. There were also lighter moments, like the widely mocked and memed image of Biden nibbling on his wife’s finger during her opening speech. Mostly, though, he stressed that he would bring a steady hand to the nation’s highest office and foreign policy, and that he’d put middle-class values first.

“I think we have to very deeply restore the backbone of this country, and by that I mean the middle class,” he said.

The tour underscored how Iowa remains vital to Biden’s hopes of winning the nomination. He has vowed to visit all 99 counties during the campaign, though even after the barnstorming trip, he will only have been to about a third. A weak showing in the Feb. 3 caucuses could affect his strength in two other early voting states — South Carolina, where he holds a big lead among that state’s large African American electorate, and Nevada, where he says he has strong Hispanic backing. If he survives there, another threat looms in early March, when the race turns to multiple big states in a Super Tuesday showdown where former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to make his stand.

'Still well in the game'

Biden, in his session with reporters, offered his analysis of the road ahead — all but conceding a potential Iowa defeat but insisting that he alone can rebuild the multiethnic coalition that propelled Obama.

“If I were to come in like some of the polling has shown, you know, like, five points behind, three points behind or seven points behind, I think I survive.” he said. “I think I do well, because of the depth of the support that I have in the African American [and] Latino community, and there’s not anybody so far that has risen to the point where they can all of a sudden everybody in the community can say, ‘Whoa. Wait a minute.’ Well, there is nobody else that’s in there that’s in a position to do what Barack was able to do."

Granted, it is a strange lineup for a party that is so dependent on nonwhite voters and, as the media keep telling us, has been trending far-left. The ascendancy of moderates is also reflected in Warren’s decline when she embraced the progressives’ Medicare-for-all plan. Sanders has a constituency that is loyal, limited and non-transferable. In short, right now we do not see enough staunch progressive voters to produce a plurality for any candidate. (The Warren-Sanders vote in national and early state polling cumulatively remains under 40 percent, although just barely in Nevada.) After all the hoopla about the party’s shift to the left, the three moderates might have the inside track for the nomination.

AD

AD

Despite an uneven performance and disproportionately negative coverage, Biden has kept a loyal base of supporters, including a significant plurality of African American voters, who have not been tempted to shift en masse to another candidate. If Biden can survive the first two primaries with comparatively few nonwhite voters, he will have a sizable advantage as states with higher percentages of nonwhite voters weigh in. The other candidates’ hopes rest with Biden’s unraveling in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden’s worst-case scenario would be a poor finish in both and a single opponent sweeping both.

Buttigieg’s path is straightforward: a top finish in Iowa and/or New Hampshire, the departure of one or more lagging candidates and then a one-on-one match-up against either a super-progressive or Biden. If it is the latter, however, African American voters might deprive him of the nomination.

Then there is Klobuchar, the emerging dark horse, if only because she has survived and gained stature by making it to the debate stage with better-known candidates. She successfully developed a solid ground game in Iowa and a feisty persona with a moderate message. She has to perform, as they say, “better than expected,"" in Iowa, which amounts to beating one or more of the top four contenders (Biden, Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg) and then slugging it out state by state. Her best hope comes in a race in which she becomes the last moderate standing.

It is worth noting that voters supporting a candidate who fails to get 15 percent in the first round in the Iowa caucuses are freed up to choose another candidate. The Iowa winner might turn out to be the second choice of the fifth-place candidate. (Yes, this is a heck of a way to pick a nominee.)

None of this means that Warren or Sanders, who have come down in the polls from their spring and summer highs, are out of it. However, as we know, once candidates’ poll numbers have dropped substantially (e.g., former congressman Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Kamala D. Harris), it is hard to get voters to reconsider them.

Between now and Feb. 3, when the voting starts in Iowa, a candidate can get hot, or stumble; an unexpected event (such as an impeachment trial) might throw a monkey wrench into the race. Anyone tempted to predict the outcome should consider just how many bits of conventional wisdom have evaporated upon contact with real voters. In other words, nobody will know much of anything until the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire speak.

News accounts documented tensions and confusing lines of authority in the campaign, which, when things are going poorly, often become the default explanations. (Those accounts, in turn, make fundraising difficult if not impossible.) However, these “dissension in the ranks” stories tend to be more a symptom than the cause of a campaign’s unwinding. In this case, it was a campaign for a candidate boxed in between far-left progressives and moderates, with no single policy objective to provide an organizing principle. She did suffer at times from a lack of focus, a fuzziness that some incorrectly attributed to excessive caution.

Looking for a single reason one candidate fails in a field of two dozen, the majority of the early dropouts being white men, is a favorite exercise of pundits, but an unsatisfying exercise. She failed to define her position on health care soon enough. She went back to the well attacking Biden one too many times in the second debate. She counted on Biden losing African American support early. There is a measure of truth to each rationale, but let me identify two overarching challenges that brought her down.

First, in large part due to media narratives, electability in this race centered around the mythical white working class male who voted for Donald Trump and feared immigrants but nevertheless might vote Democrat in 2020. The electable candidates were thus defined as white males, or at least white. The safe pick became synonymous with Biden, and the risky picks became progressives and/or people of color. An entirely different view of electability based on the success of women and minority candidates winning in 2018 could easily have been the story, but it was not. Harris thereafter became a higher-risk candidate, maybe the highest risk of all. In this, many in the pundit class bear a great deal of the blame for erecting a barrier for nonwhite and female candidates. Ultimately, it is up to a campaign to make its electability argument successful, but in Harris’s case she simply had a much higher hill to climb.

AD

AD

Harris’s second obstacle was that she has never run for office outside California. There, she is a mainstream Democrat, a strong crusader for gay rights and defender of immigrants, legal and otherwise. She is comfortable in her milieu and excels at the intra-Democratic politics in a state that essentially has only one major party.

California, of course, is not the totality of America. Especially in the early primary states, successful Democratic candidates must show they are as comfortable in and with the heartland, as accessible to small-town Iowans as to San Franciscans. The media does not get why Biden holds onto his voters or why a “no malarkey” tour may work in Iowa; they too often bring the coastal elite mind-set to a race that in the early going is decided by people who do not naturally embrace urban progressives. Harris never quite made the leap from San Francisco to Des Moines.

Harris, like most every first-time candidate, failed in her first presidential run. She is in good company. But her ability to relate to and excite nonwhites and women, her ability to reach voters former President Barack Obama carried but didn’t come out for Hillary Clinton, and her ability to deliver withering barbs at President Trump should put her on every candidate’s shortlist for vice president (whether she wants the spot on the ticket or not). A Biden-Harris ticket, with a one-term Biden presidency? A Buttigieg-Harris ticket? These seem hardly far-fetched.

One might reasonably ask why a political action committee trying to help a trailing candidate is going after the guy who’s currently in fourth place in national polls. Whatever the strategic calculation, there are a lot of people in the Democratic Party who resent Buttigieg’s (still modest) success and would like to see him taken down a peg or two.

AD

AD

Do they have a point?

The simplest answer is: Sure. Buttigieg is 37 years old. He’s the mayor of a city of approximately 100,000 people, which makes it the 306th largest city in the United States. On the most basic level, it’s ridiculous to think you could go from that job right to being president.

Booker isn’t the only one who has found Buttigieg’s success exasperating. Last month, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) argued that a female candidate of Buttigieg’s age and résumé would never be taken seriously. “Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,” she said of herself and the other female candidates. “Maybe we’re held to a different standard.”

AD

It’s difficult to argue with Klobuchar. In fact, it’s difficult to imagine a 37-year-old female mayor of a mid-size city even considering a run for governor, let alone president. Buttigieg has benefited from a particular kind of bias shared by the media and many voters: When we think “president,” we imagine a white guy, and so even an extremely young white guy seems plausible enough to take seriously.

AD

In all likelihood, Buttigieg decided to run for president because there were no more proximate rungs on his ladder. He can’t run for Congress because his district is heavily Republican. (In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by 23 points). Becoming governor of Indiana is similarly unlikely. And, these days, even an unsuccessful run for president can give your career a boost; heck, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson wound up with a Cabinet position in an area he had never spent even a moment contemplating.

And Buttigieg is unquestionably talented. He may not be Barack Obama, but he’s smart, articulate and personable. If you like former vice president Joe Biden’s ideological and political approach, but would prefer someone less than half his age, Buttigieg is your guy.

AD

Experience isn’t everything, of course; there have been good and bad presidents who brought experience to the job. But being a successful president does require a unique combination of knowledge, character, vision and temperament. They have to wrangle Congress to pass a legislative agenda, manage the world’s largest organization with more than 4 million employees and a budget of more than $4 trillion, navigate complex relationships with other countries, and deal with natural and human-caused crises.

AD

If nothing else, it’s easier for voters to determine whether someone can do all those things when they can look at what that person did in jobs of increasing responsibility that dealt with the types of domestic and foreign issues a president is responsible for. Since there’s no other job quite like that of president, voters will always be guessing at how a person might perform, but at least the candidate’s history can provide some clues. With Buttigieg, there really isn’t that much to go on.

It’s not all that surprising that Buttigieg would be the target of ire (spoken or otherwise) from some of his opponents. Every candidate who isn’t winning will inevitably believe there’s something unjust at work in a race that isn’t rewarding them for the fact that, in their own minds, they’re the obvious choice. To run for president, you need an enormous ego and tons of self-confidence, so all of them probably feel that if voters would just listen, they’d be in the lead — or at the very least where Buttigieg is, not leading but in a position to get there.

AD

But Buttigieg is particularly likely to frustrate other candidates. If you’re behind Biden you can say, okay, that makes some sense: He’s been around forever, he was vice president, he’s obviously qualified. You might look at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and say, I get it, he’s got a base of support on the left that won’t desert him no matter what. But a pipsqueak like Buttigieg? What’s he got that I haven’t got?

AD

In the end, the answer may be: Not enough, at least not this time around (after all, he could run 10 more times before he’s too old). But if he keeps gaining strength, other candidates both above and below will be only too eager to try to take him out.

And we need to grapple with the implications of this alliance with what you might call “Putinism” in a way that doesn’t treat it as a fleetingly useful political tactic, but rather as something with serious real-world consequences.

AD

The problem with the ‘dupe’ formulation

The occasion for this reevaluation is the devastating new House Intelligence Committee report detailing Trump’s extortion plot toward Ukraine and the Judiciary Committee’s consideration this week of whether Trump committed impeachable offenses.

On one level, the problem with the “Trump as Russian dupe” formulation is that it implicitly but dramatically downplays the severity of Trump’s corruption and the threat it poses to the country.

AD

The new House report vividly dramatizes why Trump undertook his corrupt plot to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do his political bidding and what that says about Trump’s intentions toward our government and democracy going forward.

For Trump, the utility of getting Zelensky to announce an investigation validating the lie that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in 2016 wasn’t simply that it would salve his bruised ego over his need for Russian help to win.

AD

This false narrative would also help Trump confuse the U.S. electorate with disinformation obscuring his own corrupt efforts to coordinate with and benefit from that sabotage of our political system. This in turn could facilitate benefiting from the next round of such sabotage, which he has openly invited.

AD

In short, the report demonstrates that Trump’s profiting off Russian sabotage last time, and his efforts to extort Ukraine into helping him again, are the same story — one that will continue.

Trump was emboldened by getting away with the first installment, and when the second installment was unmasked, Trump blithely said in reporters’ faces that Ukraine — and China — absolutely should launch an investigation of potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden, his other extortive demand.

On top of this, the report demonstrates how numerous cabinet officials and extensive government resources — and the conditioning of multiple official acts — were placed at the disposal of the whole corrupt scheme.

AD

AD

Taken together, the report concludes, this “presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office” to corrupt the next election on his own behalf, and that in so doing, Trump recognizes no legitimate “limitation.""

We now know that the lie about Ukrainian interference has been a mainstay of self-absolving Russian propaganda for years. But Trump hasn’t been duped into spreading it. He explicitly recognizes an alliance of his own interests with those of Russia in doing so (and in procuring whatever other outside help he can) in corrupting U.S. liberal democracy for his own malevolent self-interested purposes.

This has implications for impeachment. As Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman will argue to the Judiciary Committee, impeachment binds the president to the rule of law, as a remedy against abuses of power to advance nakedly corrupt self interest.

AD

AD

Which leads to the bigger point.

This has broader consequences

The Post reports that much of the GOP has now adopted the false narrative about Ukraine, in league with Trump. But many quoted ask too narrow a question: Whether this means the GOP is dropping its previously “hawkish” posture toward Russia.

It’s worth asking whether something more consequential is happening.

A broader approach was suggested to me by foreign policy scholar David Rothkopf, who argues that we should think about “Putinism” as a “worldwide movement” that allies various ethno-nationalist and illiberal authoritarian leaders against Western liberal democracy, the rule of law, international institutions and the commitment to empiricism in the face of disinformation.

AD

“Trump, his administration and the GOP have made a conscious choice to align themselves with Putinism,” Rothkopf told me. “It is not unwitting.”

AD

It’s not easy to say how committed Trump is to these tendencies. He yearns to operate more fully as other illiberal authoritarians do. But for all his bluster about our current alliances, it’s unclear how much damage he will do to them in the long run.

Still, it’s obvious that Trump — and, increasingly, many of his GOP defenders — are to some untold degree operating in sync with Putinism and are acting against the interests of our liberal democracy.

This also has ramifications for Democrats. The Post piece reports that some strategists “see a possible opening” for the eventual nominee to win over “hawkish Republicans and independents who are wary of the Republican drift on Russia.”

AD

But Democrats need to go bigger. As Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg suggested to me, party leaders must argue that the GOP’s “embrace of the Ukraine fiction” is not merely a matter of domestic political expediency. Rather, it’s time to ask whether we’re seeing the beginnings of a “realignment” with this global right wing movement against the values and even the interests of “the United States and the West.”

AD

“Democrats must step up here and explain to the country the gravity of the moment,” Rosenberg says.

Trump’s degradations have forced us to grapple with the correct language to describe the moment in all kinds of ways. It’s time to do away with the “dupe” formulation as well.

But while most of those who’ve dropped out over the course of the year were white men (including two already this week), Harris was both the best-polling nonwhite candidate and, for a brief moment this summer, someone who looked as if she might ascend to the top tier of the crowded field. That surge, following the first debate, soon faded, and Harris never regained her momentum.

There have been 27 major or major-adjacent candidates who’ve declared at some point. Fifteen of them remain, including the recent additions of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.

The debate criteria introduced by the Democratic Party have been effective at winnowing the field. While many of those still in the race haven’t been making the cut for recent debates, many of those who dropped out did so after failing to earn a debate slot.

But compare where we are now with what the field looked like on Valentine’s Day. At that point, most of those who had declared were women, black or Hispanic. Most of them are still in the race, even with Harris’s departure.

Now compare that with what the field looks like after Harris left.

Pay particular attention to that December debate column. It shows the six candidates who’ve earned a slot, all of whom are white. Harris had earned a slot but obviously won’t be participating following her departure from the race.

AD

AD

Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. Its strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.

It’s important to recognize, though, that this assessment of the collapse of diversity in the field overlooks two important factors.

The first is that we’re really only talking about racial and ethnic diversity. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will appear in December, as will candidates who would become the first Jewish (Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders) or openly gay (South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg) presidents in U.S. history.

AD

AD

The second is that one reason that the field is narrowing to mostly white candidates is Democratic voters overwhelmingly support white candidates. The Post’s most recent primary poll, conducted with ABC News, showed that white candidates earned more than 80 percent of all support from Democratic primary voters, driven by the two-thirds eaten up by former vice president Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders. White men got just under 60 percent of all support.

Among nonwhite voters, white men got more support than among Democratic voters overall, albeit so slightly that the difference isn’t statistically significant. Even that is noteworthy, though: White and nonwhite voters support white and nonwhite candidates about equally.

At least when considered in demographic groups. Biden fares much better with black primary voters than do other candidates, one central reason he continues to lead the field.

AD

AD

As CNN’s Ronald Brownstein has noted, no candidate has been able to cobble together a coalition like the one enjoyed by Barack Obama in 2008. Biden’s doing well with black voters, Warren and Buttigieg are jostling for college-educated whites, and Sanders is performing well with younger voters. A broad split — but, again, all white.

As is often the case in American politics in 2019, President Trump plays a role here. Defeating Trump continues to be a primary motivation for Democratic primary voters, and white Democratic candidates continue to be seen — however justifiably — as the candidates with the best chance of winning in 2020. In our November poll, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the candidates most capable of beating Trump.

Perceptions of electability can change quickly. It did for Harris after her first debate performance, and it has for other candidates in the past. So far this year, though, Biden’s edge on electability has been consistent, even as electability has become a central concern of voters. That has been an ongoing problem for his opponents.

The other problem, of course, is that you have to be a candidate to benefit from a sudden surge in views of your electability. With a field winnowing down to largely white candidates, the odds that the Democratic nominee isn’t white necessarily drop significantly.

It is more accurately, outside the law and constitution, and a violation of his oath of office.”

The Republicans’ 123-page report asserts that Trump “has a deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption” and aversion to foreign aid, and that public criticism by Ukrainian officials justified his suspicion. The defense is ludicrous for a batch of reasons.

First, for a guy so concerned about corruption, he never mentioned it. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe observes, “Trump never raised a concern with corruption as such on any call with [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky or anyone else.” The Obama administration was interested in fighting corruption and deployed Biden to, for example, pressure Ukraine to oust a corrupt prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Trump thought this was awful and wanted to investigate Biden for doing this.

Second, what Trump did raise in his call with Zelensky was the “Bidens” and the ludicrous CrowdStrike conspiracy. “The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.” Trump infamously told Zelensky, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it.” None of this has to do with rooting out corruption.

AD

AD

Third, if Trump was so concerned about corruption, why release aid in September when the plot was uncovered? One would think his deep-seated concern about Ukrainian corruption would not have been alleviated with no additional intervening action on anti-corruption measures.

Fourth, if anti-corruption was his obsession, why did Trump want a public announcement specifically mentioning the Bidens? Trump wanted the PR value of headlines blaring “Ukraine investigating Biden,” but he showed no interest in doing any actual investigation. He never, for example, tasked the attorney general with investigating the matter.

Fifth, as attorney Maya Wiley noted, Trump never bothered to correct or contradict Giuliani in May when he publicly promised to goad Ukraine into conducting probes “very, very helpful” to Trump.

AD

AD

Sixth, if Trump was conducting a serious investigation of corruption, why deny there was a “quid pro quo” — that is, investigations in exchange for release of aid. Instead, he should have declared, “Darn right I’m not giving those people a penny!”

Seventh, the role of Giuliani makes no sense if this was about fighting corruption. He had a skilled anti-corruption fighter in Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump fired at the behest of Giuliani and his cronies. Former prosecutor Harry Litman tweeted that there was “no possible reason to have Rudy running the show of course, much less fire Yovanovitch. The normal career and political officials can and do fight corruption just fine--that’s their main lookout in fact and they all made clear Trump subverted it.”

Eighth, as my colleague Aaron Blake points out, the excuse that Trump was seeking a “thoughtful review” of corruption before meeting with Zelensky is inane. “There already was a ‘thoughtful review’ of Ukraine’s anti-corruption measures, and Ukraine passed it. It came from the Defense Department, which concluded in May that Ukraine had made sufficient progress on corruption to merit the aid.”

AD

AD

Ninth, for a guy so interested in fighting corruption, he’s made a practice of cavorting with some of the most corrupt authoritarians on the planet — Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Tribe puts it, Trump, “to tell the truth, has never evidenced any such concern in his entire life — whether with Ukraine or with any other government — apart from his manifestly phony comments about ‘draining the swamp’ that he has done more than anybody else to fill.”

Tenth, if the explanation for all of this is entirely innocent, why would former national security adviser John Bolton have characterized the Giuliani-Mick Mulvaney activities as a “drug deal” and told his subordinates to inform the lawyers, and why would the lawyers not have explained to those raising concerns — such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman — that the holdup was entirely appropriate (rather than instructing him to tell no one about it)?

Eleventh, there is no reason to withhold documents or to prevent witnesses such as acting chief of staff Mulvaney or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from testifying if the explanation, supported by documents, shows Trump’s determination to fight corruption. Surely there would be documented evidence of Trump’s “genuine” concern for stopping corruption, right?

AD

AD

Twelfth, Trump should be dying to participate in the impeachment hearings if he had a valid reason for strong-arming Ukraine. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) commented, “If the President thinks the call was ‘perfect’ and there is nothing to hide … [he would] provide any exculpatory information that refutes the overwhelming evidence of his abuse of power.” Instead, Trump is bent on undermining the process and encourages his helpmates in the House to raise one bogus conspiracy theory after another.

C’mon, who are Republicans kidding? Saying Trump is concerned about corruption is about as believable as saying he is concerned about his own conflicts of interest or nepotism. If this is the best Republicans can come up with, there really is no factual or constitutional defense for Trump.

Federal regulators are requiring Oregon to ensure its child welfare workers don’t discriminate against parents with disabilities, after the state lost its bid to take away the children of a low-IQ couple in a high-profile court battle.

This morning, the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services will announce an agreement with Oregon for the state to develop a system for ensuring its employees comply with federal law banning discrimination based on someone’s disability, whether it's physical or intellectual. Over the next two years, the state must set up training programs, provide OCR with written reports and review 10 specific cases to determine whether it acted appropriately, among other steps.

“We do commend Oregon for doing the right thing of looking hard at their policies and doing what they can to put safeguards in place so nobody falls through the cracks and ends up losing custody of their children,” OCR Director Roger Severino told The Health 202 in an interview yesterday.

Severino said the investigation into Oregon was prompted by the case of Amy Fabbrini and Eric Ziegler — a couple with below-average scores on an IQ test who lost custody shortly after both their children were born.

The couple’s IQ scores were low enough for them to have borderline mental disabilities — Fabbrini’s score was 72, while Ziegler’s was 66 — but both had graduated from high school and had taken parenting, nutrition and CPR classes to try to show their ability to care for their boys.

Yet the children were put in foster care over concerns the parents weren’t able to create a safe environment and were only returned after courts ordered it, when the boys were 4 years old and 10 months old. Deschutes County Judge Bethany Flint ruled in January 2018 that there wasn’t enough evidence to show Fabbrini and Ziegler couldn’t safely parent.

“The default presumption should be children stay with their parents and a person having an intellectual disability should not automatically change that presumption,” Severino told me.

Inside Edition did a story on the family:

Severino said his office reviewed Oregon’s compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws and found “systemic” issues with how the state follows federal law to prevent discrimination against parents with disabilities in Oregon’s child welfare system.

But OCR hasn’t reached an official conclusion on whether the state violated the laws. That’s because Oregon has agreed to undergo a self-examination process — a common way for entities to avoid being slapped with a finding of violation and potential loss of federal dollars.

""The Oregon Department of Human Services believes that all children and their families should be safe, healthy, and treated with equity and respect,” Fariborz Pakseresht, director of the state's Department of Human Services, said in a statement. “We appreciate...the assistance of the Office of Civil Rights in helping identify areas for practice improvements to ensure that all families receive the supports and services that meet their individual needs.""

Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

Oregon previously said its workers didn’t remove Fabbrini and Ziegler’s children from them solely based on their IQ scores — although the couple insisted that was the primary reason.

But requiring parents to take IQ tests as even a partial determination of whether they should be allowed to keep their kids is controversial among some advocates, who say it’s an unfair way of determining who is fit to parent.

“IQs test for problem-solving and short-term memory, basically which all goes out the window when a parent is under stress,” said Sherrene Hagenbach, who advocated on behalf of Fabbrini and Ziegler amid their court battle.

Hagenbach, who said she is also working with a deaf couple and an autistic father whose children were taken from them in Oregon, is the person who first alerted OCR to Fabbrini and Ziegler’s story back in fall 2018 and asked the department to investigate.

She’s glad to see the state launching a review but questions how much it will fix what she views as a systemic problem that is nationwide.

“I’m super excited to know they are able to review that case because it’s horrific on all levels,” she said. “I’m not sure this is gonna fix anything, but at least it’s a step in the right direction.”

AHH: The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted 18 to 5 to approve the nomination of Texas radiation oncologist Stephen Hahn to be the new Food and Drug Administration commissioner -- but the panel's leading Democrat voted against him, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.

“Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said before the vote that Hahn is ‘exactly the type of nominee’ that should lead the FDA, citing his management and research experience,” she writes. “But Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the panel’s ranking Democrat, voted against Hahn, saying during his confirmation hearing last month he had ‘refused to commit to implementing a strong policy to clear nontobacco e-cigarettes’ from the market — a step President Trump promised in September but has not finalized. Other Democrats split, with some voting for Hahn’s confirmation and others voting against him.”

Dozens of medical, patient and research groups this week pushed to quickly confirm Hahn, even as other groups, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said he shouldn’t be confirmed to the post until the Trump moves forward on its vaping policy.

OOF: The Trump administration released details of a new program to provide free HIV prevention medication to uninsured individuals. The program — called “Ready, Set, PrEP” — will provide drugs from drugmaker Gilead Sciences to reduce the number of HIV infections a year in the country by 90 percent by 2030.

The government also reported yesterday that just 40 percent of adults in the United States have ever been tested for HIV, and fewer than a fifth of people at high risk of developing the infection get the preventive medication, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.

“Dramatic improvement of testing and prevention, as well as better treatment of people who already have HIV, are urgently needed if the government is to reach President Trump’s goal of virtually wiping out transmission of the infection by 2030, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said,” he writes. “The announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar expands government efforts to provide the highly effective medication to more people at risk of contracting HIV, including African American and Latino men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, people with mental illness and the homeless.”

Azar said about 200,000 uninsured individuals could get the free drug once they’ve tested negative for HIV and get a prescription. Three major pharmacy chains — CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Rite Aid — will be part of the program and will distribute the medication starting in March.

OUCH: Pete Buttigieg responded to the remarks from Democratic rival Joe Biden that the South Bend, Ind., mayor “stole” the former vice president’s health-care plan.

“Well, first of all, I’ve been talking about ‘Medicare for all who want it’ since at least February, and also the plans are not exactly the same,” Buttigieg said in an interview with CNN. “… Of course, I believe that our approach on health care is the best one, and I’m willing to bring that plan out and compete with any of my competitors on having the best plan.”

Biden said on the campaign trail this week that Buttigieg “doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderate — moderate plan. It’s the Biden plan.” “The former vice president then accused the media of going too easy on Buttigieg, saying his opponent had once supported a more liberal health care plan but then pivoted,” Politico’s Natasha Korecki reported. “Biden contended that if he had supported a different plan ‘and then I came along with the exact same plan, what would you have done to me? You would have torn my ears off. Absolutely, I would be a plagiarizing, no good, old man who did bum bum bum.’ ”

— The House Oversight subcommittee on economic and consumer policy will hold a hearing today to examine the federal response to the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use.

The hearing follows recent reports that the Trump administration appears to be reversing course on a pledged ban on most flavored e-cigarettes.

“In a recent meeting with health groups, vaping advocates and tobacco executives at the White House, Trump expressed concern that a flavor ban could result in an increase in counterfeit products,” Laurie reports. “In a letter Monday, 28 members of Congress asked Trump to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market until they are cleared by the FDA. Vaping advocates have argued that a flavor ban would hurt adults using e-cigarettes to quit smoking and that youth use should be reduced in other ways, such as by restricting where the products are sold.”

— Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are calling on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Federal Trade Commission and five major health-care companies to provide information about how they are addressing bias in algorithms used in their systems.

A study published in the journal Science in October found a widely used algorithm meant to predict patient needs underestimated the health needs of the sickest black patients, as our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reported then.

“In using algorithms, organizations often attempt to remove human flaws and biases from the process,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and top executives of UnitedHealth Group, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, Humana and Aetna. “Unfortunately, both the people who design these complex systems, and the massive sets of data that are used, have many historical and human biases built in. Without very careful consideration, the algorithms they subsequently create can further perpetuate those very biases. Health care systems are not immune to the problem of bias.”

— A little-known group, the Pharmaceutical Industry-Labor Management Association, is working to oppose drug-pricing proposals across the country, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) bill to address drug costs.

The coalition includes major pharmaceutical companies and construction industry unions whose members build pharmaceutical plants and research facilities, the New York Times’s Katie Thomas reports. The group has put its money in ads on Facebook, print ads in local publications and mailers out to voters in Democratic districts to defeat such proposals on the state and federal levels.

Their message “aligns closely with the talking points of drug companies, which claim that Ms. Pelosi’s bill would stifle innovation and damage a vital American industry,” Katie writes. “Even in the nation’s capital, where coalitions and dark-money groups are routinely used to repackage corporate interests in a more sympathetic light, the pairing of the drug industry and unions is an unusual one. Many unions, including some who are members of Pilma, help oversee their workers’ health plans and have an interest in lowering drug costs. And out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs are a financial strain on many Americans, including union members.”

President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign. The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.

Those facts have yet to be contradicted. We have Trump’s own words on the July 25 rough transcript (“do us a favor though”), diplomat David Holmes’s account of the president pressing Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about “investigations,"" the hold on nearly $400 million in aid, Trump’s public statements inviting China and Ukraine to weigh into the election and the testimony of multiple career civil services that Trump outsourced his scheme primarily to Rudolph W. Giuliani, who publicly bragged that he was talking about Biden with Ukrainians.

AD

AD

What is new are the call records showing ongoing communications between Giuliani and the Office of Management and Budget (which ordered the hold on aid) and, stunningly, between the ranking Republican member of the Intelligence Committee (and conspiracy monger) Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.) and indicted Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. Nunes therefore becomes a fact witness, and his efforts to disrupt the hearings and toss out one red herring after another begin to reek of self-interested obstruction of the committees work.

Constitutional scholar Laurence H. Tribe comments, “The evidence of those suspicious Giuliani phone calls with [Vladimir] Putin-linked thugs reinforces the overwhelming case that the American president was directing a criminal conspiracy to conscript US military aid and the august powers of his office to benefit himself and his own reelection at the expense of the national security.” He adds, “If this isn’t impeachable and removable conduct, we’re done as a constitutional republic.”

The report also makes clear that Trump’s scheme “was undertaken with the knowledge and approval of senior Administration officials, including the President’s Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.” The report reminds us, “In fact, at a press conference weeks after public revelations about the scheme, Mr. Mulvaney publicly acknowledged that the President directly tied the hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation, telling Americans to ‘get over it.’”

Aside from the near-airtight factual case against Trump for having engaged in what amounts to bribery and extortion for political gain, the report makes crystal clear the necessity of obtaining testimony from other witnesses. “The call records the committee obtained make clear there is a treasure trove of evidence lying just beyond their grasp,” says former Justice Department spokesman Matt Miller. “Had the White House not obstructed this investigation, they could have obtained testimony about what these people discussed and almost certainly produced even more damning evidence than they already have.” Miller adds, “It also seems to show that Nunes was in the middle of this plot from the beginning, which might explain why he was so mad throughout the hearings.”

For starters, Nunes needs to appear and provide testimony under oath. None of his calls or actions implicate any privilege; he is not immune from subpoenas as a fact witness. Moreover, given the direct communication with the OMB, its senior political appointees must appear and answer questions about their contacts with Giuliani.

Moreover, in view of the conclusion that senior officials knew of the scheme, their testimony becomes all the more vital. As luck would have it, a federal district court just denied a stay on the order former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit just affirmed a lower-court ruling that Deutsche Bank and Capital One must turn over financial records to the House. Both obliterate Trump’s claims of “absolute immunity."" The report underscores that it is worth a brief pause to pursue witnesses hiding behind bogus immunity claims. The courts now seem to be moving with speed, providing some chance that vital witnesses could be corralled.

“There’s a real difference in hearing the story witness by witness and seeing it all laid out on a timeline,” observes former prosecutor Joyce White Vance. “It’s like watching the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. As Schiff says, the country now has to decide whether what happened is impeachable or whether the country has to ‘get over it’ as Trump’s chief of staff said, and let presidents use the power of their office to cheat in elections.”

The Intelligence Committee’s report is a triumph of clarity and thoroughness. Now to make the best possible case, the House should press to hear from newly revealed witnesses who have knowledge of Trump’s action and potentially participated in wrongdoing. If current Cabinet members such as Pompeo do not appear, the House should consider impeaching them as well. The stonewalling must end.

What’s happening now: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has asked committee chairs to proceed with articles of impeachment – meaning they will write a list of what they see as impeachable offenses by the president.

What happens next: Those articles will be voted on, one by one, by the House Judiciary Committee and then the full House. Pelosi gave no indication of a timeline, nor did she say how narrowly crafted the articles of impeachment would be. The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet Monday for presentations on Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine from lawyers for the Intelligence Committee. Here’s a guide to how impeachment works.

How we got here: A whistleblower complaint led Pelosi to announce the beginning of an official inquiry on Sept. 24. Closed-door hearings and subpoenaed documents related to the president’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky followed. After two weeks of public hearings in November, the House Intelligence Committee wrote a report that was sent to the House Judiciary Committee.

Despite having viral, breakout moments during the Senate’s investigation of Russia’s interference into the 2016 presidential election, Harris remained largely unknown to many Americans before launching her campaign — even among the groups many people thought would propel her. Her campaign was a reminder that being well known in Washington and political circles is not the same thing as having national recognition. While some more established liberal candidates were working to convince voters that they were best positioned to undo President Trump’s political decisions, Harris was in many ways still introducing herself. And that put the junior senator at a bit of a disadvantage — even with black women, one of the Democratic Party’s most influential voting blocs.

Some of Trump’s strongest criticism comes from black women — a group that votes against the GOP at higher rates than most. But while many black women long for representation at the highest level of government, some voters questioned whether a black woman could attract the broad support needed to defeat Trump. This concern, along with former vice president Joe Biden’s long history with black voters, is part of what sent Biden flying past Harris in polls with black voters shortly after launching his campaign.

Danielle Moodie-Mills, host of the radio show “WokeAF,” said last week that Biden, who enjoys widespread name recognition, is a safe bet with many black voters.

“You have older black voters who are definitely on his side because they are looking to see where are the white voters who voted for Donald Trump going to go,” she said on MSNBC. “We understand what oppression and discrimination looks like on a regular basis, and we understand Donald Trump to be a lethal threat to our way of life. And so we are going to go … the way that seems the safest.”

There were also questions about Harris among some of those groups she sought to win. Her history as a prosecutor — and her role in advocating for tough sentences for people of color — forced her to answer questions that voters looking for a candidate committed to criminal justice reform repeatedly asked. And some black Americans questioned whether the daughter of a Jamaican immigrant raised by an Indian woman could respond to the issues affecting black Americans calling on the United States to reexamine the ongoing impact of slavery on racial gaps.

In her announcement ending her campaign, Harris pointed toward fundraising being the biggest obstacle that kept her from moving forward.

AD

“My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,” she wrote. “… And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.”

Harris noted that she was not able to self-fund her campaign like some of the billionaire candidates, but she does have more money than some of her competitors — in fact, enough to qualify for the December debate, something not all of her competitors have done.

With Harris’s exit, the stage for December’s Democratic debate primarily consists of white candidates and older candidates during a time when the left’s constituency is younger and more ethnically diverse. Despite this shift, long-standing perceptions of leadership remain among some voters.

AD

Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, a political action committee that helps black women get elected to office, previously told The Fix that black women seeking office often have a harder time than white men in getting people to get behind their campaign.

AD

“I think a lot of it has to do with our perception of what leadership looks like. For umpteen years, the majority of elected leaders have been white and male,” she said. “You come and counter that with a woman — and a woman of color, and a black woman at that — seeking the highest office in the land, it’s something out of the norm.”

Regular frustrations with conversations about electability led Harris’s defenders to argue that she was the candidate most prepared to defeat Trump. But for those who were hoping Harris would break the glass ceiling that 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton could not, 2020 was simply not Harris’s time. And as cliched as it sounds, in politics, timing is often everything.

While the report does not outline the specific articles of impeachment the president could face in the House, it signals that Democrats are at least preparing to accuse of him of obstructing Congress, finding that a dozen witnesses “followed President Trump’s orders, defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify.”

The House Judiciary Committee is charged with drafting the articles and will hold its first impeachment hearing Wednesday, with constitutional scholars set to testify. The rapid timeline puts the House on pace to impeach Trump by Christmas. The fight will then move to the Senate, where the White House and its allies believe that the president will be acquitted by the Republican-controlled chamber.

At the heart of Democrats’ case is their allegation that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine in the face of Russian military aggression, to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

AD

AD

Trump has repeatedly said he did nothing wrong and has derided the impeachment inquiry as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.”

“I think it’s a disgrace. I think the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in London, where he is attending a NATO meeting. “If you look at impeachment, the word ‘impeachment,’ here there was nothing wrong, nothing done wrong.”

Democrats’ findings are primarily drawn from the testimony of witnesses who appeared before the Intelligence Committee last month, as well as the rough transcript of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky released by the White House, in which Trump asks the Ukrainian leader to “do us a favor though” with regard to the investigations.

AD

But the report also includes records showing that Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who orchestrated the pressure campaign against Ukraine, made phone calls to the White House and its budget office during key moments of the investigation.

AD

The records show he called the White House repeatedly on April 24, the day then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was summoned to Washington and removed from her post in Kyiv. Giuliani publicly alleged that she was anti-Trump, although Yovanovitch’s colleagues, including senior State Department officials, have defended her as an exemplary public servant.

Giuliani called the White House at least seven times on April 24 between 7:47 a.m. and 8:09 p.m. He also received a call from a White House number and spent more than eight minutes speaking to someone identified only as “-1” in the report.

AD

The records do not provide any details about the nature of the calls or whether Giuliani spoke with Trump. On Twitter and in television appearances that day, Giuliani promoted the debunked theory, embraced by the president, about alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

AD

In a news conference Tuesday, Schiff declined to say how his committee obtained the phone records but said they showed “considerable coordination” among key figures, including the White House, in the campaign to oust Yovanovitch.

The report also details calls that Giuliani made in August to people whose phone numbers are associated with the White House Office of Management and Budget, at a time when an Oval Office meeting for Zelensky was being sought and Trump had placed a hold on the military aid for Ukraine.

AD

And the report reveals new contacts between the Intelligence Committee’s ranking Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), and Giuliani, as well as other newly disclosed phone records that suggest Giuliani may have talked to Trump and Fox News host Sean Hannity on April 25, the same day Joe Biden declared his presidential bid.

AD

Trump was a guest on Hannity’s show that night and discussed a column by the conservative columnist John Solomon that described Biden’s efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor while he was vice president and questioned whether Biden had acted to protect his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence to back up that claim.

In a partisan, 13-to-9 vote Tuesday night, the House Intelligence Committee approved sending the report to the Judiciary panel. Republicans on the Intelligence Committee had issued their own report Monday, asserting that the majority party did not sufficiently make the case that Trump had committed impeachable offenses in the Ukraine matter.

AD

“House Democrats have been trying to undo the results of President Trump’s historic election since before he was sworn in,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a statement praising the minority report.

AD

The increasingly partisan impeachment fight continues as polling shows that the public remains deeply divided on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office.

Though the number of Americans who favored impeachment rose initially after the inquiry was announced in September, a Washington Post average of nationally representative polls conducted since the start of the public hearings on Nov. 13 found that the level of support for impeaching and removing Trump stood at 47 percent — little different from the 47 percent in the two weeks before the hearings began and 48 percent earlier in October. In key general-election states such as Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin, fewer voters back impeachment.

AD

The White House, which does not plan to participate in Wednesday’s hearing, continued its scathing criticism of how the Democrats have conducted their inquiry in its response to the report.

AD

“At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. “This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff’s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.”

In London, Trump said he would like top officials who have so far refused to cooperate in the House impeachment inquiry — such as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — to testify, but only in the Senate, where he believes he will get a fair trial.

AD

The White House has trained its focus on the Senate, where the president and his allies think they can fight on more favorable terrain against charges that he abused his office for political gain. Senate Republicans have been more muted in their defense of the president than their House colleagues but continue to back Trump, and it is highly unlikely at this point that two-thirds of the chamber would vote to remove him from office.

AD

White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who began strategizing with a small group of Senate Republicans last month on how to handle an impeachment trial, plans to attend a lunch with GOP senators Wednesday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has sidestepped most questions about the impending trial, on Tuesday outlined three scenarios that would help determine which witnesses are called and how the Senate proceedings would unfold.

One option is that McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) would negotiate a bipartisan deal on trial procedure, although the two leaders have yet to begin such discussions. Absent that, McConnell could attempt to round up 51 GOP senators in support of some procedural package.

The third option — which holds the most potential for chaos and is the least tantalizing course for the majority leader — would be for each side to put forward motions for witnesses and other procedural mechanisms one at a time, and senators would vote on each of them individually.

As the impeachment process continues, an increasing number of Senate Republicans have begun embracing the evidence-free claim — leveled primarily by Trump and his allies — that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election. That’s despite congressional testimony from administration officials and intelligence assessments that have found no merit to the claim that Ukrainians, and not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee email system in 2016.

“There’s no difference in the way Russia put their feet early on the scale, being for one candidate, and everybody called it meddling, and how the Ukrainian officials did it,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Tuesday, the second consecutive day he stated such claims.

From the Senate floor, Schumer called GOP assertions that Ukraine interfered “appalling.”

David Hale, the third-ranking official at the State Department, testified Tuesday that he was not aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election — and he supported the assessment of Fiona Hill, former White House National Security Council director for Russia and Europe, that the talking point was Russian propaganda.

“I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters Tuesday."

AD

Here are five takeaways from the report.

1. Democrats lay out why Trump should be impeached.

“The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election,” the executive summary of their report reads.

AD

How Democrats pieced together that allegation gives us clues as to what they think some of the articles of impeachment should be. Like:

Abuse of power: This is described throughout the report, such as here:

President Trump used the power of the Office of the President and exercised his authority over the executive branch, including his control of the instruments of the federal government, to apply increasing pressure on the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically-motivated investigations desired by President Trump.

And later, they write that asking Ukraine to investigate Democrats “was the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection.”

AD

Obstruction of Congress: This allegation is an entire section of the report, encompassing more than 50 pages. Democrats point out that an article of impeachment drawn up against Richard M. Nixon was for his failure to comply with subpoenas. Here’s their central allegation:

President Trump ordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct from the public and frustrate and obstruct the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry by refusing to produce to the impeachment inquiry’s investigating Committees information and records in the possession of the White House, in defiance of a lawful subpoena; directing executive branch agencies to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of all documents and records from the investigating Committees; directing current and former executive branch officials not to cooperate with the Committees, including in defiance of lawful subpoenas for testimony; and intimidating, threatening, and tampering with prospective and actual witnesses in the impeachment inquiry in an effort to prevent, delay, or influence the testimony of those witnesses.

Compromising national security:

By withholding vital military assistance and diplomatic support from a strategic foreign partner government engaged in an ongoing military conflict illegally instigated by Russia, President Trump compromised national security to advance his personal political interests. Faced with the revelation of his actions, President Trump publicly and repeatedly persisted in urging foreign governments, including Ukraine and China, to investigate his political opponent. This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.

This report touches on the fact that the Ukraine allegations stemmed from an effort to undercut special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation, but it doesn’t solve the internal debate among Democrats about whether to fold the Mueller report’s findings that Trump tried to undermine the special counsel into the impeachment articles.

AD

2. Trump’s White House gave Democrats their most solid evidence.

Democrats weren’t able to pin down that Trump himself explicitly laid out a quid pro quo with Ukraine when he held up Ukraine’s military aid and an Oval Office meeting. Because top Trump aides wouldn’t comply with subpoenas, the inquiry relied on people who hadn’t directly communicated with the president to paint a picture of what he wanted. U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified he heard this through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and others implicated Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, in the quid pro quo.

AD

So Democrats’ most solid evidence pinning the quid pro quos to Trump came from things people in the Trump administration did and said. Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky features heavily in the Intelligence Committee’s summary of why Trump should be impeached, taking up 10 pages. A key line:

AD

During a July 25, 2019, call between President Trump and President Zelensky, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for U.S. military assistance. President Trump immediately responded by asking President Zelensky to “do us a favor though” and openly pressed for Ukraine to investigate former vice president Biden and the 2016 conspiracy theory. In turn, President Zelensky assured President Trump that he would pursue the investigation and reiterated his interest in the White House meeting.

As Democrats note in their report, they aren’t alone in this analysis of the call being damaging for Trump. It was also referenced in many witnesses’ testimony as the moment it clicked that Trump had held up the military aid to Ukraine so that he had leverage to demand investigations. “I guess for me it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold,” testified Jennifer Williams, a Russia adviser to Vice President Pence. “There was no doubt,” Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House’s top Ukraine expert, testified when asked if he heard a political quid pro quo in that call.

Mulvaney did not comply with a subpoena to testify, but his public comments make their way to the top lines in the report: “At a press conference weeks after public revelations about the scheme, Mr. Mulvaney publicly acknowledged that the President directly tied the hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation, telling Americans to ‘get over it.’ ” (Mulvaney tried to walk back those comments later the same day.)

AD

The report also tries to counteract any attempts by Trump to push Giuliani under the bus, by using Giuliani’s own words. Here’s the tweet they held up:

AD

It won’t work! — Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) October 30, 2019

3. Democrats describe broad complicity in the Trump administration.

Pence. Mulvaney. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Former energy secretary Rick Perry. Senior White House aides. They’re all implicated in this report. They “had knowledge of, in some cases facilitated and furthered the President’s scheme, and withheld information about the scheme from the Congress and the American public,” Democrats write.

They rely heavily on the testimony from Sondland, who was the closest Trump ally that Democrats got to testify. Sondland testified that as he negotiated political quid pro quos with Ukraine, he looped in all of these senior officials. He brought emails and text messages to his public hearing as proof.

AD

In particular, Sondland stated his belief in a meeting with Pence that the release of military aid to Ukraine was tied to the Ukrainians announcing the launch of investigations. Sondland said Pence didn’t express his objections.

AD

The report’s authors include as evidence that Pence was in on Trump’s efforts the fact that the vice president spoke to Zelensky in September, after Sondland told Ukrainians there were conditions on getting their military aid — and that Pence won’t share the transcript of his call.

Pence has said he has “no recollection of any discussions” with Sondland before the Zelensky meeting.

4. Devin Nunes’s name is repeatedly listed in the report.

Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, is mentioned in the report dozens of times, and not just in his role as a counterpart to the leadership of the investigation. A former Nunes staff member is on the National Security Council, and the report says this staffer, Kash Patel, talked with Giuliani at a key moment in the pressure campaign and may have found a way to talk to the president about Ukraine, even though it wasn’t in his portfolio. The report also shows records of several phone exchanges between Giuliani and Nunes in April, as the campaign to dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine and oust the American ambassador there was ramping up.

The report doesn’t fill out Nunes’s role, but it provides some records that are consistent with the allegation by an indicted Ukrainian American, Lev Parnas, that Nunes was involved in this. (Nunes has said stories reporting this are “demonstrably false” but did not issue a direct denial when asked about his involvement with Ukrainians.)

AD

AD

5. They feel the need to impeach fast.

Democrats are pursuing Trump’s impeachment without hearing from top former aides, some of whom may have spoken directly to Trump about this and seem willing to testify. (We’re specifically thinking of former national security adviser John Bolton, who has said he’ll abide by the results of an ongoing lawsuit from another NSC official about what carries more weight, a subpoena from Congress or a White House ban on complying with that subpoena.)

The Democrats have faced some criticism for that, both inside and outside Congress. If they waited a few more months, could they connect the political quid pro quos to Trump without a shred of doubt? Instead, they are rushing to impeach Trump before it’s officially a presidential election year. To defend that rushed timing, they made an interesting argument in this report: that Trump might do this again if he’s not impeached ASAP.

Given the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through the courts. The evidence of the President’s misconduct is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress.

Of course, that argument ignores the fact that barring any major defections from Senate Republicans in a trial, Trump could be impeached by the House and remain president, free to negotiate with other countries as he sees fit.

“The President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security,” it adds.

AD

Here are three big takeaways:

The corrupt plot implicated multiple top administration officials and Trump allies.

The report goes out of its way to detail the ways the evolving scheme implicated top officials like acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

It recounts that when Ambassador Gordon Sondland worked in July to persuade Ukrainian officials to announce the investigations Trump wanted — into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in 2016 and into the Bidens — Sondland emailed all those officials to keep them informed.

AD

Sondland was trying to get Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to reassure Trump on their coming call (which would take place on July 25) that he would announce these investigations:

Ambassador Sondland emailed several top Administration officials, including Secretary of State Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Secretary Perry, stating that President Zelensky confirmed that he would “assure” President Trump that “he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will ‘turn over every stone.’” According to Ambassador Sondland, he was referring in the email to the Burisma/Biden and 2016 election interference investigations. Secretary Perry and Mr. Mulvaney responded affirmatively that the call would soon take place, and Ambassador Sondland testified later that “everyone was in the loop” on plans to condition the White House meeting on the announcement of political investigations beneficial to President Trump.

What this shows is that at a minimum, multiple cabinet officials fully understood in real time that an official act, one involving U.S. relations with a vulnerable ally, was being conditioned on carrying out investigations specifically geared toward giving Trump the political assistance he was demanding.

AD

The report also details that Pompeo was repeatedly briefed on the progress of the scheme going forward. This is the man responsible for implementing the nation’s foreign policies.

AD

Trump’s “no quid pro quo” defense has been reduced to smoking wreckage.

The report does a good job in blowing up one of Trump’s biggest defenses: that because he told Sondland there was “no quid pro quo” on one of their September phone calls, that means it was true.

As the report notes of Sondland’s testimony about one of those calls (it’s not clear how many there were):

Ambassador Sondland also testified that President Trump immediately followed his stated denial of a quid pro quo by demanding that President Zelensky still make a public announcement, while the military assistance remained on an unexplained hold.

Yes, of course. The military aid was still on hold, and Ukraine still desperately wanted it, and Trump superficially told Sondland that there was “no quid pro quo,” while also directing Sondland to tell Zelensky that he must still do Trump’s bidding, but of his “own” accord.

AD

Sondland has testified that he concluded that Trump wanted him to convey the extortion demand to Ukraine the way “two plus two equals four.” In other words, Sondland concluded this because Trump told it to him.

Trump has shown his corrupt undermining of our democracy will continue, posing a danger to the nation going forward.

The report strikingly portrays a president who recognizes zero constraints on his misconduct, making him a continuing threat to the country. As the report notes, Trump was emboldened, not chastened, by the fact that his campaign’s efforts to coordinate with and benefit from the 2016 Russian attack on our democracy — and Trump’s extensive efforts to derail the investigation into those matters to cover them up — ended with him facing no accountability.

Importantly, it was right after all this that Trump pressured Zelensky for another round of foreign intervention on July 25. The report describes this as “the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection.”

AD

AD

This is rarely discussed, but after Trump’s scheme had been unmasked, he repeated in reporters’ faces that Ukraine should investigate the Bidens. The report aptly casts this as a sign of the forward-looking threat Trump poses:

Trump does not appear to believe there is any such limitation on his power to use White House meetings, military aid or other official acts to procure foreign help in his reelection. When asked by a reporter on October 3 what he had hoped President Zelensky would do following their July 25 call, President Trump responded: “Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It’s a very simple answer.”

As the report concludes:

Faced with the revelation of his actions, President Trump publicly and repeatedly persisted in urging foreign governments, including Ukraine and China, to investigate his political opponent. This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.

The important point here is that Trump has made it absolutely clear that he will continue using whatever levers of government he can to corrupt the next election on his own behalf.

Crucially, though, Trump is simultaneously declaring the House impeachment process — and indeed, any and all House oversight — fundamentally illegitimate. As the report notes, Trump has “publicly and repeatedly rejected the authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his actions and has directly challenged the authority of the House to conduct an impeachment inquiry.”

AD

AD

In short: Trump is absolutely free to keep using government to cheat his way out of facing accountability in the next free and fair election, and the House cannot impeach him or even act to constrain this misconduct in any legitimate way that he feels obliged to acknowledge in the least.

The sum total of these postures, which Trump puts into practice daily, is that Trump does not acknowledge that he is subject to any legitimate constraints or mechanisms of accountability of any kind — he is simply not functioning as an actor in a constitutional democracy.

The remedy is plain.

Barr embodies the Trumpian edict that facts that undermine Trump’s defenses and unsubstantiated conspiracy theories are facts to be ignored. Somewhere, somehow, there are other “facts” out there that prove Trump’s innocence.

AD

AD

That mentality has enveloped the entire GOP, as we saw in House Republicans’ insistence on discredited allegations that Ukraine interfered in our election or that former vice president Joe Biden stopped an investigation into his son.

The believe-no-facts mind-set operates even when Republicans do the fact-finding or Republicans report the facts. The administration’s undersecretary of state for political affairs, David Hale, testified Tuesday that there is no doubt Russia interfered with our election and the accusation Ukraine did the same is fraudulent. And Politico reminds us of a Republican investigation that has gone down the memory hole:

President Donald Trump’s allies have defended his demand for political investigations from Ukraine by claiming that the government in Kyiv tried to sabotage his candidacy and boost Hillary Clinton in 2016. … But the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee thoroughly investigated that theory, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiry, and found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016.

Although House Republicans keep raising the name Alexandra Chalupa in the impeachment hearings, “an interview that fall with the Democratic consultant at the heart of the accusation that Kyiv meddled, Alexandra Chalupa, was fruitless, a committee source said, and Republicans didn’t follow up or request any more witnesses related to the issue.”

AD

AD

Yet that has not stopped Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) from making the ludicrous claim that Russia’s stealth campaign against Hillary Clinton is equivalent to individual Ukrainians’ public criticism of Trump. In an NBC interview on Monday, Burr asked: “Every elected official in the Ukraine was for Hillary Clinton. Is that very different than the Russians being for Donald Trump?” Yes, actually. Millions of people around the world had a preference for Clinton, but that does not mean they interfered with our election.

Burr blathered on: “You considered Russia meddling with just the preference they had before you knew the rest of it. Apply the same standard to Ukraine. The President can say that they meddled because they had a preference, the elected officials, that’s not the current people.” But Russia had more than a preference, as multiple intelligence agencies found. They had a Putin-directed plot to disrupt our election, a plot for which 13 Russian companies and nationals were indicted. And Burr’s own committee found no Ukrainian interference, something Burr chooses to ignore in favor of a specious comparison between Russia and Ukraine, something straight out of the Kremlin propaganda book.

Republicans’ contempt for truth will prevent a bipartisan vote on impeachment and removal despite the absence of any exonerating evidence to support Trump. The only remedy for the likes of Barr, Burr and House Republicans is a devastating defeat for Republicans in 2020, followed by professional discipline for Barr. In the meantime, keep in mind that every lie and every refusal to recognize undisputed reality confirms the GOP’s unfitness for public office.

Trump considered firing Atkinson, the New York Times reported, because the inspector general found the whistleblower’s complaint credible.

Atkinson didn’t mention Ukraine, but his reference to “recent events” is clear.

The complaint, about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find damaging information related to a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, was substantially confirmed during two weeks of public hearings last month by the House Intelligence Committee.

Nonetheless, Trump has insisted his call with Zelensky was “perfect.” Republicans have adamantly defended Trump, as they did in a staff report issued Monday that repeatedly criticized the whistleblower.

Atkinson’s defense of whistleblowers comes with a dose of uncertainty.

“Time will tell whether whistleblowers’ rights and protections will emerge from this period with the same legal, ethical, and moral strength they had previously,” he wrote. “It is my hope that recent events will not have a chilling effect on the willingness of individuals within the Intelligence Community to continue to shed light on suspected fraud, waste, abuse, or malfeasance in an authorized manner.”

AD

AD

That chilling effect is real in a government that punishes whistleblowers even as it celebrates them.

Atkinson, along with the other 70-plus inspectors general throughout the federal government, issues twice-yearly accounts of audits, management concerns and other sleepy topics that generate more snooze than news. But Atkinson used his latest report to defend whistleblowers and inspectors general broadly in the face of right-wing attacks.

Calling inspectors general “first responders” to “the most egregious matters, abuses of authority,” Atkinson, a former Justice Department official, said they “are able to fulfill their critical oversight function because, by law, they are independent of the agencies they oversee.” It’s a passage administration officials should take as instruction.

AD

Atkinson was not alone among inspectors general whose semiannual reports sent a message supporting whistleblowers.

AD

Kristi M. Waschull, the Defense Intelligence Agency inspector general, used her opening message to champion anonymity for whistleblowers who want it, even as Republicans on Capitol Hill have sought to unmask the Ukraine informant.

“Overall, maintaining confidentiality is of the utmost importance,” she wrote. “We do not disclose the identity of any whistleblower without their consent — unless disclosure is unavoidable, as required by law.”

Glenn A. Fine, head of the inspector general’s office at the Pentagon, added by email that “whistleblowers need to be protected from reprisals for their protected disclosures.” Waschull’s and Atkinson’s messages were previously reported by Government Executive.

AD

Atkinson received widespread support from his fellow inspectors general when almost all of them signed a letter backing him in his dispute with Trump’s Justice Department.

AD

A Sept. 3 memo from Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel concluded that because, in his view, the Ukraine whistleblower’s complaint “does not involve an ‘urgent concern,’ ” it did not require transmittal to Congress, as Atkinson did.

The letter from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency responded by saying Engel’s position “could seriously undermine the critical role whistleblowers play in coming forward to report waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct across the federal government” and “has the potential to undermine IG [inspector general] independence across the federal government.”

AD

Allowing other agency officials to second-guess decisions by inspectors general would be contrary to their independence and, the council’s letter added, “may impede the ability of Congress and taxpayers to obtain the objective and independent oversight they rely on from IGs.”

AD

“That would be a grave loss for IG oversight and, as a result, for the American taxpayer,” the letter concluded.

To create safer spaces for whistleblowers, their supporters want Congress to approve additional protections for federal employees who expose waste, fraud and abuse.

Among other measures, advocates have called for legislation that explicitly prohibits revealing whistleblowers’ identities if they want confidentiality. One long-standing proposal would allow federal whistleblowers to have civil jury trials in lawsuits against agencies accused of retaliation.

AD

Despite attempts to expose the Ukraine whistleblower’s identity and the Trump administration’s attempt to undermine Atkinson’s independence, he remains confident about the role of whistleblowers in the federal government.

“I am confident that those rights and protections will ultimately emerge stronger, and will not be diminished in any respect,” he wrote. “My optimism comes from my belief that the American people want an honest and effective government that reflects their hard-fought values.”

Cory Booker has yet to qualify for the December debate) and reward rich, non-serious candidates who can bump up poll numbers with massive ad buys (e.g., Tom Steyer, who qualified for this month’s debate later on Tuesday). If Democrats cannot come up with a methodology to include the former and exclude the latter, they should have a lower debate threshold or eliminate them entirely. Instead of incoherent events with candidates trying to create viral moments, a series of roundtables with candidates chosen randomly would be more useful before actual voting begins. Thereafter, the top five or six candidates can be invited to debate.

Second, the primary schedule is outrageously imbalanced for a party so reliant on nonwhite voters. Iowa’s and New Hampshire’s locks on the first two contests needs to end, or their importance diminished by adding more diverse states. Iowa and Ohio could be paired, for example, as could New Hampshire and New Jersey. Allowing candidates to gain momentum and eliminate other contenders without ever attracting significant nonwhite support shows a stunning lack of concern for the Democrats’ most important voters. It risks producing a nominee who cannot inspire and turn out the demographic essential for a Democratic victory.

AD

AD

None of this is to say that, with different states in the mix or a different debate set-up, nonwhite candidates would still be in the race. However, as things are currently structured, the party is eliminating candidates that its most loyal voters might have seriously considered while perpetuating candidates who do not have to appeal to those same voters.

No one should expect the remaining candidates to go after Iowa and New Hampshire’s prime positioning just weeks before voting starts. However, the party itself should pledge to revisit the entire nominating process — including the order of primary states. All the candidates on the stage later this month should be pressed as to whether the current system should be perpetuated simply because that is the way it has always been done.

The problem goes beyond the party rules, certainly. The media’s fascination with white, male, working-class voters, the Democrats’ own perceptions of who is “risky” and who is not, and the money advantage some candidates enjoy (because they are self-funded billionaires or because they can move money from previous campaigns to the current race) all play a part. This does not, however, excuse the party from addressing factors that are within its control.

AD

AD

Given that the Democratic nominee will almost certainly be white, we might expect a nonwhite vice presidential pick. Indeed, the days of Democrats running two white males may be over. However, the vice presidency is not a consolation prize. A party dedicated to rooting out racism needs to start with some introspection and recognition that the system as presently structured is neither fair nor helpful in selecting the nominee best situated to win.

Over the course of 58 calls on six days, Giuliani spent nearly two hours speaking with his associate Lev Parnas; with the Intelligence Committee’s ranking Republican, Devin Nunes (Calif.); with another attorney for Trump, Jay Sekulow; and with officials in the Office of Management and Budget. At times in this period, Giuliani spoke with people identified as connecting to him through switchboards in the White House or the White House Situation Room.

Those are just the calls for which the Intelligence Committee report offers specific details. There’s another instructive flurry of calls in early May as Giuliani was publicly exploring travel to Ukraine to assist his desired investigations. Those calls aren’t broken down with specific time stamps, but the exchanges are nonetheless revelatory.

Giuliani connected with someone at the White House on May 8 for more than six minutes. He also spoke with writer John Solomon, whose articles alleging impropriety in Ukraine were often cited by Giuliani and Trump, for about the same length of time. (Solomon is part of the loosely connected external team of attorneys and allies surrounding Giuliani that we’ve previously documented.) Giuliani separately spoke with Parnas and Derek Harvey, a Nunes staffer. Harvey traveled to Europe with Nunes at the end of last year, during a time the congressman was reported to have met with a former Ukrainian official. He was also in contact with other officials by phone, according to Parnas, and participated in Ukraine-focused meetings at Trump’s hotel in Washington.

AD

AD

The next day, with questions about Giuliani’s trip becoming public, he had lengthy conversations with Solomon and Parnas. After briefly connecting with White House switchboards, he had a four-minute call with someone at the White House. That evening, he had several more calls with Parnas.

On May 10, Giuliani spoke with Parnas several times. He then spoke for half an hour with Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker, who offered Giuliani advice related to his potential trip to the country. After speaking with Volker, Giuliani reached out without success to Kash Patel, a member of the National Security Council and former Nunes staffer. The two eventually connected.

After speaking to Patel, Giuliani talked with someone calling from a number identified in the committee report by the prefix ""-1.” The report doesn’t identify the number further, but it seems likely to represent Trump’s cellphone. Giuliani spoke to the “-1” number for 17 minutes and then to Parnas for an additional 12.

AD

AD

Giuliani canceled his trip later that day.

Where Giuliani’s outreach is best documented in the report is in relation to efforts to oust then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. This had been a focus of Parnas’s even before he worked for Giuliani, mentioned, for example, in the October indictment charging Parnas with campaign finance violations.

On April 1, Solomon published an article alleging improper behavior by former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine — an unfounded allegation that would become central to the Trump-Giuliani pressure campaign.

The report suggests that Giuliani, through Parnas, pressured Solomon to target Yovanovitch.

“Between April 1 and April 7, Mr. Parnas exchanged approximately 16 calls with Mr. Giuliani (longest duration approximately seven minutes) and approximately 10 calls with Mr. Solomon (longest duration approximately nine minutes),"" it reads. On April 7, Solomon wrote an article raising questions about Yovanovitch.

AD

AD

The report documents a number of contacts over the next several days between Giuliani, Parnas, and administration and government officials.

On April 10, for example, Giuliani and Nunes spoke several times over the course of 15 minutes, with Giuliani first calling Nunes and Nunes then returning the call. After sending a text message to an unknown number, Giuliani again called back — and tried a third time without success.

Later that same day, he spoke with Solomon for about five minutes.

On April 12, there were numerous contacts centered on Giuliani. In the morning, Parnas exchanged calls with Victoria Toensing, an attorney for whom Parnas did some translation work and who, with her husband, represented Solomon. That same day, Toensing was retained by two Ukrainians who had served as sources for stories by Solomon.

AD

AD

That same morning, Giuliani was contacted by the “-1” number. Over the course of the days documented in the report, Giuliani spoke with no individual contact more than “-1,” tallying at least 55 minutes. The records also indicate that “-1” always called Giuliani and not vice versa. On several occasions, the connections came after Giuliani called the White House.

He also spoke with someone at the Office of Management and Budget. It’s not clear who, but acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney remains the director of the OMB. (Walt Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, tweeted that “there is no good reason for Rudy Giuliani to be talking to OMB and plenty of bad ones.”)

The afternoon of April 12 involved a lengthy chain of communications, with Giuliani talking to Toensing, Parnas, Sekulow and someone at the OMB. He spoke with “-1” for more than 12 minutes.

AD

AD

Parnas spoke with Solomon and Nunes — and Giuliani, numerous times.

Yovanovitch was ultimately forced out of her position and recalled to the United States. That occurred early in the morning (Kyiv time) on April 25. In the days prior, Giuliani spoke repeatedly with the White House, the OMB and Parnas.

“At 7:14 p.m. Eastern Time on April 25, Mr. Giuliani once again received a call from an unknown '-1′ number, which lasted four minutes and 40 seconds,” the report states. “Minutes later, Mr. Giuliani held a brief 36 second call with Sean Hannity, a Fox News opinion host.”

A few hours later, Trump called into Hannity’s show.

By early August, Giuliani had already met with a senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the administration’s desire for Ukraine to announce politically useful investigations had been explicitly conveyed. Giuliani, Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had been working with Zelensky’s aide to develop a statement announcing the new probes.

AD

AD

On Aug. 8, Giuliani phoned or texted with people in the White House or at the OMB 19 times and had six contacts with the “-1” number, speaking for a bit longer than four minutes.

That call with “-1,” though, didn’t come easy. Giuliani texted the White House. An hour later, “-1” tried to contact Giuliani repeatedly, connecting only briefly if at all. Giuliani contacted the OMB without luck and then the White House multiple times. Only then did the individual identified as “-1” call back so they could speak.

The next day, Guiliani and Volker spoke, and Volker contacted Zelensky’s aide to try to finalize the desired statement.

On Tuesday, hours after the report was released, Nunes was interviewed by Hannity on Fox News. Asked if he’d ever spoken with Parnas, Nunes said he didn’t recall. “I remember that name now because he’s been indicted,” Nunes admitted. “But,” he added, “it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people.”

According to the report, Nunes and this particular random person spoke for more than eight minutes on April 12.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: What emails about Ukraine does President Trump think, or hope, will never get out?

During two interviews with FBI agents and members of Bob Mueller’s team last year, former White House communications director Hope Hicks recounted the president’s reaction to the discovery of damning emails about the meeting his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort took with a Russian emissary at Trump Tower in June 2016.

“Throughout Hicks’ conversations with Trump, it was clear to her that Trump did not think the emails would get out,” according to the FBI’s summary of her first interview, which was released on Monday night in response to an open-records lawsuit. “Hicks’ impression was Trump meant the emails would not get out to the press, but he did not say that explicitly.”

Hicks said she thought the messages would come out eventually and warned Trump that they would become “a massive” story.” She wanted “Junior” – as the FBI summaries refer to the president’s eldest son – to give an interview to a friendly media outlet, where he could take “softball questions,” to minimize the fallout. “The President said they should not do anything, asked why so many people had the emails, and said they needed to let the lawyers deal with it,” Hicks recalled to the FBI.

There are no fresh bombshells in these new summaries. The juiciest material appeared in Mueller’s 448-page report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the memos about Hicks’s FBI sit-downs, which both occurred in March 2018, offer a revealing window into how Trump tries to control bad news. Trump’s unwillingness to rip off the Band-Aid and get out in front of bad facts has resulted in a drip, drip, drip of revelations that have clouded most of his tenure in office.

-- Hicks’s comments are newly relevant against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry. The White House’s categorical refusal to comply with subpoenas for documents, from phone records to emails, has made it harder for investigators to corroborate sworn testimony from witnesses about the alleged campaign to coerce Ukraine’s new president to announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden in exchange for a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid that had already been approved by Congress.

A confidential White House review of Trump’s decision to freeze the aid has turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, three of my colleagues reported last week. But none of those emails have been turned over to investigators.

Trump appointees at the departments of State, Energy and Defense have also defied subpoenas and refused to produce documents that get at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. They have justified doing so by making absolutist claims of presidential privilege that have led to protracted litigation in the courts. The White House is refusing to participate at all in the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment hearing on Wednesday.

For her part, Ivanka Trump repeatedly conducted official government business on her personal email account throughout much of 2017, sending hundreds of emails in potential violation of federal recordkeeping rules. The White House adviser did so after her father made Hillary Clinton’s private email use as secretary of state a centerpiece of his stump speech, egging on crowds as they chanted “Lock her up.” The House Oversight Committee has unsuccessfully sought to subpoena Ivanka Trump’s emails.

-- House Democrats are also quietly debating whether they should expand articles of impeachment to include charges stemming from the Mueller report, including the episode Hicks discussed with the FBI. “Members of the House Judiciary Committee and other more liberal-minded lawmakers and congressional aides have been privately discussing the possibility of drafting articles that include obstruction of justice or other ‘high crimes’ they believe are clearly outlined in [the Mueller report] — or allegations that Trump has used his office to benefit his bottom line,” Rachael Bade reports. “The idea, however, is running into resistance from some moderate Democrats wary of impeachment blowback in their GOP-leaning districts, as well as Democratic leaders who sought to keep impeachment narrowly focused on allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals … The debate is expected to play out in leadership and caucus meetings this week.”

When the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks to appear for a closed-door interview this June about the possible instances of obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller report, the former White House communications director refused to answer any question related to her interactions with Trump after Election Day in 2016. Citing a directive from White House lawyers, Hicks declined to answer 155 different questions from lawmakers, according to a transcript.

-- BuzzFeed News and CNN filed lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act to force the release of these FBI notes, known as “302 reports,” that were created as part of the two-year Mueller probe. The 295-page tranche that went out last night is quite repetitive, and the interviews are still mostly whited out. The media outlets pledged to challenge the heavy redactions as part of the ongoing litigation to obtain records.

Hicks left the White House last year and now works at the Fox Corporation in Los Angeles as a public relations executive. During another closed-door deposition in February 2018, while she was still employed by the White House, Hicks acknowledged that she occasionally told “white lies” for Trump. Hicks was advised at the beginning of both her interviews that it is a crime to lie to the FBI in the course of an investigation, which she acknowledged.

-- Hicks told the FBI agents that “Trump was angry, surprised, and frustrated” when Mueller was appointed as special counsel in May 2017. “The only other time she had seen Trump like that was when the Access Hollywood tape came out during the campaign,” according to the FBI notes.

“Trump thought the fact that the intelligence community assessed the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election was his Achilles heel,” she added, according to the summary. “Even if it had no impact on the election, Trump thought that was what people would think. He thought the assessment took away from what he did.”

-- Hicks was treated like family during her time as a member of the Trump inner circle. The president referred to her affectionately as “Hopey.” He called her more often than his chief of staff at the time. The onetime fashion model from Greenwich, Conn., whose dad was a top executive at the NFL, was tight with the president’s kids, who she had gotten to know during her work for the Trump Organization before the presidential campaign.

That’s how she ended up in the White House residence on the morning of June 22, 2017, with only Trump, Kushner and Ivanka Trump. “Kushner had a manila folder with documents with him and said to the President that they had found one thing that the President should know about, but it was not a big deal,” according to Hicks’ account. “Kushner told Trump that he, Don Jr. and Paul Manafort had attended a meeting during the campaign. When he started to open the folder, Hicks said, the president stopped him and said he did not want to know about it.” Hicks believed Kushner’s folder included emails about the June 2016 meeting.

The next week, on June 28, Kushner asked Hicks and his spokesman Josh Raffel to go to the offices of someone whose name has been redacted (perhaps a lawyer) to review documents. “Hicks was shocked by the emails concerning the meeting she and Raffel reviewed,” the FBI write-up says. “She thought they looked really bad.”

The next day, on June 29, Hicks joined Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the president in his personal dining room to discuss about the emails. “Hicks’ initial reaction was that they should get in front of the emails,” according to the FBI summary. “Kushner responded that it wasn’t a big deal, just a meeting about Russian adoption. Kushner reminded the president that he had previously mentioned a meeting, and the President said he did not want to know about it.”

When Hicks said the story was going to become “massive,” the FBI summary says, “the President did not want to talk about it and did not want details.” Trump then asked Kushner when his document production was due. Kushner told him it would be a couple of weeks. “Then leave it alone,” Trump told Kushner, according to Hicks.

Fast forward a week to July 7. Kushner and Ivanka Trump came to Hicks’s hotel room in Germany to confer about how to respond to a story the New York Times was working on about the Trump Tower meeting. The next day, while they were all at the G-20 summit, Hicks alerted Trump about what the Times was chasing. The president told her not to comment.

Hicks and Trump talked again later that day. “The President asked what the meeting was about. Hicks told him Kushner and Junior had told her the meeting was about Russian adoption,” according to the FBI summary. “The President said words to the effect of, ‘Then just say that,’ and dictated what she should say.”

When they got to Air Force One for the flight back, one of Junior’s representatives texted Hicks the statement that the president’s son wanted to provide to the media. “She took that to the President’s cabin and read him Junior’s statement,” according to the FBI summary. “He told her they should not respond. Hicks advocated for providing the full story. The President did not say what was wrong with Junior’s statement, but just felt they were giving the media too much. … After meeting with Trump about Junior’s statement, Hicks returned to a seat and started texting with Junior. They worked on the statement for a period and ultimately settled on the statement that went to the press.”

During that flight back to Washington, Hicks also went to Trump’s cabin to tell him that then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus knew about the emails. There are four redacted paragraphs about what happened next.

-- A reminder of what was in the emails: British music publicist Rob Goldstone, who Don Jr. knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, emailed the candidate’s son to say that he knew a person who wanted “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Goldstone explained: “This is part of Russia and its government’s support of Trump”

“[I]f it’s what you say I love it,” Don Jr. replied, “especially later in the summer.”

That’s how the Trump Tower meeting got set up. It wasn’t adoption.

During the transition, Hicks told reporters in a statement that the Trump campaign had “no contact” with “any foreign entity,” including the Russians. She told the FBI that she recalled talking about this with fellow advisers Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, Jason Miller and “probably” Kushner. “Hicks told the group she was planning to respond to the press and there was no hesitation or pushback from any of them,” according to the FBI notes.

-- Other takeaways from the FBI notes released last night:

1. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, told FBI agents in November 2018 that he informed Trump during the campaign that he had spoken with a “woman from the Kremlin” about the plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. “Cohen told Trump he spoke with a woman from the Kremlin who had asked specific and great questions about Trump Tower Moscow, and that he wished Trump Organization had assistants that were that good and competent,” according to the FBI summary.

“He also said that in his letter to Congress about the development, he initially wrote that he had ‘limited contact with Russian officials.’ But that line was struck from the letter. Cohen said he did not know who specifically struck it,” BuzzFeed notes. “It was the decision of the JDA to take it out,” the document says, referring to lawyers from the Joint Defense Agreement who represented the Trump family, Cohen, and Kushner, “and Cohen did not push back.” Cohen also told the FBI that he spoke with Trump’s attorney Jay Sekulow about pardons after his home and office were raided. Sekulow told the AP that Cohen's statements were false.

2. Former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates told the FBI that, if Rudy Giuliani had been the attorney general, some in the president’s orbit believed he wouldn't have recused himself, as Jeff Sessions did, from the Russia investigation. “After the recusal, he recalled conversations where people offered their opinion that had Rudy Giuliani been attorney general, he would not have recused himself,” according to the FBI summary. “Gates knew Giuliani had been the first choice for attorney general, but turned it down because he wanted to be Secretary of State instead.”

3. Former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein told the FBI he was “angry, ashamed, horrified and embarrassed” at how Jim Comey was fired as FBI director. “Rosenstein said he was asked during a White House meeting one day before Comey’s firing to produce a memo laying out his concerns with the FBI chief. He said he knew when he left the office that day that Comey would be fired, though he said he did not expect for his memo to be immediately released, and was surprised by the portrayal in the media that the termination was his idea instead of the White House’s,” the AP reports. “Rosenstein said he expected Comey would be contacted by either Trump or Sessions so a meeting could be scheduled and he could be fired in person. Comey instead learned of his firing from television while speaking with agents in Los Angeles.

“At one point during the interview, as Rosenstein was describing how he had ‘always liked Jim Comey’ but disagreed with his decisions in the Clinton case, the deputy attorney general ‘paused a moment, appearing to have been overcome by emotion, but quickly recovered and apologized,’ according to the FBI.”

Attorney General William Barr listens as Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Nov. 26. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Attorney General Bill Barr has told associates he disagrees with the Justice Department’s inspector general on one of the key findings in an upcoming report about the FBI’s Russia investigation. Barr appears to disagree “that the FBI had enough information in July 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign,” Devlin Barrett and Karoun Demirjian scoop. “The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horo­witz, is due to release his long-awaited findings in a week, but behind the scenes at the Justice Department, disagreement has surfaced about one of Horowitz’s central conclusions on the origins of the Russia investigation. … The inspector general report, currently in draft form, is being finalized after input from various witnesses and offices that were scrutinized by the inspector general. Barr or a senior Justice Department official could submit a formal letter as part of that process, which would then be included in the final report.”

-- The Ukrainian government became aware of Trump’s freeze on military aid in July, according to former deputy foreign minister Olena Zerkal. From the Times: “‘We had this information,’ Ms. Zerkal said in an interview. ‘It was definitely mentioned there were some issues.’ … Ms. Zerkal’s account is the first public acknowledgment by a Ukrainian official that senior figures in Kyiv knew about the aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and that the Zelensky administration sought to keep that fact from surfacing to avoid getting drawn into the American impeachment debate. She said her own government blocked a trip she had planned to Washington to meet members of Congress in October, worried she would discuss matters related to impeachment and drag its president into an inquiry he has been eager to avoid. ‘They worried about this,’ she said of Mr. Zelensky’s advisers. ‘They said, ‘This is not the time for you to travel to D.C.’’ The cancellation of her trip was confirmed by Congressional aides.”

-- The Ukraine pressure campaign began as an effort to undermine the Mueller investigation. Rosalind S. Helderman reports: “As 2018 came to a close, the special counsel investigation was bearing down on [Trump.] … It was in this uncertain moment that [Giuliani] said he had the idea to focus on Ukraine. … The direct connection between the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine pressure campaign, often lost as the administration has reeled from controversy to controversy, shows the deep imprint the Russia investigation has had on the president. … Giuliani has repeatedly said the public does not appreciate the extent to which his work in Ukraine was driven by the Mueller investigation, rather than — as Democrats have alleged — as an effort to bolster Trump’s 2020 reelection.”

-- The Senate Intelligence Committee already investigated allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 campaign. From Politico: “Trump’s allies have defended his demand for political investigations from Ukraine by claiming that the government in Kyiv tried to sabotage his candidacy … But the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee thoroughly investigated that theory, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiry, and found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016. The committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in October 2017 that the panel would be examining ‘collusion by either campaign during the 2016 elections.’ But an interview that fall with the Democratic consultant at the heart of the accusation that Kyiv meddled, Alexandra Chalupa, was fruitless, a committee source said, and Republicans didn’t follow up or request any more witnesses related to the issue.”

-- House Republicans said Trump acted out of “genuine” concern about corruption in Ukraine and wariness about foreign aid in a preemptive rebuttal to Democratic allegations that Trump abused his power. Mike DeBonis reports: “In a 123-page draft report, GOP investigators assert that Democrats failed to make the case that Trump committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors ... Nor, the Republicans say, do Democrats have a basis for impeachment in Trump’s decision to spurn House document requests and witness subpoenas pertaining to Trump’s Ukraine dealings. Instead, the draft GOP report contends, the impeachment effort is ‘an orchestrated campaign to upend our political system’ … The Republican report will serve as an initial blueprint for the GOP defense of Trump…”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the majority’s report will be released publicly today. “We are putting the finishing touches on the report,” he told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. The panel is scheduled to vote this evening to approve its public release ahead of tomorrow’s Judiciary hearing.

-- Federal prosecutors will probably bring more charges against Giuliani’s associates Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas. From NPR: “A superseding indictment — which could add to or modify the existing charges — is likely, prosecutors said on Monday, but also adding that they're continuing to evaluate the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and FBI investigators are making their way through what prosecutor Douglas Zolkind called a ‘voluminous’ amount of evidence in the case — around 9 gigabytes' worth. Clearing their way through that material — which includes electronic devices, phone records, bank records and more — would set the stage for the next steps.”

-- The IRS whistleblower who raised concerns about political interference in the presidential audit program declined to voluntarily appear for a transcribed interview with the Senate Finance Committee, possibly because he was threatened with retaliation by his superiors. From CNN: “After raising concerns over the summer, the whistleblower met in November with Republican and Democratic staffers on the committee but has declined an invitation to appear for a follow-up … [T]he whistleblower declined the transcribed interview after an official informed the whistleblower that it could be considered a violation of IRS code to provide the committee with any information related to an individual taxpayer. Under IRS code 6103, IRS employees can be fired, fined or even jailed for disclosing taxpayer information. It is unclear what next step the committee will take. One option would be to issue a subpoena, but it is not clear that is the route the committee would take.”

Duncan Hunter leaves federal court after a hearing in San Diego.(Denis Poroy/AP)

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) plans to plead guilty to misusing campaign funds at a hearing set for 1 p.m. Eastern. “I think it’s important not to have a public trial for three reasons. And those three reasons are my kids,"" Hunter said in an interview with San Diego-based TV station KUSI. In July, federal prosecutors alleged that the congressman used campaign donations to finance extramarital affairs -- including trips, dinners and drinks -- with at least five women, including three lobbyists, a woman who worked in his congressional office and another who worked for a member of House leadership. Hunter told the local TV station that he “did make mistakes” but that “not a single dime of taxpayer money is involved in this.” He said he will plead guilty to only one of four counts against him as part of the deal. ""Whatever my time in custody is, I will take that hit,"" he said.

When he was first indicted last summer, Hunter called this a politically motivated witch hunt and said he was looking forward to the trial so he could fully vindicate himself. Initially, Hunter and his wife were charged with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including family vacations, theater tickets and school tuition. The couple allegedly agreed in electronic communications to claim that some of the expenses were intended to help veterans, even though they weren't. Then, in June, Margaret Hunter pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with her husband to spend $25,000 in campaign funds for personal use. As part of the plea deal, she flipped on her husband and agreed to testify against him.

Today's plea deal means that the first two members of Congress to endorse Trump for president in 2016 will be convicted criminals. Hunter and Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) came out for Trump in February of that year, about a week before Jeff Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump. Earlier this year, Collins resigned from Congress and pleaded guilty to insider trading charges. The crime he confessed to occured while he was standing on the White House lawn at a picnic hosted by Trump. These episode underscore just how swampy Trump's Washington has been.

Hunter didn't say whether he will resign as part of the plea deal, but that seems like a safe assumption. He's already facing serious primary challenges from former congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and former San Diego city councilman Carl DeMaio, Felicia Sonmez notes. Hunter won the congressional seat after his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., retired from it to run for president in 2008.

-- The North Dakota company that Trump urged military officials to hire for border wall construction received a $400 million contract to build a span of new barriers across an Arizona wildlife refuge. Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report: “North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel won the contract to build in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in Yuma County, Ariz., the Defense Department said, with a target completion date of Dec. 30, 2020. Trump has repeatedly pushed for Fisher to get a wall-building contract, urging officials with the Army Corps of Engineers to pick the firm — only to be told that Fisher’s bids did not meet standards. Trump’s entreaties on behalf of the company have concerned some officials who are unaccustomed to a president getting personally involved in the intricacies of government contracting.

""Trump has been enamored with Tommy Fisher, the company’s chief executive, who has made multiple appearances on Fox News to promote his firm and insists that it would do a better job than those the government had already chosen. ... Fisher has worked with some Trump allies — including former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach and ex-White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon — to build border fencing on private land using private donations. ... Trump has pledged to complete 450 to 500 miles of new border barriers by the end of next year. So far his administration has built about 85 miles of fencing, almost all of it in areas where tall steel bollards are replacing smaller, older structures that were there before he took office.""

-- A new biography of Melania Trump by CNN’s Kate Bennett reveals that the first lady doesn't just live in her own bedroom. She actually lives on a different floor of the White House than the president: “Melania Trump has her own quarters in the White House. ... It is true the first couple doesn't share a bedroom, according to several sources, and the first lady prefers her own large, private space in a suite of rooms on a separate floor.” Bennett also reveals that the first lady was “beside herself with guilt” after her speech at the Republican National Convention was criticized for including parts from a speech given by Michelle Obama: “Not only did Melania Trump feel badly for her speechwriter, she also felt she had let down her husband on what should have been her most triumphant speaking engagement to date. The truth was, sources conclude, it was Donald Trump that let down Melania Trump. A skeleton staff of political neophytes neglected to read Melania Trump's speech, much less vet it for content.”

-- According to the new book, the first lady suspects that longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone was behind the release of nude photos from her modeling days during the 2016 campaign. From the Guardian: “Bennett also writes that the first lady ‘still refuses to believe’ her husband played a role in the release. ... Stone denied Bennett’s claim while the White House poured scorn on her book.”

-- The Supreme Court heard a Second Amendment case for the first time in a decade, but the debate ended up being on whether a case concerning gun restrictions is still worth considering. Robert Barnes reports: “The controversy involves now-rescinded restrictions unique to New York City about whether citizens who have a license to keep a gun in their homes may transport them to firing ranges outside of the city or to a second home in the state. After the Supreme Court took the case to decide whether those restrictions violated the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the city got rid of them. Then the state of New York passed a law that would keep them from being reenacted. The unstated purpose of both the city and state actions might have been to make the case moot and deny conservatives on the court a chance to explore whether there is a right to carry a gun outside the home. … The arguments Monday suggested that New York would have had trouble defending the old regulations. But most of the hour-long discourse was consumed with questions about whether the court still has a live controversy before it, a requirement for rendering an opinion. The court denied New York’s earlier plea to dismiss the case as moot. It said it would consider the question after argument.”

-- Barr's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to let federal executions proceed next week by “setting aside” a district court’s injunction that blocks it from carrying out lethal injections as planned. Mark Berman reports: “This request, which came hours after an appeals court blocked a similar application, marked an escalation of the administration’s push to restart federal executions after a nearly two-decade hiatus. …. The Justice Department argued in its 38-page filing Monday that the judge’s interpretation of the law is ‘implausible.’ The filing, signed by Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, dismissed what it called a ‘flawed injunction against the implementation of lawful executions.’ [Barr], in announcing plans to resume executions, had said the department owes it to victims to carry out the sentences, though some relatives of the first inmate facing execution have urged the administration to call off the lethal injection and sentence him to life in prison instead.”

-- Trump recently gave states the power to ban refugees. But deeply conservative and devout Utah wants more of them. Griff Witte reports: “The governor, a Republican who aligns with Trump on most issues, wrote the president a letter in late October. He didn’t want to keep refugees out. He didn’t want to reduce their numbers. He wanted Trump to send more. ‘We empathize deeply with individuals and groups who have been forced from their homes and we love giving them a new home and a new life,’ Gov. Gary R. Herbert wrote. Such newcomers, he added, have become ‘productive employees and responsible citizens.’ They have been an asset to Utah, he said, not a liability. Republicans in the state legislature quickly backed up their governor, daring to defy a president who has repeatedly shown an unwillingness to tolerate intraparty dissent. So did Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation. So did Republicans in city halls. Democrats across Utah added their support. ‘I have to be honest: I don’t have any idea why it’s a partisan issue nationally. It’s never been one here,’ said Brad Wilson, the state’s Republican speaker of the House. ‘Regardless of political party, we value these people.’”

-- Ballroom dancers say a clampdown on immigration is hurting business. From the AP: “When no Americans replied to her ads seeking a dance instructor, studio owner Chris Sabourin looked overseas. But she was stymied again by a federal tightening of visa application rules she and others contend is hampering the ballroom dance industry. … Federal records ... show a slight uptick since 2017 in initial denials of O-1 visa applications from individuals with 'extraordinary ability or achievement' — the visa that many of the foreign dancers seek — as well as for O-1 visa applicants who were given a second chance to meet eligibility requirements. Representatives of the dance industry say they’ve seen the processing times for those nonimmigrant visas, which allow the dancers to work in the U.S. for up to three years, increase from weeks to months, with uncertainty the application will be approved.”

-- A janitor working for the Border Patrol saved and photographed migrants’ belongings that were thrown away by U.S. officials. From the Los Angeles Times: “While working as a janitor at the same facility from 2003 to 2014, photographer Tom Kiefer secretly collected the belongings and later began shooting them. … The first items to pull Kiefer’s attention were 15 to 20 toothbrushes. At the time, he didn’t think about photographing them. He just felt compelled to remove them from the trash. ‘When I started seeing a rosary, or a Bible, or a wallet, I realized that no one would believe me if I had not collected these items.’ It took about six years of collecting — blankets, cellphones, toilet paper, depression medication, shoelaces — before Kiefer began photographing. … Kiefer estimates he has more than 100,000 items collected and stored in his studio and other spaces around Ajo. The word he uses to describe how he copes with the magnitude of his collection: compartmentalize. … ‘Our government is actually taking away a Bible or rosary,” he said. “I mean, how twisted is that?’”

-- The United Auto Workers has bolstered its financial controls in an effort to prevent embezzlement and bribery that was uncovered as part of a federal probe of the union. From the AP: “The moves announced Monday by Secretary-Treasurer Ray Curry come after last month’s resignation of President Gary Jones, who has been implicated in the scandal. Several other union officials have been charged or implicated in the probe, which embarrassed the union leadership and angered many of its 400,000 members when it became public starting in 2017. Curry says the reforms will put checks and balances in place to prevent financial misconduct.”

-- Former president Jimmy Carter was hospitalized again to treat a urinary tract infection. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The Carter Center says ‘he is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon.’ The incident comes three weeks after Carter was hospitalized ahead of a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by a subdural hematoma, a collection of blood outside the brain, spurred by his recent falls. He was released from the hospital on Wednesday, in time for Thanksgiving, and there were no complications from the surgery.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Cracks in the Greenland ice sheet are producing massive waterfalls, raising scientists’ concerns for sea level rise. Andrew Freedman reports: “A cerulean lake consisting of glacial meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet, located about 18 miles from where the Store Glacier meets the sea in west Greenland, briefly became one of the world’s tallest waterfalls during the course of five hours in July 2018. The waterfall, like many others on the ice sheet’s surface, was triggered by cracks in the ice sheet. In the case of this one meltwater lake that scientists closely observed in July 2018, the water cascaded more than 3,200 feet to the underbelly of the glacier, where the ice meets bedrock. There, the water can help lubricate the base of the ice sheet, helping the ice move faster toward the sea. The observations of scientists, armed with aerial drones and other high-tech equipment, of the partial lake drainage that resulted could help researchers better understand how surface melting of the ice sheet could affect its melt rate, and improve global sea level rise projections.

“Scientists are keenly interested in how meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet — the largest contributor to global sea level rise — acts to speed up the movement of ice toward the sea by lubricating the underside of the ice surface. The new study, published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that scientists are underestimating the number of melt ponds that partially, and rapidly, drain into the ice sheet each year. This means tweaks may be needed to the computer models used to predict sea level rise from Greenland. This is the first study to show that partial lake drainage can occur through cracks in the ice, rather than overtopping or other mechanisms, which was previously the assumption. This means even more water is reaching the base of the ice sheet than previously thought.”

-- Trump revved up his global trade war yesterday by not only announcing tariffs on metals from Brazil and Argentina, but also by threatening even harsher penalties on dozens of popular French products. David J. Lynch, Rachel Siegel and Terrence McCoy report: “The administration said the moves were necessary because U.S. trading partners were acting unfairly to disadvantage both the country’s traditional economic pillars as well as its best hopes for future prosperity. … The unexpected announcement upends the Latin American countries’ 2018 agreement with Trump to accept quotas on their shipments to the United States instead of the import taxes. … Later, Robert E. Lighthizer, the president’s chief trade negotiator, released the results of a five-month investigation that concluded a French digital services tax discriminated against American Internet companies and should be met with tariffs of up to 100 percent on $2.4 billion in products such as cheese, yogurt, sparkling wine and makeup. The proposal, which awaits a presidential decision, threatens to intensify simmering transatlantic trade friction …

“Fallout from the president’s renewed embrace of tariffs could cloud prospects for future or ongoing talks with countries in Asia and Europe. … Administration officials worry that the French tax could set a precedent for other countries. Lighthizer said he may open investigations into similar taxes in Austria, Italy and Turkey. … The president’s enthusiasm for tariffs is not shared by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who has said they are making executives so uncertain about the outlook that companies are delaying investments and slowing the economy. … Typically, the United States provides businesses with some warning of tariff changes, delaying their effective date to allow goods in transit to arrive at American ports without being taxed. But the president tweeted that his tariff order was ‘effective immediately.’”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, hit with the new tariffs, has learned the hard way what so many others have discovered before him: A good personal relationship with Trump has its limits. David Nakamura and Anne Gearan report: “Bolsonaro and his country’s diplomats in Washington were blindsided after Trump issued a pair of early morning tweets announcing punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports … For Bolsonaro, a far-right leader who had patterned his campaign after Trump’s and aggressively sought to ingratiate himself with the White House, the tariffs represented an embarrassing reality check on his strategy of gambling his administration's foreign policy largely on good personal chemistry with a president who craves validation — but who views virtually all relationships as transactional and, potentially, disposable.”

-- This is not the first time that Bolsonaro has gotten burned by Trump. Terrence McCoy reports: “Over and over in recent months, Bolsonaro has been surprised and stung by Trump’s slights and about-faces. Trump told Bolsonaro this year he would back Brazil’s bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a promise Bolsonaro then touted as a political achievement. But then the U.S. recommendation letter leaked, showing that the Trump administration was supporting Romania and Argentina for membership, not Brazil. A few weeks later, the U.S. government refused Bolsonaro’s request to lift its ban on Brazilian imports of beef over safety concerns — again taking his administration by surprise. Now Trump is targeting one of the most important industries in Brazil, at a time when unemployment is above 10 percent and the economy has stalled.”

-- Stocks sank amid disappointing manufacturing and construction data and Trump’s escalating trade wars. Taylor Telford and Thomas Heath report: “‘All this trade friction is weighing on the manufacturing sector, reminding us that protectionism is not a victimless crime,’ said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Nine of 11 stock market sectors declined Monday, with industrials, information technology and real estate leading the slide. All but seven of the Dow 30 blue chips finished in negative territory, with Boeing, American Express and United Technologies the biggest drags.”

-- The Trump administration quietly released more than $100 million in military assistance to Lebanon after months of unexplained delays that led some lawmakers to compare it to the frozen aid for Ukraine that prompted the impeachment inquiry. From the AP: “The $105 million in Foreign Military Financing funds for the Lebanese Armed Forces was released just before the Thanksgiving holiday and lawmakers were notified of the step on Monday, according to two congressional staffers and an administration official. … The money had languished in limbo at the Office of Management and Budget since September although it had already won congressional approval and had overwhelming support from the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council. The White House has yet to offer any explanation for the delay despite repeated queries from Congress.”

-- China is using DNA to map faces as Beijing’s pursuit of control over a Muslim ethnic group continues pushing the rules of science and consent. From the Times: “With a million or more ethnic Uighurs and others from predominantly Muslim minority groups swept up in detentions across Xinjiang, officials in Tumxuk have gathered blood samples from hundreds of Uighurs — part of a mass DNA collection effort dogged by questions about consent and how the data will be used. In Tumxuk, at least, there is a partial answer: Chinese scientists are trying to find a way to use a DNA sample to create an image of a person’s face. The technology, which is also being developed in the United States and elsewhere, is in the early stages of development and can produce rough pictures good enough only to narrow a manhunt or perhaps eliminate suspects. But given the crackdown in Xinjiang, experts on ethics in science worry that China is building a tool that could be used to justify and intensify racial profiling and other state discrimination against Uighurs.”

-- North Korea said that dialogue with the U.S. has been nothing but a “foolish trick” and warned Washington that it could be on the receiving end of an unwelcome Christmas gift. Simon Denyer reports: “The North Korean regime has given the United States until the end of the year to drop its ‘hostile policy,’ come up with a new approach to talks and offer concessions in return for its decision to end nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in 2018. But a recent decision by the United States to postpone a joint air drill with South Korea clearly hasn’t satisfied Pyongyang. Ri Thae Song, vice foreign minister in charge of U.S. affairs, accused Washington of trying to buy time by calling for a ‘sustained and substantial dialogue,’ but he rejected this approach. … ‘The DPRK has done its utmost with maximum perseverance not to backtrack from the important steps it has taken on its own initiative,’ he said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency. ‘What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get.’ North Korea has a history of timing launches with an eye on international developments and even U.S. holidays.”

-- On the first day of the NATO Summit, Trump slammed French President Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of NATO as “very, very nasty” and “disrespectful.” Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: Referring to comments Macron made “last month in an interview with The Economist — in which Macron described the ‘brain death’ of NATO due to lack of American support — Trump attacked Macron during his first remarks on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London, calling the comments ‘very insulting.’ ‘You just can’t go around making statements like that about NATO,’ Trump said, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders Tuesday morning. Though Trump himself has long been a vocal critic of NATO — a combative stance that has alarmed Western allies and seemed to prompt Macron’s comments — Trump took umbrage at the French assessment of the alliance, and depicted France as the beneficiary of American largesse. ‘I would say that nobody needs NATO more than France,’ Trump said.”

-- Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pair of bills. One requires all consumer electronic devices sold in the country to be pre-installed with Russian software. Another will require individual journalists to register as foreign agents. From Fox News: “Government officials say the law will help Russian IT firms compete with foreign companies, which dominate Russia’s mobile phone market, Reuters reported. Another law signed by Putin Monday is a bill that gives the government the right to register bloggers, journalists and social media users as foreign agents. The bill is an extension of an existing law adopted in response to the U.S. Justice Department’s 2017 decision to label the Russian state-funded network RT as a foreign agent.

-- The American woman who claims convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with Britain’s Prince Andrew told the BBC that the episodes were “disgusting” and asked for support from the British public. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “‘This is not some sordid sex story, this is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse, and this is a story of your guys’ royalty,’ Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the BBC in an hour-long documentary that aired Monday night. … Giuffre — now 35 and a mother of three — told the BBC that she was passed around to Epstein’s rich and powerful friends ‘like a platter of fruit.’ She said she was trafficked to Andrew three times in 2001 and 2002: once in London at the home of Epstein’s girlfriend, once at Epstein’s New York mansion and once on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. ‘It didn’t last long,’ she said of the first of three alleged encounters with the prince. ‘He got up, and he said thanks, I sat there in bed, just horrified and ashamed and felt dirty,’ Giuffre said.” The prince has denied that he had sex with her.

-- The rape and killing of a veterinarian on her way home from work have shaken India. Joanna Slater reports: “The killing of the 26-year-old veterinarian in the South Indian city of Hyderabad last week has provoked outrage and anguish across India, the latest in a series of gruesome, high-profile crimes against women and girls. Police arrested four men and said they had confessed to the killing. Speaking in Parliament on Monday, India’s defense minister called it an ‘inhuman’ crime that has ‘brought shame to the entire country.’ … After news of the veterinarian’s killing spread, demonstrations erupted in Hyderabad over the weekend. Thousands of people protested at a police station near where the woman’s body was found and outside the gated compound where her family lives. In New Delhi, a young woman was arrested for holding a sign in a high-security area outside Parliament that read, ‘Why can’t I feel safe in my own India?’”

-- The Pacific island nation of Samoa will shut down government services for two days so civil servants can focus on a nationwide immunization drive as the country struggles to end a measles outbreak that has so far claimed more than 50 lives, most of them children. From NPR: “Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi announced the closure on Monday, saying the government is relying on ‘village councils, faith-based organizations, and church leaders, village mayors and government women representatives’ to persuade the public to get vaccinated. As a result, he said, all but public utility government services will be shuttered Dec. 5 and 6. More than 3,700 measles cases have been reported since the outbreak began in October, with 198 recorded within a 24-hour period. Fifty-three people have died and of those, 48 are children under 4 years old.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden may lose the Iowa caucuses. But, by betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas, he may still secure the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. From the Times: “If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests. … While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates. A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters. …

“Some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.) Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates. This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.”

-- In a wide-raging interview aboard the “No Malarkey” bus, the former vice president said he doesn’t need Obama’s endorsement, scoffed at the idea that Elizabeth Warren is building enthusiasm and accused Pete Buttigieg of stealing his plans. From Politico: “Biden reiterated that he asked Obama not to endorse him, and he stuck by that stance even when asked whether he’d want Obama’s backing if the field narrowed to three people. ‘No, because everyone knows I’m close with him,’ Biden said. ‘I don’t need an Obama endorsement.’ … Biden was asked about a POLITICO Magazine article that recently reported how Obama had confided in another candidate that his former vice president ‘really doesn’t have it’ when it comes to an intimate connection with voters. ‘He may have said that. And if it’s true, and he said it, there’s truth to it,’ Biden acknowledged on Monday before saying that he has ‘mostly campaigned for other people in the time I’ve been here. And I’ve never been in a position seeking the nomination where I have had the money and the organization to be able to get open headquarters all over the state.’ …

“Biden lamented media coverage that he said initially dismissed the durability of his candidacy because he was too moderate and didn‘t embrace policies like Medicare for All. Biden said the field was now moving closer to his views and away from the left. When asked whether he unintentionally set the stage for Buttigieg, who is leading in the polls in Iowa, Biden grew animated. ‘Set it up? He stole it! Set it up?’ Biden said of the mayor of South Bend, Ind. … The former vice president then accused the media of going too easy on Buttigieg, saying his opponent had once supported a more liberal health care plan but then pivoted … When asked about another polling leader in Iowa and elsewhere — Warren — Biden dismissed her rise and the notion that she had momentum behind her. ‘Look at the polling everywhere. Tell me. Tell me where the polling has manifested itself,’ he said. ‘She lives in Massachusetts, she’s invested millions and millions of dollars in New Hampshire, why shouldn’t she be known there?’”

-- Three state lawmakers acknowledge that lobbyists helped craft their op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all. Jeff Stein reports: “Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client. Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms. Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) confirmed in a brief interview that the lawmaker’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all was written with the help of Kathleen DeLand, an Ohio-based lobbyist. None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist.”

-- The Trump campaign denied credentials to journalists from Bloomberg News, accusing the organization of “bias” against the president. Kayla Epstein and Derek Hawkins report: “Bloomberg News faced a journalistic quandary when its owner, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, decided to jump into the 2020 Democratic primary last month. In a widely criticized decision, editor in chief John Micklethwait announced that the newsroom would continue its tradition of not investigating Bloomberg’s personal life and finances, and would extend the same policy to his Democratic opponents. The move was intended to avoid conflict of interest in the Democratic primary. Micklethwait noted, however, that Bloomberg News would continue to investigate the Trump administration. After the Trump campaign announced its decision Monday to bar Bloomberg News, President Trump took to Twitter to attack the news outlet and the New York Times for their coverage of him.”

-- The New York Times is overhauling its traditional closed-door endorsement process for Democratic presidential candidates and will instead conduct interviews with the contenders on the record and air parts of the discussions – along with the editorial board’s final decision – on its show “The Weekly.” (Politico)

-- A month after ending his presidential campaign, Beto O’Rourke is setting his focus on flipping the Texas state house. From the Houston Chronicle: “With Texas Democrats nine seats away from retaking the majority of seats in the Texas House, O’Rourke is trying to convince his donor base to send money to an organization called Flip The Texas House, which has targeted 17 House Districts in which Republican candidates won by fewer than 10 percentage points last year. More than half are districts in which O’Rourke won the majority of votes as he ran for U.S. Senate.”

-- With just a week remaining before the deadline to run for office in Texas next year, some of O’Rourke’s supporters are still hoping to see him jump into the race to unseat Sen. John Cornyn (R). They even commissioned a poll that shows he’d sail through the Senate primary were he to join the race. From the Dallas Morning News: “The poll also shows him in a near-tie, trailing Cornyn 46-42 at this point, which is far stronger than others already seeking the nomination. O’Rourke’s campaign operation has gone dormant. He didn’t respond to messages on Monday and hasn’t said lately whether he’s interested. … During his presidential campaign, O’Rourke said flatly and repeatedly that he would not even consider running for the Senate in 2020 … ‘I know it’s a bit of a longshot to try and convince Beto to do this, but it is clear to a lot of people in Texas that that would be the best thing for us,’ said Alan Metni, executive director of the Democratic Policy Institute, the group that commissioned the new poll.""

-- Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp isn’t expected to nominate Rep. Douglas Collins, Trump’s pick, for a soon-to-be-open Senate seat. He’s now facing heavy backlash – including threats of a primary challenge. Seung Min Kim reports: “Kemp is expected to tap business executive Kelly Loeffler for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) … The public outcry against Kemp and Loeffler from Trump allies has led some of them to threaten a primary challenge against the first-term governor, and they have urged the president’s supporters to flood Kemp’s office with calls pushing him not to select Loeffler. … Conservative radio host Mark Levin derided Kemp as ‘another Romney,’ referring to the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and current senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, as he accused the Georgia governor of being on the precipice of appointing a ‘RINO,’ a Republican in name only … The formal announcement from Kemp is expected on Wednesday, the officials said, so as to not interfere with Isakson’s farewell address on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon.”

-- In a big break for Republican hopes of holding the Senate, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) no longer faces a primary challenge in his reelection bid. From the News & Observer: “Raleigh retired businessman Garland Tucker is ending his campaign for the Republican nomination in the U.S. Senate … Tucker invested more than $1.5 million of his own money to challenge Tillis, who is seeking a second term in 2020. Monday marked the beginning of the 2020 filing period in North Carolina. Tucker, who joined the race in May, opted not to file. … The letter cited the attention on the ongoing impeachment inquiry into [Trump] as well as Tillis’ role as one of his defenders in the Senate as a reason for Tucker’s decision to end his campaign.”

-- An outspoken Holocaust denier, activist anti-Semite and white supremacist filed again for a Chicago-area House seat. From the Chicago Sun-Times: “Arthur Jones, of suburban Lyons, won the GOP nomination in 2018 because he was the only Republican on the 3rd District primary ballot. In the general election, he was easily beaten by Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., but received about 26 percent of the vote even after his views were exposed.”

Trump’s defenders suggest that they reflect Trump’s concerns about corruption (the Biden ask) and interference in the 2016 election by Ukraine (the hacking), though Trump’s asks were specifically not about either of those things. They were, instead, about specific theories that are and always have been broadly lacking in evidence — which, of course, is likely why his defenders are looking to recontextualize what Trump asked. The president’s opponents argue that his goal was instead self-serving, to undermine a possible 2020 election opponent and to undercut the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which was a nuisance to Trump for much of his presidency.

It is also understood that Trump declined to finalize a meeting at the White House with Zelensky (something the Ukrainian eagerly sought) and that he blocked the disbursement of congressionally approved aid to the country. Here, the disagreement is on the significance of those acts: Trump’s defenders claim they were either unimportant or a natural extension of Trump’s opposition to foreign assistance; his critics note that each offered points of leverage that could be used to push Ukraine to announce the aforementioned investigations. According to multiple witnesses, that’s in fact what happened.

It is nonetheless up to observers to determine which line of argument to accept, a theoretically necessary underpinning to answering the fundamental question at stake in impeachment: Did Trump behave in a way that necessitates his impeachment?

(We say “theoretically” because the evidence at hand strongly suggests that views of impeachment are driven far more by party identity than by the evidence presented.)

AD

AD

Three months ago, we simply didn’t know enough about what happened to answer that question definitively (or much of anything at all about Trump’s interactions with Ukraine, really). We now know more, though it’s often the case that the various details overlap and obscure one another. It has also been true that there have been gaps in what we know.

With the release of the House impeachment inquiry report Tuesday, a number of significant gaps have been filled. We now know, for example, when precisely the aid to Ukraine was stopped, necessary for understanding how Ukraine was viewing the constant push for Trump’s investigations. We know, too, how discussions of a possible White House meeting were repeatedly conflated with those investigations. We know how that evolved into a specific discussion of a public statement about the investigations and how that then became centered on an interview on CNN.

Using existing information and details from the report, we’ve created the following timeline articulating how those two main tracks — aid to Ukraine and the White House meeting — were or could have been used to pressure Ukraine into announcing the investigations Trump sought.

Three things happened on June 18 that shaped what followed.

AD

AD

One was fairly abstract. On that day, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had an encounter with National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill in which he declared that he was in charge of Ukraine policy. Taken aback, Hill asked him who had made that determination. Trump, Sondland replied, making explicit the secondary channel for Ukraine policy through which the apparent effort to pressure Zelensky would flow.

That same day, the Department of Defense announced $250 million in military aid to Ukraine, aid that had been approved by Congress months earlier. The next day, after having seen media coverage of the announcement, Trump began asking questions about the spending, according to the testimony of Office of Management and Budget official Mark Sandy. Sandy received a request for more information about the aid from a political appointee within OMB.

Meanwhile, the three officials (the “three amigos”) tasked by Trump in late May with leading policy on Ukraine — working with Trump’s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani — met at the Department of Energy. The three, Sondland, then-Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker and then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, discussed a Trump-Zelensky meeting at the White House. They were joined over the phone by acting Ukraine ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., who had begun work the previous day. Volker and Sondland would later inform Taylor that Trump “wanted to hear from Zelensky” before the meeting moved forward, an apparent reference to the investigations.

AD

AD

On June 27, Sondland was more explicit, telling Taylor that Zelensky needed to make clear to Trump that he wasn’t standing in the way of investigations.

The next day, Sondland, Taylor, Perry and Volker spoke with Zelensky by phone. David Holmes, an aide to Taylor in Kyiv, later testified that Zelensky was told that action on a Biden-related investigation was a precondition for a meeting at the White House. This appears to be the first point at which Ukraine was informed that a meeting was conditioned on investigations.

On July 2, Volker and Zelensky spoke again at an event in Toronto. There, Volker again linked a White House meeting to the investigations, referring to them as the “Giuliani factor.”

AD

The next day, July 3, government officials learned that congressional notification of the aid to Ukraine — a step in disbursing the funds — had been placed on hold. This was the first indicator that the aid would not move forward.

AD

A week later, on July 10, a number of members of the administration, including Sondland and Volker, met with Ukrainian officials at the White House. The Ukrainian delegation included Andriy Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, and Oleksandr Danyliuk, a top defense official. During two meetings, Sondland explicitly linked a White House meeting to the desired investigations, frustrating Hill and others present.

The halt to aid was formalized on July 12, according to the House report. It was announced broadly within the administration during a conference call on July 18, which is when staffers in Kyiv first learned about it. Over the rest of the month, there were a number of meetings in which stakeholders sought to move the aid forward, without success. When the Defense Department argued that it would need to begin disbursing funds by Aug. 6 to get them out the door by the end of the fiscal year, a deadline for the review (which OMB cited as the cause of the halt) was set for Aug. 6. That deadline, and several others, were missed.

AD

On July 19, Volker, Giuliani and Giuliani’s associate Lev Parnas had breakfast at Trump’s hotel in Washington. Volker later reported back to Sondland and Taylor that it was critical “for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation — and address any specific personnel issues — if there are any” in a conversation with Trump. Sondland spoke with Zelensky and conveyed that message, later reporting back on the conversation and its contents to Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

AD

The next day, Taylor had a conversation with Danyliuk in which the Ukrainian grumbled about his country being made into a pawn for the 2020 election.

Trump and Zelensky spoke for the first time on July 25. Trump asked Zelensky for the two investigations he sought, identifying the one related to the DNC hacking as being a favor he was requesting of Ukraine after Zelensky mentioned wanting to purchase military equipment. Before the call, Trump and Sondland spoke, with Sondland then asking Volker to send a message to Zelensky’s team: You’ll get the meeting if you agree to the probes. Zelensky agreed to the probes, and, afterward, Trump extended an invitation to the White House.

AD

That afternoon, staffers at the Defense Department received emails indicating that both Congress and Ukraine were to some extent aware of the hold on military aid. A former deputy foreign minister in Zelensky’s government told the New York Times this week that she knew with certainty by July 30. This is the clearest indication to date of when Ukraine knew about the aid freeze.

AD

The next day, July 26, Sondland and Volker held a number of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky and Yermak. Sondland testified that he believed he raised the investigations with Yermak in a one-on-one conversation. Later, he would call Trump and assure the president that the investigations were moving forward.

After their breakfast at Trump’s hotel, Volker had introduced Yermak to Giuliani, and the two of them set up a meeting in Madrid on Aug. 2. There, a new strategy emerged.

AD

“The Madrid meeting set off a ‘series of discussions’ among Mr. Giuliani, Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Sondland,” the report states, “about the need for President Zelensky to issue a public statement about the investigations into Burisma”— the company for which Biden’s son worked in Ukraine — “and the 2016 election conspiracy theory to secure a White House meeting with President Trump.”

AD

That desired statement became the focus of discussion between Sondland, Volker, Giuliani and Yermak for the early part of August. On Aug. 9, Sondland felt they were close, with Trump willing to set a date for the meeting because he really wanted the “deliverable” — that statement about the probes.

The next day, Aug. 10, Yermak proposed releasing the statement only after the date for a White House meeting was set, recognizing the inherent quid pro quo. It didn’t work. He sent a draft statement on Aug. 12, but it didn’t include specific mentions of the investigations Trump wanted to see.

Sondland, Volker and Giuliani agreed on revisions that included specific references to those probes and sent them to Yermak on Aug. 13. Yermak was hesitant, asking if there had been a formal request for an investigation made by the U.S. government. There hadn’t.

On Aug. 17, the group confirmed that they were still seeking a statement including the two probes. Ultimately, though, the statement was tabled, because Ukrainian officials were worried that including the specific probes would make it look as though they were playing politics. But Volker worried that Giuliani would consider the language too weak if the probes weren’t included. That Zelensky was planning to replace the prosecutor general added an additional layer of complication.

On Aug. 22, Sondland suggested to Pompeo that Trump and Zelensky meet when both were in Poland for a planned event the following month. Zelensky, he hoped, could tell Trump that he’d address the issue when the new team was in place, a conversation that he hoped could break “the logjam” with Zelensky’s team. Trump ended up not going because of Hurricane Dorian.

In the meantime, though, word of the halt in aid became public with a Politico article on Aug. 28. Yermak contacted Volker and Taylor on Aug. 29. As the State Department’s Catherine Croft testified, there was no reason for Ukraine to make the halt public, as it would send a message that U.S. support was softening. Once it was made public otherwise, the calculus apparently changed. That same day, Taylor sent a memo to Pompeo objecting to the halt in aid, a halt that he would soon connect to the desired investigations.

In Poland on Sept. 1, Sondland met with Yermak. Having come to the conclusion (without prompting, he testified) that aid was contingent on the desired investigations, he told Yermak that “the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.” Taylor, getting wind of the conversation, raised concerns with Sondland.

Holmes testified that Sondland’s assertion was probably redundant. Ukraine, having been pushed for months to announce new investigations and aware that aid was being withheld for no publicly stated reason, would independently have come to the same conclusion that Sondland did.

On Sept. 5, The Washington Post editorial board reported that it had learned that aid was being withheld to pressure Ukraine into launching an investigation focused on Biden.

Two days later, on Sept. 7, Trump and Sondland spoke, with the president denying a quid pro quo on aid but insisting that Zelensky announce the investigations. After speaking with Trump, Sondland “promptly” spoke to Zelensky, according to the report, at which point Zelensky agreed to announce the probes — in an interview with CNN later in the month.

On Sept. 9, Taylor again expressed concerns about tying aid to the announcement of new investigations. Sondland denied any quid pro quo, something he later testified was simply a recitation of what Trump had claimed. That same day, House Democrats announced an investigation into Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine and the hold on aid. On Sept. 11, Trump released the aid.

Ukraine appeared to still be planning to move forward with the CNN interview, however, despite concerns expressed by Taylor and others. On Sept. 13, Zelensky met with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, who was going to conduct the interview; as of then, it was still on. It was only several days later, on Sept. 18 or 19, that the interview was canceled.

By then, there was broad attention being paid to what happened in Ukraine. Within days, the administration released the rough transcript of the July 25 call in an effort to show that Trump had behaved properly and, in the president’s phrasing, that there had been no quid pro quo at stake."

A signal that impeachment will include Mueller?

The House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearings focused almost exclusively on Ukraine. That was the new information, after all, and that’s what the witnesses could speak to.

But at the start of Wednesday’s hearing, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) seemed to indicate he was inclined to include something else in the impeachment articles: the obstruction-of-justice portions of the Mueller investigation.

AD

AD

Nadler’s opening statement accused Trump of obstructing both the Ukraine probe and the Russia investigation, and it included plenty on the latter, in a way that suggests it was a calculated choice.

“When his own Justice Department tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws,” Nadler said of the Russia probe, “President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to obstruct the investigation, including ignoring subpoenas, ordering the creation of false records, and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses. Then, as now, this administration’s level of obstruction is without precedent.”

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III opted not to decide whether Trump had obstructed justice, given Justice Department guidelines that say a sitting president can’t be indicted. But there were five instances in which he suggested there was substantial evidence to support all three criteria for an obstruction charge.

The Washington Post’s Rachael Bade has written about how Democrats were quietly talking about including Mueller in the impeachment articles. Of course, just because Nadler may think that should be included doesn’t mean his fellow Democrats will agree.

Before the hearing began, the committee’s ranking Republican, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), was officially passed over for a Senate appointment by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who instead picked business executive Kelly Loeffler. Trump had wanted Collins, a fierce defender of the president, to get the seat.

And shortly thereafter, Collins was upbraided by one of the witnesses.

Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan noted she had worked with some of the Republicans on the committee, and then addressed Collins directly. She took exception to Collins suggesting the hearings weren’t about the underlying facts and were instead about a political vendetta.

AD

“And here, Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing, because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts,” Karlan said. “So I’m insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor, I don’t care about those facts.”

It was a level of combativeness that you rarely see from a witness. And it made Karlan an early focal point of this hearing.

AD

Later on, Karlan made a pointed comment about the powers the Constitution delegates to a president, noting that a key restriction was on titles of nobility.

“So while the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,” she said, drawing some laughter.

White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham charged that Karlan was using “a teenage boy who has nothing to do with this joke of a hearing (and deserves privacy) as a punchline.” First lady Melania Trump also weighed in.

A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) December 4, 2019

Karlan apologized later in the hearing. “I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the president’s son,” she said. “It was wrong of me to do that.” She added that she wished Trump would also apologize for the things he’s done wrong.

AD

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) used his time to criticize the comment as well. And he referred to past comments from Karlan in which she said liberals live closer together and that very conservative people tended to spread out, “perhaps because even they don’t want to be around themselves.” Gaetz suggested it showed Karlan’s contempt for conservatives; Karlan said she was merely making a point about how conservatives generally don’t want to live in crowded areas, even if their neighbors are like-minded.

Karlan once told The Washington Post that she would like to have been a Supreme Court justice — “but not enough to have trimmed my sails for half a lifetime.” That sensibility was certainly on display Wednesday.

3. A unique GOP witness — who won’t defend Trump the man

The GOP’s lone witness at the table on Wednesday, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, is a veteran of these hearings. As he noted in his opening statement, he also testified at President Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings.

AD

And Turley clearly came prepared. His opening statement numbered 53 pages — significantly longer than the other witnesses’ — and contained extensive, detailed footnotes.

Perhaps his strongest argument came at the top, when he said that he has very little regard for Trump, even as he doesn’t believe Trump should be impeached.

“First, I am not a supporter of President Trump. I voted against him in 2016 and I have previously voted for Presidents Clinton and Obama,” Turley said in his written statement. “Second, I have been highly critical of President Trump, his policies and his rhetoric, in dozens of columns. Third, I have repeatedly criticized his raising of the investigation of the Hunter Biden matter with the Ukrainian president.”

AD

AD

Turley even said, contradicting Trump, that Trump’s July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky “was anything but perfect.” He added in his written statement that Trump’s “reference to the Bidens was highly inappropriate.” He even admitted the House had a legitimate reason to investigate the Ukraine situation. But he said impeachment wasn’t warranted based on current evidence.

Turley’s advocacy for a president he doesn’t support was a noted contrast to the other three witnesses, all of whom, as the White House quickly noted, had publicly disparaged Trump in the past. Some suggested Democrats should have invited witnesses who didn’t appear so ideologically opposed to Trump.

1. Strong agree.

2. Not that it would've changed any votes...

3. But that's not the point of any of this.

4. Tactics + Strategy. If the Dems care about long-term norms or a clearly better framing for all their 2020 anxiety, they should have invited more @chkbal folks in addition. — Jed Shugerman (@jedshug) December 4, 2019

Turley argued in his briefer verbal statement that impeachment was not a remedy for political anger, nor was it likely to reduce it.

AD

AD

“I get it: You’re mad,” Turley said. “The president’s mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad. And Luna is a goldendoodle, and they don’t get mad.”

He added: “So we’re all mad. Where’s that taken us? Will [a] slipshod impeachment make us less mad, or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?”

Turley did give Democrats some arguments, though, including when he suggested if a Ukraine quid pro quo was directly tied to Trump, it could be impeachable.

“In fact, non-crimes have been part of past impeachments; it’s just that they’ve never gone up alone or primarily as the basis of impeachment,” Turley said. “That’s the problem here. If you prove a quid pro quo, then you might have an impeachable offense.”

AD

4. A curious argument against impeaching Trump

One argument Turley kept coming back to seemed to be one that Republicans will run with, even though it had some key flaws. He repeatedly suggested that this impeachment process would set a record for speed.

“Why do you want to set the record for the fastest impeachment?” he asked the Democrats on the panel. “Fast is not good for impeachment.”

The first issue with this is we’ve had only two impeachments — Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson — so it’s not like there’s a lot to compare it to.

But the second is that it doesn’t appear to be correct.

It has been 71 days since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that the House would begin impeachment proceedings. In the case of Bill Clinton, it was 75 days between the House authorizing the impeachment inquiry and actually impeaching Clinton. There were process differences that make them less directly comparable: The investigative work for Clinton’s impeachment was already done by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, which allowed for the actual impeachment process to move more quickly. And this time, the House waited a month before voting on formalizing the inquiry, though depositions began very quickly after Pelosi’s announcement.

The Johnson example is worse for Turley’s comparison. Johnson was actually impeached just three days after committing the offense for which he was impeached — the removal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Johnson removed Stanton on Feb. 21, 1868; he was impeached on Feb. 24; and then the House decided on the actual impeachment articles. It was sent to the Senate by March 4 — less than two weeks after the offense for which Johnson was impeached.

The more valid part of Turley’s argument was that the impeachment hearing is moving faster than the courts, which have become involved in settling the disputes between Congress and the White House. House investigators subpoenaed many executive branch officials and documents, and the White House blocked officials from testifying and didn’t turn over the requested documents, so Congress sued.

Turley pointed out that President Nixon resigned after a Supreme Court decision that found he had to turn over evidence. Turley pointed out that it lent legitimacy that two branches of government trumped the executive.

The issues with it notwithstanding, Republicans like Collins seized on Turley’s argument that the impeachment process is rushed.

Prof. Turley: “Proceeding to a vote on this incomplete record is a dangerous precedent to set for this country. Removing a sitting President is not supposed to be easy or fast. It is meant to be thorough and complete. This is neither.” — Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) December 4, 2019

5. Nadler under fire

Republicans seem to believe they could make an example of Nadler and use him to argue that this process isn’t fair.

From the outset, they made clear part of their goal Wednesday was to ruffle Nadler. Nadler earned criticism for his committee’s handling of a September hearing with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and Pelosi’s decision to begin the proceedings in the Intelligence Committee, chaired by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), wasn’t exactly a vote of confidence in Nadler.

Shortly after Nadler’s opening statement, Republicans began peppering him with parliamentary inquiries and made a motion to compel Schiff to testify. Democrats moved to table the motion, and Republicans forced a vote on it. They also asked whether the federal rules of evidence could be enforced in the hearing.

When the first witness, Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, began speaking, Republicans repeatedly asked to be recognized for motions. Nadler said such motions had to wait until after the witnesses’ opening statements. But they kept trying.

When Feldman finished, Republicans moved to postpone the hearing. Democrats again objected, and Republicans forced another roll-call vote."

“I knew they were hot and heavy on this Russian collusion thing, even though I knew 100 percent that it was false,” Giuliani recently told conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. “I said to myself, ‘Hallelujah.’ I’ve got what a defense lawyer always wants: I can go prove someone else committed this crime.”

Giuliani’s efforts to undermine the special counsel probe eventually snowballed into the current impeachment crisis gripping the capital — highlighting how the pressure Trump and his allies put on Ukraine originated as an effort to sow doubts about the Russia investigation.

AD

“All roads lead to Russia,” said Paul Rosenzweig, who served as a lawyer on then-independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s team in the 1990s, noting that the theories about Ukraine have been described by former U.S. officials as Russian propaganda.

AD

The direct connection between the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine pressure campaign, often lost as the administration has reeled from controversy to controversy, shows the deep imprint the Russia investigation has had on the president.

Ultimately, Mueller would find that Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign were “sweeping and systematic,” but that the evidence did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia.

AD

Still, Trump’s determination to undercut the special counsel’s findings was so great that, the very day after Mueller testified before Congress, the president appeared to solicit another country’s political help in a phone call to his Ukrainian counterpart.

In his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump described the Mueller investigation as “nonsense,” emphasizing that it was very important to get to the bottom of what really happened.

AD

“They say a lot of it started with Ukraine,” Trump said in the call, which sparked the original whistleblower complaint.

The echoes of the Russia investigation can also be seen in how Trump has responded to the Ukraine scandal. As he did with the Mueller probe, the president has sought to undermine the investigation’s legitimacy, refused to cooperate fully and publicly attacked witnesses.

AD

Democrats are now weighing whether to include Trump’s conduct during both investigations in articles of impeachment that will be considered by the House this month.

“What Trump learned was always punch back. Demonize everyone. Fight to the last drop. Do what you want — it’ll work out in the end,” Rosenzweig said.

Indeed, the president’s latest message has been resonating: In recent weeks, his allies have increasingly been touting Ukraine’s alleged involvement in 2016.

AD

“I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,” Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Intelligence officials have concluded that it was Russia that interfered in the campaign.

On Monday, Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.), the GOP chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC: “Every elected official in the Ukraine was for Hillary Clinton. Is that very different than the Russians being for Donald Trump?”

An early focus on Ukraine

Giuliani has repeatedly said the public does not appreciate the extent to which his work in Ukraine was driven by the Mueller investigation, rather than — as Democrats have alleged — as an effort to bolster Trump’s reelection in 2020.

While the impeachment inquiry has focused largely on the effort by Trump and his allies to seek damaging information about former vice president Joe Biden, Giuliani has noted that his Ukraine research began in late 2018, several months before Biden announced his presidential bid.

AD

AD

“The investigation I conducted concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption, was done solely as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges, that kept changing as one after another were disproved,” Giuliani tweeted last month.

The Ukraine theory had been floated early on by Manafort, recently released internal documents from Mueller’s investigation show.

In the summer of 2016, as Manafort faced building questions about lucrative lobbying work he did in Ukraine, he began to suggest to other Trump campaign aides that the Ukrainians might have been responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016, rather than the Russians, according to what his deputy, Rick Gates, told the FBI.

AD

Gates told investigators that Manafort’s comments attributing the hacks to Ukrainians “parroted a narrative” that was also advanced at the time by Konstantin Kilimnik, an employee of Manafort whom the FBI has assessed to have ties to Russian intelligence. (Kilimnik denies such ties.)

AD

As the special counsel investigation got underway in 2017, other Trump allies began promoting the alternative Ukraine theory.

In a text conversation with Manafort from August 2017 released by prosecutors, Fox News host Sean Hannity cited “Ukraine interference” as one of the issues he was highlighting to attack ­Mueller.

By early 2019, Giuliani began meeting with Ukrainian prosecutors. At the time, he and other Trump lawyers were bracing for the release of Mueller’s report and particularly what it would say about Manafort, who prosecutors said had breached his plea agreement by lying about key details of the 2016 campaign.

AD

Notes from Giuliani’s meetings, which were turned over to impeachment investigators, show he appeared to be gathering information that could help him argue that Manafort was set up when damaging information about his work as a political consultant in Ukraine had been published in 2016, forcing his ouster as Trump’s campaign chief.

AD

During this time, Giuliani has said, he consulted with Manafort — who was by then incarcerated — through his lawyer.

Giuliani was focused on the theory that the Ukrainian government interfered in the 2016 campaign through the activities of a Ukrainian American contract worker for the DNC, Alexandra Chalupa, which she has denied. This year, he met with a low-level Ukrainian diplomat who has alleged that officials at Ukraine’s embassy were feeding information about Manafort to Chalupa.

“I believed there was a lot of evidence that the [Democratic National Committee] and the Clinton campaign had a close connection to Ukrainian officials,” Giuliani told The Washington Post in October.

Giuliani said his consultation with Manafort also centered on trying to ascertain the veracity of a secret black ledger obtained by Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which the New York Times revealed in an August 2016 article. The Times said the ledger recorded $12.7 million in cash payments from then-President Viktor Yanukovych’s political party to Manafort.

AD

Giuliani suggested it was leaked by Ukrainians to hurt Trump — ignoring the widespread anger in Ukraine about the role Manafort played in helping elect Yanukovych, who was allied with Russia and fled to Moscow in 2014.

Manafort ultimately pleaded guilty to illegally routing $60 million in payments from his Ukraine clients through a series of offshore bank accounts and failing to pay taxes on about half the funds.

Serhiy Leshchenko, the Ukrainian journalist and former lawmaker who helped publicize the secret payments, has said he was motivated solely by a desire to hold Manafort and Yanukovych accountable.

“Giuliani’s entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts,” he wrote in an op-ed in The Post in September. He has denied allegations from Republicans that he provided the document to the Times.

Legal experts said Giuliani’s theories appeared to be aimed primarily at shaping public perception.

“It strikes me as less of a legal strategy than a public relations campaign to distract attention from the core operative facts,” said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who was involved with the early stages of the Russia investigation. “It is true that Mr. Giuliani is a lawyer. It does not mean that every endeavor he engages in involves providing legal services, rather than other types of services.”

However, Giuliani’s ideas strongly resonated with Trump, who has personally embraced the idea that Ukraine was the real culprit in 2016.

“They tried to take me down,” he told advisers in May, as The Post previously reported.

The president has even touted a debunked conspiracy theory that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which analyzed the DNC hacks, spirited the party’s server that was hacked to Ukraine.

“I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike. . . . I guess you have one of your wealthy people. . . . The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump told Zelensky. “There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.”

Trump told Zelensky he wanted to have Attorney General William P. Barr call Zelensky or his people and “get to the bottom of it.”

Former national security officials have expressed alarm at the traction of Giuliani’s theories on Ukraine, particularly the allegation about CrowdStrike.

“I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president,” former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said of Giuliani on ABC’s “This Week” in September. “It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again, and for clarity here . . . let me just again repeat that it has no validity.”

Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill testified last month that any action by Ukrainians to influence the 2016 vote in the United States was the work of individuals expressing policy views — rather than a ­government-led campaign of illegal acts like the one conducted by Russia.

“This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,” Hill said of the allegation that Ukraine also interfered in the election. “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016.”

Reprising tactics

Trump now appears to be applying the lessons of the special counsel experience to the congressional impeachment inquiry.

In the first probe, the president refused to be interviewed by prosecutors, but the White House did permit staff members to talk to investigators and turned over 20,000 pages of documents, exposing damaging information about Trump’s efforts to block the probe.

Most of the Mueller report’s second volume, which catalogues how Trump worked to undermine the investigation into his campaign, was built on the accounts of Trump’s own aides.

Still, Trump’s refusal to sit for an interview proved effective. Although the special counsel found that many of the written answers submitted by his lawyers as a substitute for an interview were “imprecise” or “inadequate,” Mueller chose not to issue a subpoena for his testimony, anticipating that it would lead to lengthy litigation.

The special counsel ultimately decided not to come to a conclusion as to whether Trump had broken the law by obstructing the probe. But, Mueller wrote, “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

This time around, Trump’s lawyers have decreed that there should be no cooperation with Congress at all. The White House has not turned over any documents to lawmakers and has directed key aides not to testify, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton.

Democrats in Congress now face the same difficult choice as Mueller — whether to allow their investigation to get bogged down by lengthy court battles to force cooperation or to push forward without additional evidence.

In another way, the president is reprising tactics he used in the special counsel probe, when he repeatedly attacked witnesses, comments Mueller said appeared intended to impede cooperation.

In recent weeks, Trump has heaped public scorn on officials who have chosen to testify before Congress, targeting former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, national security official Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and an aide to Vice President Pence who testified last month.

“It’s very intimidating,” Yovanovitch told members of Congress of Trump’s public attacks. “I can’t speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.”

And, as he did with the Mueller investigation, the president has kept up a nonstop series of attacks on the inquiry."

Hale’s statement’s echoed last month’s testimony by Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser on Russia, who dismissed claims of Ukrainian interference as “a fictional narrative” spun by Russian intelligence.

Republicans’ promotion of Trump’s Ukraine conspiracy theory is the latest example of their capitulation to him and of the GOP’s rapid transformation on Russia — from a party that for decades celebrated its hawkish stance toward the Kremlin to one that is reluctant to take a hard line and risk Trump’s wrath.

For some seasoned Republican foreign policy voices, the GOP’s refusal to back away from Trump’s position on supposed interference by Ukraine risks erasing values forged in the Cold War and defined for a generation by President Ronald Reagan’s prescient call for the Berlin Wall to come down.

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” said Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who has advised top Republicans on global affairs, said “it’s entirely a reflection of the political reality of where we are and the gravitational pull of President Trump and his singular hold over the Republican political establishment. … They don’t just ignore the Democrats but embrace alternative theories.”

There is also a growing view inside the GOP that the party’s core voters will not revolt if the party takes a softer position on Russia — a calculation backed by polling during Trump’s presidency. Gallup’s surveys, for instance, show that an expanding group of Republicans — 40 percent in July 2018 — now says Russia is a U.S. ally or is friendly, up from 22 percent in 2014, while “25 percent of Democrats say the same, little changed from 2014.”

“The base supports the president, and every Republican knows that — and they don’t think that this issue will rise high on the list of issues that matter to voters when they go to the polls,” said Republican consultant Michael Steel, who worked forJohn A. Boehner (R-Ohio) when Boehner was House speaker. “Whether what some of them are saying on Ukraine is consciously intellectually dishonest or not, they think the election will turn on jobs and the economy, not on Russia.”

Trump’s claims on Ukraine are part of the long list of incendiary conspiracy theories he has championed while paying little to no political cost within his own party, including questioning former president Barack Obama’s birthplace and patriotism, linking the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to John F. Kennedy’s assassination and alleging that Trump Tower was wiretapped during the 2016 campaign.

Many Senate Republicans who spoke with reporters around their weekly lunch Tuesday argued that the way Ukrainian officials spoke about the 2016 presidential campaign constituted interference on par with Russian interference — a position that is directly at odds with the conclusion of U.S. intelligence officials.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he saw evidence of Ukrainian “cheerleading” for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 that was “not insignificant.”

Even Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has drawn praise for his emphasis on bipartisan investigations, nodded this week toward Trump’s belief that Ukraine interfered.

“There’s no difference in the way Russia put their feet, early on, on the scale — being for one candidate and everybody called it meddling — and how the Ukrainian officials did it,” Burr said Tuesday.

Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), a vocal Trump ally, was among the first key lawmakers to state that they believed Ukraine’s conduct in 2016 was all but equivalent to Russian interference. But he has strained at times in doing so, pinballing from touting the claim to somewhat recanting to touting it again during a Sunday television interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where he claimed that Ukraine’s former president, Petro Poroshenko, “actively worked for Secretary Clinton” in 2016.

The inchoate and unproved nature of the Republican case against Ukraine has not prevented several GOP leaders from taking up the cause.

Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of GOP leadership who is close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), picked up directly on Kennedy’s argument this week, saying that Kennedy “has pointed out I think eight different stories” to show Ukraine and Russia “both meddled.”

Barrasso declined to elaborate on whether there was an equivalence between Russia’s covert 2016 election interference campaign and public statements made at the time by Ukrainian officials critical of Trump, who during the 2016 campaign had expressed a disdain for NATO and an interest in recognizing Crimea as Russia’s following the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian territory.

AD

When asked to define what he understood “meddling” to be, Barrasso said, “I’m not going to get in the middle of a fight that you want to have picked.”

AD

Such assessments appeared to confound some members of the GOP who serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Hale testified Tuesday that he was not aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) — the party’s 2012 presidential nominee and the informal standard-bearer for GOP hawks — was one of the few Republican lawmakers who stood by the assessment of U.S. officials. Romney famously declared in 2012 that Russia “is, without question, our number one geopolitical foe.”

AD

“I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” Romney told reporters Tuesday.

Romney added later, “Leaders of the countries are pulling for one candidate or another, that’s to be expected, but there’s a big difference between pulling for someone, hoping someone wins in the American election and interfering in the way Russia did.”

AD

Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) — who like Romney sits on the Foreign Relations Committee — said Tuesday that while “Russia meddled in the election,” he was “not aware of” evidence that Ukraine did.

AD

McConnell, meanwhile, declined to comment on the ongoing GOP debate over Ukraine and interference in the 2016 election.

“The intelligence committees have the ability to look at any of these suggestions,” he said at a news conference. “My view is that’s something for Senate Intelligence to take a look at it, and I don’t have a particular reaction to it.”

In other influential gathering places on the right, conservative media figures, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have been at the forefront of right-wing claims that Russian interference has been overstated by U.S. officials and the national political establishment, fueling the congressional Republican push to shrug off talk about Russian hostility.

AD

“It never happened. There was no collusion. Russia didn’t hack our democracy,” Carlson wrote on Fox News’s website Tuesday. “The whole thing was a talking point, a ludicrous talking point, invented by the Hillary Clinton campaign on or about November 9th, 2016 to explain their unexpected defeat in the last presidential election.”

That column by Carlson came hours after he said on his Monday broadcast that “I think we should probably take the side of Russia, if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine.”

Hill testified last month that while serving in the Trump White House and in the months since she left, she refused to be “part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine — not Russia — attacked us in 2016.”

“These fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes,” Hill said.

Putin has appeared to be amused by the turn of events in the United States. Speaking in Moscow last month, he said, “Thank God no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore. Now, they’re accusing Ukraine.”

Senate Democrats expressed alarm Tuesday as the Republicans chimed in along those lines; Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said in a floor speech that “by spreading the false and unsupported narrative that Ukraine — not just [Russian President Vladimir] Putin — was responsible for interfering in the 2016 elections, Republicans are endangering our democracy and empowering Vladimir Putin, at the same time.”

“Even wondering aloud about the debunked Ukrainian interference theory helps Putin muddy the waters and deflect the blame away from his country, which our intelligence services have all agreed — I think it’s seventeen of them — that he interfered in the election. He’s trying to create a diversion, and our Republican colleagues are going along,” Schumer said.

Veteran Democratic strategists see a possible opening for the party’s eventual nominee to win over some hawkish Republicans and independents who are wary of the Republican drift on Russia.

Throughout the campaign season, most Democratic presidential candidates have spoken sharply of Russia, calling out its election interference and defending what former vice president Joe Biden has called the “liberal international order.”

“The responsible position is to recognize that Russia is a force one has to reckon with, but certainly not a force to embrace,” said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama. “Among ‘Never Trump’ Republicans, you could see it as a huge, animating factor next year because they tend to be neocons who are strongly anti-Russia.”

Axelrod added that the GOP shift on Russia is among a number of “stunning Republican changes, from being the free-trade party to the tariff party, from a pro-immigration party to anti-immigration” that could have an impact on next year’s election.

But Democrats have been grappling with figures within their ranks whose foreign-policy rhetoric is skeptical of the political establishment and has elements of Trump’s worldview, highlighting that the party’s positioning is far from universally hawkish and that Democrats face their own turbulence on foreign policy.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a presidential candidate, has argued in favor of a noninterventionist U.S. foreign policy in Syria and elsewhere and has been favorably covered by the Kremlin-backed news agency RT. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton claimed in October that Gabbard was the “favorite of the Russians,” drawing quick criticism from Gabbard."

The Investigations

WE READ THE 300 PAGE REPORT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO: Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee laid out an extensive case that President Trump abused the powers of the presidency by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations into his political opponents — compromising America's national security for his personal gain.

Democrats not only meticulously outlined Trump's alleged misconduct — based on “two months of testimony from diplomats and administration officials, in addition to call records and other evidence discovered by the committees” — but said a “campaign to conceal his conduct from the public"" amounts to obstruction.

A watershed moment: The House intelligence Committee approved the report in a partisan 13-to-9 vote on Tuesday night, sending it to the Judiciary Committee. The document will serve as an outline for Democrats on that panel, which is responsible for drafting articles of impeachment against Trump.

The next phase of the impeachment inquiry begins today at 10 a.m.: Judiciary will host law experts to speak about the constitutional grounds for impeachment as the panel determines whether Trump's actions constitute high crimes and misdemeanors.

In the meantime, here's what you need to know from the report:

1. Democrats laid out eight different episodes of how Trump propelled a ""scheme"" to condition a White House meeting and $400 million in military aid to Ukraine upon a public announcement by its government of investigations that would help his reelection campaign.

The core of Democrats' case is this alleged quid pro quo for probes of of vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, according to our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, and Seung Min Kim.

for probes of of vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, according to our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, and Seung Min Kim. The report doesn't mince words on how this is an abuse of power: “President Trump used the power of the Office of the President and exercised his authority over the executive branch, including his control of the instruments of the federal government, to apply increasing pressure on the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically-motivated investigations desired by President Trump.”

“President Trump used the power of the Office of the President and exercised his authority over the executive branch, including his control of the instruments of the federal government, to apply increasing pressure on the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically-motivated investigations desired by President Trump.” From the Democrats: “The President’s actions have damaged our national security, undermined the integrity of the next election, and violated his oath of office,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), whose panels have overseen the inquiry, said in a statement to our colleagues.

2. Democrats are at least preparing to accuse Trump of obstructing Congress, though the report does not outline the specific articles of impeachment the president could face. The report found that a dozen witnesses “followed President Trump’s orders, defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify.”

“This allegation is an entire section of the report, encompassing more than 50 pages. Democrats point out that an article of impeachment drawn up against Richard M. Nixon was for his failure to comply with subpoenas,” our colleague Amber Philips reports.

Dems allege Trump's obstruction is unprecedented: “Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiries — including Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton — acknowledged Congress’ authority to investigate and, to varying degrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas​​​​​,” according to the report.

“Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiries — including Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton — acknowledged Congress’ authority to investigate and, to varying degrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas​​​​​,” according to the report. And will cause serious harm to U.S. democracy: “The damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the president’s ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked,” the report concludes. “Any future president will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three.”

3. Whether House Democrats will impeach Trump for “bribery” is still an unknown.

From Karoun : “The document concluded that Trump and his subordinates 'conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, on politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump’s domestic political opponent.' But it stopped short of recommending that Trump be impeached for what Schiff said those words constitute: bribery, which is one of the premises upon which the Constitution says Congress may remove a president from office.”

“The document concluded that Trump and his subordinates 'conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, on politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump’s domestic political opponent.' Schiff told Karoun in an interview ""that’s exactly what’s gone on here"" -- though it's up to Judiciary to recommend impeaching Trump on bribery: “This is certainly, I think, what the founders had in mind when they used that word in the Constitution.""

4. Call records show extensive contact between Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and the White House during key moments of the Ukraine episode.

""The call records provide powerful circumstantial evidence that Giuliani was coordinating with the White House on his Ukraine gambit, something Giuliani has previously acknowledged. The records also show contact between a Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, and one of Trump’s key defenders in Congress, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.),"" our colleagues Paul Sonne, Rosalind Helderman, and Greg Miller report.

As just one example: ""The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and [Zelensky] that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and '-1' on Aug. 8. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, is also simultaneously serving as the acting White House chief of staff.""

Who is the owner of the '-1' phone line?: ""Investigators are trying to determine whether the unidentified phone number belongs to Mr. Trump, said [Schiff]. If so, the phone calls with Mr. Giuliani could be further evidence of the president’s direct involvement in the Ukraine affair,"" the New York Times's Sharon LaFraniere and Julian Barnes report.

""Investigators are trying to determine whether the unidentified phone number belongs to Mr. Trump, said [Schiff]. the New York Times's Sharon LaFraniere and Julian Barnes report. AT&T and Verizon were likely subpoenaed: As our colleagues note, the report attributes the phone records to “document production” from the companies. ""The report doesn’t say whose phone records were subpoenaed, but the text suggests the committee obtained extensive records of calls by Giuliani and Parnas.""

5. Democrats say Trump's pattern of behavior requires urgent action the president potentially solicits another foreign government for help in the 2020 election:

First it was Russia, then Ukraine: “Democrats tried to place Mr. Trump’s conduct in a broader context of wrongdoing that they said dated to the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump, they argued, first accepted help from one foreign power, Russia, to win the presidency, and then turned around and tried to enlist another, Ukraine, to bolster his 2020 reelection campaign,” the New York Times' Michael Shear and Nick Fandos report.

Mr. Trump, they argued, first accepted help from one foreign power, Russia, to win the presidency, and then turned around and tried to enlist another, Ukraine, to bolster his 2020 reelection campaign,” the New York Times' Michael Shear and Nick Fandos report. And take China as another example: The report notes that “on October 3, 2019, even as our Committee was engaged in this inquiry, President Trump publicly declared anew that other countries should open investigations into his chief political rival, saying, 'China should start an investigation into the Bidens,' and that 'President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.'”

6. There could be more to come: Former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration Neal Katyal tweeted that the most important language is in the first sentence of the report.

“The Committee Report details the evidence gathered 'THUS FAR.' They are clearly laying down a marker that the investigation continues and that the President is bent on obstructing it/trying to gag [executive branch] employees from telling the truth,” he added.

7. The report is likely to do little to sway Trump's Republican allies on the Hill, who released a draft of their own 123-page counter-report yesterday.

From the White House: “Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,” press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. “Chairman Schiff’s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.”

On The Hill

HAPPENING TODAY: The Judiciary hearing today will feature “some of Capitol Hill’s most aggressive and colorful characters — Republicans and Democrats,” our colleagues Elise Viebeck, Mike DeBonis, and Rachael Bade report.

What to watch: “There could be disruptions from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) … There could be conspiracy theories from Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) … And there could be antics from Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a vocal Trump critic who brought a bucket of fried chicken to a hearing in May to highlight the absence of Attorney General William P. Barr, who was scheduled to testify.""

“It’s a bunch of brawlers sometimes on the Judiciary Committee, so it should get pretty hot under the collar as we go along,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the panel, said on Fox News over the weekend.

Nadler used an expletive in a closed-door meeting to state clearly he was not going to put up with antics on either side of the aisle. From Politico's Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris: ""[The] rare cuss word from the lawyerly Manhattan Democrat that prompted some lawmakers to sit up in their chairs, according to multiple people in the room.”

All eyes will be on Nadler: “Nadler’s warning shot referred to likely GOP antics to try to undermine the first impeachment hearing in the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. But it wasn’t lost on Democrats that Nadler’s message could also apply to those in his own party who have closely scrutinized his role in the House's impeachment probe,” per Caygle and Ferris.

Leading the impeachment fight for Republicans: Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.). ""Known as a Southern spitfire among his colleagues, [he] steered the GOP through several rowdy Judiciary hearings related to the Russia probe earlier this year,"" Politico's Melanie Zanona reports. ""During the impeachment proceedings, Collins and his band of Republicans on the panel are expected to hammer Democrats over their process and the breakneck pace of their impeachment probe.""

Collins's star turn comes at a crucial time: Georgia will soon have an open Senate seat after Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson retires at the end of the year. Trump favors Collins to be appointed to the chamber, but the state's Gov. Brian Kemp is expected to tap business executive Kelly Loeffler instead, our colleague Seung Min Kim reported. Regardless, Collins will still be on national T.V. today defending the president, which could also further stoke the intraparty fight over the appointment.

The People

GOP TURNS TO DEBUNKED CONSPIRACY TO DEFEND TRUMP: A number of Republican lawmakers are pressing ahead with debunked claims about Ukraine as they defend Trump based on conspiracy theories that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has helped spread, our colleagues Robert Costa and Karoun Demirjian report.

Key quote from a seasoned GOP foreign policy figure: “Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission told our colleagues. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission told our colleagues. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.” They're led by Sen. John Kennedy (La.), who is known for his folksy idioms and easy access to the press, though even he appeared to grow tired of talking about the subject, according to a Politico report.

The claims that seek to cast blame on Kyiv rather than Moscow for interfering in the 2016 election are debunked: We’re repeating this for the people in the back.

If you want to dive further into the subject: There have been multiple detailed fact checks, including by our colleague Glenn Kessler who wrote there were “not enough Pinocchios” for one particular debunked theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s emails. David Hale, the No. 3 official at the State Department, also testified that he is not aware of any evidence Ukraine meddled in the election.

There have been multiple detailed fact checks, including by our colleague Glenn Kessler who wrote there were “not enough Pinocchios” for one particular debunked theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s emails. David Hale, the No. 3 official at the State Department, also testified that he is not aware of any evidence Ukraine meddled in the election. What is happening: Russia is actively trying to interfere in the 2020 election, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified in July and Hale reiterated yesterday.

Some GOP members have had enough: “I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham said the strategy is hurting Trump: “It was the Russians. I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the DNC was by Russian operatives, no one else,” the South Carolina senator told reporters on Capitol Hill, CNN’s Phil Mattingly and Chandelis Duster report.

The Campaign

HARRIS IS OUT: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) “proved an uneven campaigner and was ultimately engulfed by low polling numbers, internal turmoil and a sense that she was unable to provide a clear message amid the roiling, impassioned politics of the moment,” our colleague Chelsea Janes writes in The Post’s postmortem.

Other possible implications: “The most diverse primary field in U.S. history is now one that may well be represented in its December debate by four white men and two white women,” our colleague Philip Bump writes.

A number of activists are concerned about the very real prospect of this happening:

No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic.

Cory Booker (N.J.) has met the donor threshold, but has yet to secure a single qualifying poll.

TRUMP MEETS WITH JOHNSON: “Boris Johnson and [Trump] snuck in a quick private meeting Tuesday evening with little fanfare ahead of a NATO leaders' meeting in London Wednesday,” Politico Europe's Emilio Casalicchio reports.

Why the hush-hush?: “Johnson wants to avoid appearing too close to his U.S. counterpart, who is deeply unpopular in Britain, for fear it could scupper his chances in the country's general election next week,” Politico reports. “That could explain why the meeting was not announced in advance.”

Trump seemed to get this telling reporters “I'll stay out of the election,” but shortly thereafter added “I think Boris is very capable and I think he'll do a good job.” Though those words are a far cry from July when Trump said people called Johnson “Britain's Trump.”

The discord could be the prelude to a major fissure within federal law enforcement on the controversial question of investigating a presidential campaign.

Barr has not been swayed by Horowitz’s rationale for concluding that the FBI had sufficient basis to open an investigation on July 31, 2016, these people said.

AD

AD

Barr’s public defenses of President Trump, including his assertion that intelligence agents spied on the Trump campaign, have led Democrats to accuse him of acting like the president’s personal attorney and eroding the independence of the Justice Department. But Trump and his Republican allies have cheered Barr’s skepticism of the Russia investigation.

It’s not yet clear how Barr plans to make his objection to Horowitz’s conclusion known. The inspector general report, currently in draft form, is being finalized after input from various witnesses and offices that were scrutinized by the inspector general. Barr or a senior Justice Department official could submit a formal letter as part of that process, which would then be included in the final report. It is standard practice for every inspector general report to include a written response from the department. Barr could forgo a written rebuttal on that specific point and just publicly state his concerns.

Spokespeople for the inspector general and the FBI declined to comment.

AD

AD

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement that the inspector general investigation “is a credit to the Department of Justice. His excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves. Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the Inspector General’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters.”

The Russia investigation was opened after the FBI was told of statements made by a then Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, that the Russians possessed hacked Hillary Clinton emails. Papadopoulos’s alleged comments were key because they were made well before any public allegation that Russian intelligence operatives had hacked the Democratic National Committee.

The attorney general has privately contended that Horowitz does not have enough information to reach the conclusion the FBI had enough details in hand at the time to justify opening such a probe. He argues that other U.S. agencies, such as the CIA, may hold significant information that could alter Horo­witz’s conclusion on that point, according to the people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

AD

AD

Barr has also praised the inspector general’s overall work on the matter, according to one person familiar with the matter. The inspector general operates independently of Justice Department leadership, so Barr cannot order Horowitz to change his findings.

But the prospect of the nation’s top law enforcement official suggesting the FBI may have wrongly opened an investigation into a presidential campaign, even after the inspector general announces the agency was justified in doing so, will probably generate more partisan battles over how the Justice Department and the FBI operate.

It is not unusual for an attorney general or the Justice Department to disagree with some of an inspector general’s findings. However, typically those disagreements occur because senior leaders at the department believe the inspector general has been too critical. In this case, Barr has conveyed to others his belief that Horowitz has not been critical enough, or is at least reaching a conclusion prematurely.

AD

AD

People familiar with the draft language of Horowitz’s report said that while it is critical of some FBI employees, and found some systemic problems in surveillance procedures, it overall does not agree with Trump’s charge that the investigation was a “witch hunt” or a politically motivated attack on him first as a candidate and then as president.

Instead, the draft report found that the investigation was opened on a solid legal and factual footing, these people said.

Part of Barr’s reluctance to accept that finding is related to another investigation, one being conducted by the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, John Durham, into how intelligence agencies pursued allegations of Russian election tampering in 2016. Barr has traveled abroad to personally ask foreign officials to assist Durham in that work. Even as the inspector general’s review is ending, Durham’s investigation continues.

AD

AD

Barr’s disagreement with Horowitz will probably spark further criticism from Democrats, who have already accused Barr of using his position to protect the president and undermine federal law enforcement.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) charged in September that Barr had “gone rogue.”

In recent weeks, Democrats have charged that Barr’s Justice Department was too quick to decide not to investigate Trump over his efforts to persuade Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to announce an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The Ukraine controversy has led to an impeachment inquiry.

Criticism of Barr previously centered on his handling of the Russia investigation. The case that began in 2016 was taken over in May 2017 by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. After a nearly two-year investigation, Mueller filed a lengthy report of his findings to Barr, by which point he had charged 34 people with crimes, including 26 Russian nationals. Those charged and convicted included Trump’s former campaign chairman, former personal attorney, former deputy campaign chairman and former national security adviser.

AD

AD

After receiving the Mueller report, Barr released a short letter summing up its main points, including that there was insufficient evidence to accuse any Trump associates of conspiring with the Russians. Barr also said Mueller had made no determination about whether Trump had sought to obstruct the investigation, but Barr and his then deputy concluded he had not.

When the full report was released, Democrats protested that Barr had improperly skewed the findings to be more favorable to Trump.

Barr has dismissed such criticism, and charged it is Democrats who are abusing legal procedures and standards in their quest to drive Trump out of the White House.

AD

“In waging a scorched-earth, no-holds-barred war against this administration, it is the left that is engaged in shredding norms and undermining the rule of law,” Barr said in a speech last month.

AD

In his first months on the job this year, Barr made clear he had serious concerns about how the FBI had conducted the investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

The attorney general declared in April that the Trump campaign was spied on, though aides later said he used that term not in a pejorative sense but in the more general meaning of surveillance.

“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told lawmakers. “I think spying did occur, but the question is whether it was adequately predicated and I’m not suggesting it wasn’t adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.” He also criticized former leaders of the FBI, saying, “I think there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there in the upper echelon.”

AD

Current and former law enforcement officials have said that, when presented with information about a possible plot to undermine the U.S. election, they had a duty to investigate, and that it would have been wrong not to have launched an investigation.

AD

In the months since, Barr, through Durham, has pursued information related to a onetime associate of Papadopoulos, a European academic named Joseph Mifsud.

Mifsud was publicly linked to Russian interference efforts in late 2017, when Mueller revealed Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the details of his interactions with Mifsud.

Shortly after his name surfaced publicly, Mifsud told Italian media he did not work for Russia. “I never got any money from the Russians: my conscience is clear,” Mifsud told La Repubblica. “I am not a secret agent.”"

Giuliani’s phone records include calls with a number designated only as “-1,” sometimes close in time to calls between Giuliani and the White House switchboard. The suggestion is that “-1” might be a phone belonging to Trump, though the report does not state that clearly.

AD

AD

Schiff, speaking to the Los Angeles Times, said he suspects the number could be Trump’s and that the committee is trying to find out whether calls logged as “-1” indeed came from the president.

A lawyer for Giuliani declined to comment.

The records show that Giuliani made several calls to the White House on April 24, the same day that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was summoned to Washington and told that she had lost Trump’s confidence. Giuliani called the White House at least seven times that day between 7:47 a.m. and 8:09 p.m. He also received a call from a White House number and spent more than eight minutes on the line with “-1.”

AD

The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and “-1” on Aug. 8.

AD

Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, is also simultaneously serving as the acting White House chief of staff.

The report uses the phone records to bolster evidence that Giuliani, his associates and “one or more individuals from the White House” coordinated a smear campaign against former vice president Joe Biden.

AD

In the weeks leading up to Biden’s April 25 announcement that he would seek the presidency, the logs show contacts between Giuliani, Parnas and John Solomon, then a conservative columnist for the Hill newspaper.

On the day that Biden announced his campaign, Solomon published a piece alleging that Ukraine had planted Russia collusion allegations against the Trump campaign. The column also described Biden’s efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor and questioned whether Biden had acted to protect his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company facing an investigation, as the fired prosecutor has alleged. No evidence has surfaced backing the prosecutor’s claim.

AD

At 7:14 p.m. that evening, Giuliani received a call from “-1” that lasted nearly five minutes. Moments later, according to the records, Giuliani spoke to Fox News host Sean Hannity for 36 seconds. Later that night, Trump was a guest on Hannity’s show. The Fox News host asked Trump to respond to Solomon’s latest column.

AD

Trump said, “that sounds like big, big stuff. I’m not surprised.”

The call records also show a number of phone calls between Nunes and Giuliani and between Nunes and Parnas earlier this year. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, has accused Nunes and his staff of participating in Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.

Call records also show that on May 10, as Giuliani came under fire for a planned trip to Ukraine to meet Zelensky, the former New York mayor began trading missed calls with Kash Patel, an official at the White House National Security Council who previously worked for Nunes.

AD

In the afternoon, after the aborted calls, Giuliani and Patel managed to connect and spoke for over 25 minutes, according to the report. Five minutes later, Giuliani connected with “-1” for more than 17 minutes.

AD

Patel has denied news reports — based in part on the closed-door testimony from Fiona Hill, former top Russia adviser on the National Security Council — that he was serving as a back-channel to Trump on Ukraine issues.

“At no time have I ever communicated with the president on any matters involving Ukraine,” Patel said earlier this year in a statement to Axios. “Any reporting to the contrary, and any testimony provided to Congress, is simply false, and any current or former staff who suggest I have raised or discussed Ukraine matters with President Trump, are similarly misinformed or spreading outright falsehoods.”

AD

The report Tuesday doesn’t detail any communications between Patel and Trump regarding Ukraine. It does say that he was talking to Giuliani right at the moment when Ukraine was at the top of the former New York mayor’s agenda.



AD

After his call with Patel and “-1,” Giuliani went on Fox News and said that he would be canceling his trip to Ukraine, because Zelensky was surrounded by “enemies of the president.”

A spokesman for the National Security Council didn’t respond to a request for comment regarding Patel’s call. Nunes, speaking on Tuesday to Hannity on Fox News, said he has known Giuliani for a long time and spoke with him about Robert S. Mueller III’s probe. Nunes said he didn’t really recall the name Parnas but it was possible he had spoken to him and needed to check his phone records. “But it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people,” Nunes said.

AD

Another Parnas lawyer, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., reiterated that, “with appropriate protections,” his client would fill in the blanks for lawmakers on the content of the calls. “All phone records show you is that a phone call was made,” he said. “It takes a participant in the phone call to tell you what was said.”

AD

It is unlikely Parnas will actually testify. Parnas is seeking immunity from Congress before talking to lawmakers. Such a move could complicate the campaign finance charges against him in federal court in New York, and lawmakers rarely take such a step without the blessing of the Justice Department. He has denied wrongdoing.

“I think that’s insulting to a lot of different forces,” said Trump. “It’s very disrespectful.” But the president himself has questioned whether the alliance has become “obsolete,” and he accused NATO members anew of shirking national commitments on military spending.

Hours later, Macron and Trump sat side by side for a media session, and Macron said he stood by his comments about the health of the NATO alliance. He also firmly expressed his frustration that Trump withdrew hundreds of American troops from Syria in October

The U.S. president bantered with reporters for more than two hours Tuesday, sitting casually in a salon of Winfield House, the manicured estate of the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, where he also met with fellow NATO leaders.

He slammed the ongoing Democratic-led impeachment inquiry back in the United States as a “”hoax” and professed to be unconcerned about declines in the stock market spurred by his remark that a trade deal with China might not materialize until after the 2020 election.

AD

Trump later called on Prince Charles and his wife Camilla and attended a NATO welcome reception at Buckingham Palace, before proceeding to an event at the prime minister’s residence at Number 10 Downing Street. Trump punctuated the day of diplomacy with a fundraiser for his reelection effort that his campaign said brought in $3 million.

AD

The gathering of NATO leaders follows Trump’s frequent criticism of alliance members as falling well short in doing their financial part through the first three years of his presidency.

After a NATO summit last year, he called for members devote at least 4% of gross domestic product to military spending and took aim at German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he accused of paying Russia ‘”billions of dollars for gas and energy” while failing to meet her nation’s commitment to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense.

AD

But at this NATO meeting, Trump — who heads toward an election year looking to showcase foreign policy wins — is offering a more optimistic outlook for the alliance’s future. To that end, he suggested he deserved much of the credit for progress.

“I don’t think frankly before us that NATO was changing at all, and NATO is really changing right now,” Trump said as he sat down for a one-on-one talk with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.

AD

White House officials say that before Trump took office just four NATO members had reached the 2% benchmark set in 2014. Now there are nine, Eighteen of the 29 are projected to meet it by 2024.

Stoltenberg said that Trump does deserve credit for nudging members.

AD

“The reality is that, not least because it has been so clearly conveyed from President Trump that we need fair burden sharing, allies are stepping up,” Stoltenberg said.

In his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump gently ribbed the premier — whose country is spending about 1.3% of GDP on defense — as “slightly delinquent.”

“Some are major delinquent,” said Trump. He added that he’s looking at the possibility of imposing unspecified trade penalties against NATO allies that perpetually fall below benchmarks.

“Some are way below 1 percent and that’s unacceptable, and then if something happens we’re supposed to protect them and it’s not really fair and it never has been fair,” he said.

AD

Trump’s talks with Macron were tense at times.

Before meeting with him on the sidelines of the summit, Trump laced into the French president for what he called “very, very nasty” comments in The Economist about NATO’s health with Trump leading its most important member.

Macron didn’t back down when they appeared later in the day, and he renewed his own criticism of Trump for withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria.

That decision by Trump, made without consulting France or other NATO allies, gave Turkey, another NATO member, a green light to launch operations against Syrian Kurdish forces who played a key role in the fight to clear a huge swath of Syria of the Islamic State.

AD

Trump and Macron have had an up-and-down relationship in the nearly three years Trump’s been in office.

Macron, who early in Trump’s presidency had looked to cultivate a close relationship, hosted Trump in 2017 for Bastille Day celebrations in Paris. Trump reciprocated by honoring Macron last year with the first state visit of a foreign leader during his time in the White House.

AD

As they answered questions from reporters, the new stress was most apparent as they discussed their concerns over Turkey’s plan to purchase an anti-aircraft missile system from Russia.

Macron said there is a disconnect in allowing Turkey to buy the system from Russia and also be a NATO member. Trump said he is weighing issuing sanctions against Ankara if it moves forward with plans to buy the weapons.

AD

Ahead of the meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would oppose a NATO plan to defend the Baltic region if the alliance does not back Turkey in its fight against Kurdish groups it considers terrorists.

“I’m sorry to say we don’t have the same definition of terrorism around the table,” Macron said in a swipe at Turkey.

Trump showed more deference to Erdogan, saying that Turkey was “very helpful” during the October U.S. commando raid that led to the death IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi near the Syria-Turkey border.

AD

“We flew over areas that were totally controlled by Turkey and Turkish military,” Trump said. “We didn’t tell them what we were doing or where we were going. Turkey could not have been nicer, could not have been more supportive.”

AD

At another point in their extended comments before the news media, Trump and Macron had a curt exchange about the repatriation of Islamic State fighters who are European citizens and were captured in Syria and Iraq in recent years. Trump has pressed unsuccessfully for European nations to accept fighters captured by U.S. forces.

“Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you,” Trump said. “You can take every one you want.”

“Let’s be serious,” Macron responded. “Your number one problem are not the foreign fighters.’’

Trump retorted, “’That’s one of the greatest non-answers I’ve ever heard. And, that’s OK.”

AD

After such exchanges, however, Trump gave Macron, along with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a ride in his armored presidential limo from the queen’s reception at Buckingham Palace to another gathering hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at No. 10 Downing St.

Trump, looking to showcase foreign policy wins as he heads into an election year, offered a more optimistic outlook for NATOs future. He took credit for boosting the share of NATO nations that are meeting the alliance’s goal of spending 2% of gross domestic on defense and sought to pressure more countries to increase their military budgets. But he also put a spotlight on his administration’s lingering to-do list: ending a China trade war he instigated, passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement as well as trade deals with the European Union and Britain.

A day after Trudeau was overheard gossiping about Trump during a reception at Buckingham Palace, Trump called the Canadian leader “two-faced.” In an unguarded conversation, Trudeau told leaders, including Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that “he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top,” an apparent reference to Trump’s long and unscheduled question-and-answer session with journalists earlier that day. Trudeau also said, seemingly about his meeting with Trump: “You just watched his team’s jaws drop to the floor.”

Trump fired back during a Wednesday afternoon meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He suggested that the Canadian’s overheard comments were precipitated by Trump’s decision to highlight the fact that Canada falls short of NATO goals on defense spending.

“The truth is that I called him out on the fact that he’s not paying 2% and I guess he’s not very happy about it,” Trump said. Later, seeming to relish the spat, Trump remarked “That was funny when I said that guy was two-faced.”

Relations between Trump and Macron, once the American president’s closest European ally, deteriorated a day earlier in feisty exchanges on live television.

First, Trump laced into the French president for what he called “very, very nasty” comments by Macron, who had lamented NATO’s “brain death” under Trump’s leadership of the U.S. Then, in a later meeting on the sidelines of the summit, Macron rebuked Trump over his insistence that Europe repatriate its citizens who fought with the Islamic State group, as well as his unilateral decision to withdraw American troops from northeast Syria.

Trump’s shift on Syria had cleared the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had been allied with the west in the fight against IS militants. There was more disagreement between Trump and European leaders over Turkey. Macron, in particular, wanted the alliance to do more to confront Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over his incursion into Syria and his purchase of Russian surface-to-air missiles.

On Wednesday, Trump falsely claimed that Macron had taken back his comments about NATO’s “brain death,” even though the French leader said he stood by them.

It was far from the only inconsistency highlighted during two days of summitry.

AD

Trump, who has celebrated every new stock market high, claimed that he didn’t pay too much heed to the market after stocks tumbled following his remarks that a China trade deal may not come until after Election Day. He also claimed that it was his decision not to more quickly reach an agreement with China, as relations have soured over U.S. support for pro-Democracy protests in Hong Kong. Previously, Trump had said that it was China that would rather wait for the election results.

AD

Trump also declared NATO to be the healthiest it’s ever been even as the alliance is grappling with fundamental questions about its funding and whether its requirement for mutual defense still makes sense as it confronts threats that now extend beyond Russia to a rising China and international terrorism.

Trump has resisted some European efforts to put more pressure on Erdogan, whom he met with on the sidelines of the summit. The president praised the Turkish leader despite widespread calls in Washington and Europe for the Turkish government to suffer consequences for its actions in Syria and decision to buy the Russian air defense system.

AD

The president abruptly canceled a news conference that would have played out at the same time as the impeachment hearing in Washington. But he insisted he’s unconcerned about the inquiry, with Democrats facing a mountainous climb to remove Trump from office. While Democrats hold the majority in the House, Republicans control the Senate and not one GOP lawmaker in the upper chamber has signaled support for ousting Trump. An impeachment conviction in the Senate would require 67 votes out of 100.

AD

Still, Trump lashed out at Democratic lawmakers for scheduling the hearing while he was overseas and predicted low ratings for testimony from constitutional experts.

“These people, you almost question whether or not they love our country,” Trump said of the Democrats.

AD

Democrats argue that Trump acted improperly when he pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s dealings in the eastern European nation. Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.

During his meeting with Merkel, Trump told reporters he didn’t know why his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was speaking with the White House Office of Management and Budget — a revelation that was included in phone records published in the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment report.

AD

“I really don’t know,” he said. Trump encouraged reporters to ask Giuliani about the calls, but insisted they are “no big deal.”

AD

Trump has frequently criticized NATO members for falling well short in doing their financial part through the first three years of his presidency, and he was eager to take credit for recent increases in defense spending by alliance members.

At this year’s summit, he told reporters: “I don’t think, frankly, before us, that NATO was changing at all, and NATO is really changing right now.’’

But while NATO leaders emphasized unity, Trump convened his own sub-group of the alliance — limited to only those who had met the defense spending target.

THE BIG IDEA: Research experiments conducted by social scientists help illustrate why it’s so insidious for President Trump and his congressional defenders to keep parroting the debunked conspiracy theory, which originated with Russian intelligence agencies, that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.

People who are repeatedly exposed to the same false information, even if they’re initially told that it is false, feel fewer qualms sharing it on social media after each additional time they see it. In five experiments involving more than 2,500 Americans, Daniel Effron, who teaches organizational behavior at the London Business School, and Medha Raj, a PhD student at the University of Southern California, documented how seeing a fake headline just once leads individuals to temper their disapproval of the misinformation when they see it a second, third or fourth time. They outline their findings in the new edition of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

The researchers asked online survey participants to rate how unethical or acceptable they thought it would be to publish a fake headline, and how likely they would be to like, share, block or unfollow the person who posted it. Participants were much more prone to “like” or share headlines they’d seen previously and less likely to block or unfollow the person who posted them, even if they were warned the information was false. The results shows a tendency of humans to misremember false headlines as true because they’ve seen them before. The researchers argue that repeating misinformation in the echo chamber of something like social media lends it a “ring of truthfulness” that can increase people’s tendency to give it a moral pass, regardless of whether they believe it.

“Misinformation can stoke political polarization and undermine democracy, so it is important for people to understand when and why it spreads,” said Effron.

-- Thus far, the truth is that the president’s broader efforts to muddy the waters surrounding the Ukraine affair have been remarkably effective. About four dozen national and state polls have now been conducted since the impeachment inquiry was announced. Public attitudes have stayed remarkably consistent, and they didn’t shift in a statistically significant way after the televised congressional hearings. Our in-house pollsters Scott Clement and Emily Guskin review the data:

“Democrats and Republicans are mirror opposites on the issue, with an average of 86 percent of Democrats supporting impeachment, compared with 9 percent of Republicans. Democrats have grown more united in their support for impeachment since before the inquiry began, when polls showed roughly two-thirds supported impeachment. Among Republicans, an average of 87 percent are opposed, while 8 percent of Democrats say the same. …

“The stability of Trump’s approval ratings affirms just how locked-in Americans are in their views toward Trump, even as some independents and Democrats changed their opinion on whether Congress should impeach and remove him from office. The lack of movement in this essential measure of Trump’s political standing also indicates that while most Americans think Trump did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, news and congressional testimony about this issue have not shifted how people feel about the president.”

-- Anecdotal evidence also bears this out. An Associated Press reporter interviewed voters around Wisconsin last week and found that many either aren’t paying attention or don’t know how to decipher the back-and-forth over the president’s conduct. To wit: “Everything they say, it’s so repetitive. To me, it’s like they’re beating their heads against the wall,” said Harry Rose, a 78-year-old retired factory worker and Trump supporter in Racine County. Nicole Morrison, a 36-year-old nurse who can’t see herself voting for Trump in 2020, had a similar review. “There’s so much information that sometimes it’s hard to decide which is the truth and which is just rumors,” she said. “So I just don’t pay attention to it.”

-- In a preface to the House Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday afternoon, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) noted that the core facts aren’t in dispute and warned about the “corrosive” dangers of tribalism. “If there was one ill the Founding Founders feared as much as that of an unfit president, it may have been that of excessive factionalism,” Schiff wrote. “Although the Framers viewed parties as necessary, they also endeavored to structure the new government in such a way as to minimize the ‘violence of faction.’ As George Washington warned in his farewell address, ‘the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.’”

The Constitution is mentioned more than 100 times in the 300-page report, which alleges that Trump “compromised national security to advance his personal political interests” and engaged in an “unprecedented campaign” to obstruct congressional efforts to uncover his abuses of power. “Today, we may be witnessing a collision between the power of a remedy meant to curb presidential misconduct and the power of faction determined to defend against the use of that remedy on a president of the same party,” Schiff concluded. “But perhaps even more corrosive to our democratic system of governance, the President and his allies are making a comprehensive attack on the very idea of fact and truth. How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences?”

-- A procession of events over the past 24 hours underscored the pervasiveness of factionalism. The Intelligence Committee approved Schiff’s report on a party-line, 13-to-9 vote. Republicans on the committee released their own 123-page prebuttal the day before that said Trump’s approach to Ukraine was founded on “genuine and reasonable” suspicions about the country.

-- Attending the NATO summit in London, meanwhile, Trump accused Democrats of being “unpatriotic” by moving ahead with impeachment while he’s traveling overseas. Trump then suggested that Schiff might be “in a jail” if he wasn’t in Congress for what he’s said about the president. “I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being,” Trump said. “I think he’s a very sick man.” Trump boasted that Democrats trying to impeach him is getting rank-and-file Republicans to rally around him. “I don’t think we’ve ever had the spirit right now that we have in the Republican Party, and the impeachment hoax is what’s done it,” he said, adding that the GOP is will stick together “like glue” because of the investigations.

Democrats punched back, such as New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. But this only underscored the partisan divisions:

Unpatriotic?



You are not a King.



You are not the Chosen One.



You are not the Supreme Leader.



You are an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to our democracy who will be held accountable for your brazen #AbuseOfPower.



Count. On. It.

A video that went viral overnight shows three foreign leaders apparently laughing about Trump’s antics behind his back during a reception at Buckingham Palace. Unaware that they were on camera, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seemed to ask Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron if they were late for their audience with Queen Elizabeth II because of Trump’s impromptu press conference. “You just watched his team’s jaws drop to the floor,” Trudeau answers.

This morning, Trump called Trudeau “two-faced” for his comments on the hot mic. Sitting beside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he added that the Canadian was just lashing out because he called him out for not spending enough money on defense.

-- Perhaps the most revealing illustration of the tribalism, though, came last night when 71 House Republicans voted against a bipartisan resolution saying that Russia should not be allowed to attend future Group of Seven summits until it respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors, gives Crimea back to Ukraine and adheres to the standards of democratic societies. The measure passed with 339 votes, including unanimous Democratic support and 116 Republicans.

Republican lawmakers loudly and overwhelmingly cheered Mitt Romney when, as the party’s nominee for president in 2012, he declared that Russia was the biggest geostrategic threat facing the United States. Now, with a very different standard-bearer in Trump, many of those same lawmakers try to look the other way as a revanchist Russia viciously asserts itself against free societies and deepens strategic ties with communist China. In this case, 71 did. (The list of Republicans who voted with Russia is here.)

Trump wants to welcome an emboldened Vladimir Putin back into the fold. At the G-7 summit in France this summer, Trump strongly advocated on Russia’s behalf over multiple days. He even announced plans to invite Putin to the G-7 summit in the United States. Rank-and-file Republicans take cues from right-wing elites, including Trump and Tucker Carlson, who has used his prime-time platform on Fox News to make some startling, eyebrow-raising comments about Russia in recent days. “I think we should probably take the side of Russia, if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine,” Carlson said last week.

-- A Post contributing columnist who formerly served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia and has held a senior post on the National Security Council under Barack Obama, chastised Carlson:

I speak Russian. I know Russia. I've lived there for 8 years of my life. You are wrong Mr. Carlson. Putin does hate America. You (I assume unwittingly) help his anti-American objectives with these ill-informed rants. Be a patriot. Stop attacking Americans & defending Putin. https://t.co/izg1TwNJwH — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) December 3, 2019

-- “The inchoate and unproved nature of the Republican case against Ukraine has not prevented several GOP leaders from taking up the cause,” Bob Costa and Karoun Demirjian report. “There is also a growing view inside the GOP that the party’s core voters will not revolt if the party takes a softer position on Russia — a calculation backed by polling during Trump’s presidency. Gallup’s surveys, for instance, show that an expanding group of Republicans — 40 percent in July 2018 — now says Russia is a U.S. ally or is friendly, up from 22 percent in 2014, while 25 percent of Democrats say the same, little changed from 2014.”

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” said Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

-- As other Republicans have capitulated to Trump on Russia, Romney is holding firm. “I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” the senator from Utah told reporters on Tuesday. “Leaders of the countries are pulling for one candidate or another, that’s to be expected, but there’s a big difference between pulling for someone, hoping someone wins in the American election and interfering in the way Russia did.”

-- Many Democratic lawmakers are forcefully rejecting the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered, but this also has the unintended consequence of drawing more attention to the underlying false claim. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he’s sat through more than 25 hearings and briefings about what happened in 2016. “In none of those meetings was there ever a hint, a breath, a suggestion, a word that somehow Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election in the interference or the influence campaign. It was Russia. And it was Russia in a systematic, widespread way,” King said on CNN.

Ukrainians, including government officials, spoke out against Trump publicly in 2016 after he said that maybe Crimea should remain part of Russia. “That would be like us being angry that somebody else took Florida,” King noted. “I mean, it was understandable, but that's been blown up into somehow that Ukraine was involved in the 2016 interference campaign. It wasn't.”

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), asked David Hale, the third-ranking official at the State Department, a hearing yesterday if there was any reason to doubt Fiona Hill’s testimony last month that the conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s interference in 2016 “is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian Security Services themselves.” Hale said he did. “Is our national security made stronger or weaker when members of the administration or members of Congress insist on repeating debunked Russian lies?” Menendez asked. “That does not serve our interest,” Hale replied.

-- This whole donnybrook is just the latest illustration of the president refusing to believe his own intelligence briefings. Speaking publicly for the first time since being pushed out of government after 30 years of service, former deputy director of national intelligence Sue Gordon told the Women’s Foreign Policy Group on Tuesday that one of Trump's most common responses to intelligence briefings is to doubt what he's being told. She said “I don’t think that’s true” was the president’s most frequent reply. Trump broke with protocol by blocking Gordon from becoming acting director of national intelligence when Dan Coats stepped down this summer.

“Gordon seemed to suggest that it was more difficult trying to figure out where the President had gotten the information that was shaping his beliefs and opinions than dealing with his tendency to doubt what he was being told,” CNN reports. “Gordon's ouster came about because Trump, who has had a contentious relationship with his own intelligence services, wanted a political loyalist in the role who would ‘rein in’ the intelligence agencies. … Gordon suggested that the President's intelligence briefers not only faced a challenge because of Trump's lack of familiarity with the world of intelligence, but also because he consumes information and hears opinions that aren't as carefully vetted as an intelligence product.”

-- Believe it or not, the rank partisanship will grow even starker as the impeachment process shifts today from the Intelligence Committee to the House Judiciary Committee. Trump’s defenders are intent on making the process look as partisan and circus-like as possible, and they now have a good venue to do so. Some of Capitol Hill’s most aggressive and colorful characters are members, from Matt Gaetz and Louie Gohmert on the Republican side to Steve Cohen and Sheila Jackson Lee on the Democratic side.

Nancy Pelosi gets to handpick the members of the Intelligence Committee. Schiff keeps his members on a much tighter leash. In contrast, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is much more free-wheeling. That’s partly how that Corey Lewandowski hearing got so out of hand in September. Nadler says he’s ready for the spotlight this time. (Elise Viebeck, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore the power dynamics within the committee more deeply.) “It’s a bunch of brawlers sometimes on the Judiciary Committee, so it should get pretty hot under the collar as we go along,” said Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the panel, during an interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Phone-call records disclosed in the Intelligence Committee’s new report show extensive contact between Rudy Giuliani and the White House during key moments of the Ukraine saga. Paul Sonne, Rosalind S. Helderman and Greg Miller report: “The call records provide powerful circumstantial evidence that Giuliani was coordinating with the White House on his Ukraine gambit, something Giuliani has previously acknowledged. The records also show contact between a Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, and one of Trump’s key defenders in Congress, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.). … [Schiff] said ‘the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.’ …

“Giuliani’s phone records include calls with a number designated only as ‘-1,’ sometimes close in time to calls between Giuliani and the White House switchboard. The suggestion is that ‘-1’ might be a phone belonging to Trump, though the report does not state that clearly. Schiff, speaking to the Los Angeles Times, said he suspects the number could be Trump’s and that the committee is trying to find out whether calls logged as ‘-1’ indeed came from the president. …

“The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and [Volodymyr Zelensky] that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and ‘-1’ on Aug. 8. … The call records also show a number of phone calls between Nunes and Giuliani and between Nunes and Parnas earlier this year. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, has accused Nunes and his staff of participating in Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.”

-- The report details 58 calls Giuliani made over the course of six days. (Philip Bump breaks them down here.)

-- Nunes, speaking last night to Sean Hannity on Fox News, said it’s “possible” that he spoke with Parnas, although he doesn’t recall doing so. “I remember that name now, because he’s been indicted,” said the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. “But it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people. … We have Americans and foreigners contact us every single day with information.” He also dismissed questions about his contacts with Giuliani. “We were actually laughing about how [Bob] Mueller bombed out,” Nunes said of his conversations with Giuliani. (Felicia Sonmez)

THE LEGAL BATTLES:

-- Trump’s personal attorneys remain on the sidelines as the president battles the inquiry. Carol D. Leonnig reports: “The president is relying almost exclusively on White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and his in-house team of attorneys … The White House lawyers are not sharing with his personal attorneys some internal government records central to the inquiry about the pressure the administration put on Ukraine, citing the need to protect executive privilege. The unusual decision to have the White House counsel captain the president’s defense — at least for now — departs from how previous presidents have contended with impeachment proceedings and has worried some Trump allies, who believe a multipronged defense would be stronger. … Cipollone has taken the lead, operating separately from Jay Sekulow, a conservative Christian legal advocate who is the leader of the president’s personal legal team, joined by seasoned white-collar defense lawyers Jane and Marty Raskin.”

-- A federal judge is weighing whether to order the State Department to release internal communications between Pompeo and two of the three men designated by Trump to steer Ukraine policy. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Christopher R. ‘Casey’ Cooper of Washington on Tuesday heard arguments in a public-records lawsuit seeking communications by Kurt Volker, former State Department envoy to Ukraine, and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, with other State Department officials including Pompeo. … The Trump administration has declined to release records to the House, as part of the White House’s blanket refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. However, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) empowers judges to order the release of documents requested by members of the public, and federal lawsuits to enforce such requests can move much more quickly through the courts than battles over congressional subpoenas.”

-- A federal appeals court ruled that House Democrats can access Trump’s private financial records from two banks, citing a “public interest” by refusing to block congressional subpoenas. Ann E. Marimow and Renae Merle report: “The New York-based appeals court upheld Congress’s broad investigative authority and ordered Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House subpoenas for the president’s financial information. The court gave the president seven days to seek review by the Supreme Court in the case … Sekulow said in a statement Tuesday that Trump’s legal team believes the subpoenas are ‘invalid as issued’ and is reviewing the ruling to determine next steps, ‘including seeking review at the Supreme Court.’”

-- A key witness in Mueller’s investigation has been indicted with seven others on charges of conspiring to funnel more than $3 million in illegal campaign contributions. Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report: “George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates who acted as an intermediary for members of [Trump’s] presidential campaign seeking to forge contacts in the Middle East, was charged with conspiring to make conduit campaign contributions and related offenses in a 53-count indictment unsealed Tuesday in Washington, prosecutors said. U.S. prosecutors also charged Ahmad ‘Andy’ Khawaja, a Lebanese American businessman, with 35 counts related to allegations that he conspired with Nader to conceal the source of more than $3.5 million in campaign contributions directed to U.S. political committees associated with presidential candidates.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 Democratic race. Chelsea Janes reports: The California senator, “proud of being one of the only presidential candidates to spend Thanksgiving in Iowa and not at home, invited reporters into her temporary residence in Des Moines on the holiday to show off her turkey preparation skills. What she didn’t say at the time was that she was also having intensive conversations with her husband, her sister Maya Harris and Maya’s family as the tightknit group grappled with whether there was any path forward for her campaign. The talks extended into late Monday night, as Kamala Harris stayed up until 2 a.m. futilely trying to find a way to push on. But Tuesday around 12:45, she called her staffers to tell them it was all over. … [The end] marked a long, painful fall from her January kickoff, when Harris ran onstage to electrify a crowd of more than 22,000, the embodiment of Democratic hopes that she represented one of their best chances to beat Trump — a rising female star with a mixed-race background who could rebuild the coalition that propelled Barack Obama. …

“In a note to supporters Tuesday, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her departure. ‘I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,’ she wrote. ... Some Democratic activists saw Harris’s departure as a troubling sign that minority candidates are not faring well despite the party’s ostensible sensitivity to diversity. … The news came as a particular shock to backers who that very morning had announced a super PAC to support Harris’s candidacy. Some donors spent the day frantically trying to retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars they had wired into the super PAC’s account. …

""Harris remains a potentially appealing running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee. Unlike the senators staying in the race, she will be free to spend January focused on Trump’s expected Senate impeachment trial … An aide said an assessment of the campaign’s finances conducted over the weekend found that after raising about $12 million in each of the year’s first three quarters, the operation was failing to keep up that pace, raising just ‘a fraction’ of that amount this quarter. That left Harris without money to spend on ads in Iowa and elsewhere, essentially forcing her hand.”

-- Harris’s exit indicates that a once historically diverse Democratic field may winnow down to only whites. Philip Bump reports: “The six candidates who’ve earned a slot [in the next Democratic debate] are white. … Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. [The DNC's] strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.”

-- Castro said Harris’s campaign suffered because the media holds candidates of color to different standards. From BuzzFeed News: “‘I don’t know if it impacted her decision to withdraw from the race or not, but I’m sure it didn’t help,’ Castro, the only Latino candidate running for president, [said] on Tuesday night. ‘This was a narrative from very early on. … From the earliest critique that she has no black support, the [Congressional Black Caucus] is going other directions. It’s just holding people to different standards,’ he said.”

-- As he fights to establish himself as the most liberal candidate, Bernie Sanders has split from Elizabeth Warren with his embrace of far-left foreign leaders. From Politico: “Sanders’ foreign policy views are a clear mark of distinction from Warren in a race in which their domestic agendas are viewed as very similar. Left-wing leaders around the world see an ally in Sanders — Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently thanked him for his ‘solidarity’ and Bolivia's ousted Evo Morales called him ‘hermano Bernie Sanders’ — but have not publicly embraced Warren in the same way. … Sanders has made clear during his campaign that he shares many of the left wing's long-held critiques of American imperialism — from opposition to clandestine interference across the world, but particularly in Latin America and the Middle East, to disapproval of the American military's global footprint. … Warren, by contrast, has been more cautious on foreign affairs, straddling the line between the left and the Democratic foreign policy establishment. She has not been as definitive about the situation in Bolivia, where Morales was forced to resign under pressure by the military after allegations of election fraud in what Sanders deemed a ‘coup.’ Nor has she gone out of her way to praise and cultivate relationships with leftist figures around the world.”

-- North Carolina has a new congressional map for 2020. Ted Mellnik and Tim Meko report: “According to the Associated Press, state judges said the new map, drawn last month by Republican legislators, was good enough for immediate use and that there was not time for further study. The map is likely to add two seats for Democrats in 2020, but it probably won’t end controversy over partisan gerrymandering in the state. … Based on 2016 election results, the new map appears to tilt five districts to Democrats and eight to Republicans. The two new congressional seats expected to favor Democrats are in the 6th and 2nd districts. The 6th will pool Democrats previously divided among three Republican districts around Greensboro. The new 2nd has been carved out of a Democratic stronghold in Raleigh. There is little change in the 12th District, where Charlotte Democrats and minorities remain packed. The Democratic seats under the new map are not locks for the party. The 1st, 2nd and 4th districts all lean Democratic by less than five points, meaning they could have competitive races in 2020.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump unsettled the world stage on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London. Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: “Trump openly jousted with French President Emmanuel Macron — a leader who until recently had been one of Trump’s earliest and most prominent partners in bromance. He thrust Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau uncomfortably into the spotlight, dubbing Trudeau’s country ‘slightly delinquent’ and asking for Canada’s ‘number’ on meeting its financial commitment to NATO’s shared defense. And he previewed a likely confrontation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, also over Germany’s financial contributions to NATO. … To watch Trump perform alongside other world leaders was to witness his use of disequilibrium as political strategy, deployed throughout his presidency to keep everyone slightly off-kilter. Over the course of three one-on-one meetings with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Macron and Trudeau, Trump turned what were expected to be brief photo opportunities into his own personal daytime cable show. As the other leaders largely bore witness, the U.S. president — frequently affable, occasionally bored — held forth for a collective two hours, fielding questions on topics ranging from the impeachment investigation he left at home to the British election campaign he flew into here. …

“At his afternoon appearance with Macron, Trump and the French president articulated their disagreements — at times quite forcefully — but with a veneer of conciliation. … Macron reiterated that he was not backing down from his comments to the Economist. … ‘When we speak about NATO, it’s not just about money. We have to be respectful with our soldiers. The first burden we share, the first cost we pay, is our soldiers’ lives,’ [Macron said]. Trump then turned to Macron and suggested that Europe — and the French president in particular — should shoulder more responsibility for taking back captured Islamic State fighters. ‘Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?’ Trump asked with a smirk. ‘I can give them to you.’ … By nightfall in London, Trump and Macron appeared to have put the day’s acrimony aside. … Several leaders will enter the formal NATO meeting on Wednesday with strategies inside their thick briefing books about what to do if Trump threatens to quit NATO on the spot.”

-- Today is the second day of the NATO summit, and participants are bracing for more contentious meetings. Michael Birnbaum raises the curtain: “Trump was scheduled for a day of highs and lows: after the three-hour discussion with all 28 other NATO leaders, he planned to have lunch with representatives from countries that are meeting spending alliance spending guidelines. It could be a moment to showcase his efforts to boost European defense contributions. But he will also have a one-on-one meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel … At the meeting, leaders are expected to approve a slew of new defense plans in a choreographed move intended to paper over the contentious relations of recent years. They will agree that outer space is a military domain that NATO needs to defend. They will also discuss how the alliance should handle the rise of China as a potential strategic threat. And they will agree on plans for Europe and Canada to spend more money on NATO’s central budget, to save the United States some money — a drop in the bucket in the context of overall defense spending, but still a symbolic gesture to Trump’s demands that other countries pick up some of the slack. Leaders are also expected to clash about a Turkish demand that the alliance give concessions about the Kurdish fighting groups in northeast Syria that have been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Erdogan says the Kurds are dangerous terrorists — and he has blocked unrelated approvals for updated military plans to defend the Baltics from Russia until he gets his way.”

-- The French government threatened massive European Union retaliation if Trump follows through on his threats to slap tariffs on dozens of popular French products. James McAuley reports: “Later in the day, [Trump] suggested that some kind of compromise might be achievable, and [Macron] indicated his willingness to work toward one. This came hours after Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, vowed what he called a ‘strong European riposte’ to Trump’s proposed tariffs.”

-- Trump announced that next year's G-7 summit will be held at Camp David after giving up plans to hold it at his private resort in Doral, Fla. Colby Itkowitz reports: ‘We’re going to do it at Camp David and we’ll be doing some special things at Camp David,’ Trump said. ‘It’s nearby, it’s close. We’re going to give really great access to the press, you’ll have great access. And we’ll have a little bit of a Washington deliverance. But it will be at Camp David, which is a place people like.’ The White House had previously panned suggestions that he host at Camp David in Maryland, as [Obama] had in 2012. ‘I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7,’ acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had said in an Oct. 17 news conference. ‘It was way too small. It was way too remote.’”

-- Trump is waging a war of attrition against America’s diplomats. From GQ: “Previously unpublished data from the AFSA shows that the foreign service is losing people at an alarming clip. In the first two years of Trump’s presidency, nearly half of the State Department’s Career Ministers retired or were pushed out. Another 20 percent of its Minister Counselors, one rank level down, also left.”

-- Trump nearly avoided wading into British politics while at NATO. William Booth and Karla Adam report: The president “was relatively diplomatic Tuesday, promising to ‘stay out’ of British politics, just 10 days before a general election. But he couldn’t quite help himself. In the same breath, Trump declared that his ally Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ‘very capable and I think he’ll do a good job” if elected Dec. 12. As for Johnson’s opponent, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, the president on Tuesday said, ‘I can work with anybody.’”

-- Murky allegations of supposed Russian interference in the British election are flying, with less than two weeks to go before voters head to the polls. Adam Taylor reports: “The latest victim is Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party and a challenger to the Conservative government of Boris Johnson, who had last month proudly displayed a series of leaked government documents that portrayed ongoing bilateral trade negotiations in an unflattering role. On Tuesday, the country’s leading center-right newspaper splashed its front page with a headline that argued the dossier ‘points to Russians.’ Citing an investigation by the consulting firm Graphika, the Daily Telegraph wrote that senior members of the Conservative Party were now calling for Corbyn to ‘come clean.’ But wait — hasn’t the Conservative government been asked to come clean, too? Yes, Johnson’s right-wing government has its own, unresolved issues with Russia. At the start of November, it was accused of sitting on a report that investigates possible Russian interference in British politics, delaying the release of the report’s supposedly damning findings until after the Dec. 12 vote.”

-- Global greenhouse gas emissions will hit another record high this year, experts project. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Total carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry totaled 36.8 billion tons, according to an estimate from the Global Carbon Project, an academic consortium that produces the figures annually. That represents a 0.6 percent increase from 2018, which until now stood as the record. … Global emissions have risen for three consecutive years, at a time when they should be starting to drop sharply if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The news of still-growing greenhouse gas emissions is the latest in a drumbeat of negative findings that come as world leaders gather in Madrid for an annual climate change conference, where they face mounting pressure to alter the current trajectory.”

​​​​​​-- North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is -- quite literally -- back on his white horse, inspecting “revolutionary battle sites” on a sacred mountain as Pyongyang foreshadowed a major policy decision later this month. Simon Denyer and Min Joo Kim report: “The images of Kim on horseback, returning to Mount Paektu after a similar visit in October, were high on symbolism. But it was a second, more dryly worded announcement on Wednesday that was at least as significant. The Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea decided to convene the fifth plenary meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea in the latter part of December, the Korean Central News Agency said, ‘to discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad.’ Put simply, after giving the United States until the end of the year to change its approach to denuclearization talks and warning that North Korea would follow a ‘new path,’ Kim appears to have made his decision on what that path should be, experts said.”

-- China criticized the U.S. House for passing a bill backing sanctions on Beijing over the mass detention of Muslims. Gerry Shih reports: “The Uighur Act cleared the House by 407 to 1 a week after [Trump] signed legislation that would sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials involved in human rights abuses in the protest-ridden financial hub. China has angrily denounced both measures and said Wednesday it would respond to the House’s passage of the Uighur Act, which must be reconciled with a Senate version passed in September before it reaches Trump’s desk. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged the United States to ‘immediately correct its mistake, stop the above bill on Xinjiang from becoming law, and stop using Xinjiang as a way to interfere in China’s domestic affairs.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- McKinsey, the consulting giant, has been helping to support the implementation of the Trump administration's immigration agenda. But some of their draconian suggestions for cost-cutting have been deemed as overly harsh, and even inhumane, by career ICE employees. From ProPublica and the New York Times: “ICE quickly redirected McKinsey toward helping the agency figure out how to execute the White House’s clampdown on illegal immigration. But the money-saving recommendations the consultants came up with made some career ICE workers uncomfortable. They proposed cuts in spending on food for migrants, as well as on medical care and supervision of detainees, according to interviews with people who worked on the project for both ICE and McKinsey and 1,500 pages of documents obtained from the agency after ProPublica filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. McKinsey’s team also looked for ways to accelerate the deportation process, provoking worries among some ICE staff members that the recommendations risked short-circuiting due-process protections for migrants fighting removal from the United States. The consultants, three people who worked on the project said, seemed focused solely on cutting costs and speeding up deportations — actions whose success could be measured in numbers — with little acknowledgment that these policies affected thousands of human beings.”

-- The Trump administration plans on cutting off food stamps benefits for about 750,000 Americans. From Bloomberg News: A new regulation will make it “harder for states to gain waivers from a requirement that beneficiaries work or participate in a vocational training program … The work requirement only applies to ‘able-bodied’ recipients who aren’t caring for a child under 6 years old. The measure would be the first of three Trump administration initiatives curtailing food stamp benefits to take effect. The Urban Institute estimated in an analysis last month that the measures together would cut 3.7 million beneficiaries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, often known by its previous name, food stamps.”

­-- The White House is torpedoing the bipartisan tradition of confirming nominees from both parties for positions at independent agencies. From the National Journal: “For decades, presidents have tapped Republican and Democratic nominees in tandem to fill open slots on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and many other independent bodies. But this week, senators are preparing to confirm Republican Robert Duncan to another term as chairman at one of those agencies, the United States Postal Service Board of Governors, without a Democratic companion.”

-- Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone resigned following accusations that he mishandled sex abuse cases. Chico Harlan reports: “Under Malone’s watch, Buffalo had become perhaps the U.S. Church’s most scandal-tainted diocese. It faces an FBI probe and more than 200 lawsuits. Malone pledged to institute reforms, but he was instead battered by accusations of coverup and by embarrassing leaks. One whistleblower said she found a 300-page dossier on accused priests hidden away in a supply closet near a vacuum cleaner. In a short statement, the Vatican said that Malone would be replaced on a temporary basis by Albany’s bishop, Edward Scharfenberger. Malone, 73, is departing two years before the mandatory age at which bishops must offer their retirements to Pope Francis — though many prelates stay on the job beyond the 75-year mark.”

-- Senate Republicans are poised to confirm either today or tomorrow a Trump judicial nominee who claimed that fertility treatments and surrogacy have “grave effects on society, including diminished respect for motherhood and the unique mother-child bond; exploitation of women; commodification of gestation and of children themselves; and weakening of appropriate social mores against eugenic abortion.” HuffPost reports: “Sarah Pitlyk, [Trump’s] nominee to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, argued those points in a 2017 amicus brief opposing a California statute that protects the right to assisted reproductive technology like in vitro fertilization, or IVF, and gestational surrogacy. Pitlyk … went on to say in a 2017 interview with the National Catholic Register that ‘surrogacy is harmful to mothers and children, so it’s a practice society should not be enforcing.’ Nearly 1 in 6 U.S. couples face infertility, according to a 2014 National Institutes of Health study.

“Pitlyk, 42, fits the mold of many of Trump’s judicial nominees: She’s young, white and a member of the Federalist Society. … She defended anti-abortion activist David Daleiden, who broke federal and state laws by secretly recording and deceptively editing videos that falsely claimed to expose Planned Parenthood’s illegal sale of fetal tissue. She defended Iowa’s six-week abortion ban that was later struck down as unconstitutional. In another case, Pitlyk argued that it is ‘scientific fact’ that ‘human life begins at the moment when a human sperm fertilizes a human egg.’ (It is not scientific fact.)

“So far, Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the only Republican who plans to oppose Pitlyk’s confirmation, meaning Pitlyk has the votes to be confirmed. In a statement, Collins cited Pitlyk’s ‘troubling assertions’ about fertility treatments. … Collins also raised concerns with Pitlyk earning a rare and embarrassing “not qualified” rating by the American Bar Association based on her lack of experience. The rating was unanimously decided. … Pitlyk previously clerked for Brett Kavanaugh. … When Kavanaugh was credibly accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Pitlyk came to his defense. … Pitlyk also publicly dismissed Ford’s story, saying in a CNN interview that it was ‘hard to take it seriously…’”

-- Describing it as an “untamed beast” in “distress,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos wants to spin off the Federal Student Aid office into a new agency. Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports: “The proposal follows a series of missteps involving the office that intensified scrutiny of DeVos’s leadership, including the release of $11 million in loans to unaccredited for-profit colleges and the violation of a court order to halt collections on former Corinthian Colleges students. … Policy experts have questioned whether the office has the economic expertise to meet the challenge and have recommended changes, but they have stopped short of calling for anything on the scale of what DeVos is proposing. … The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators has long urged Congress to review whether the Federal Student Aid office is subject to enough supervision by the education secretary. DeVos referred to the trade group’s past critiques of the office in her speech Tuesday, but the group’s president, Justin Draeger, noted that spinning off the unit was never among its recommendations.”

-- The Supreme Court seems skeptical that Superfund landowners can seek a more extensive cleanup than what the Environmental Protection Agency has approved. Robert Barnes reports: ""The court was considering a massive cleanup of arsenic from a 300-square-mile section of Montana where a copper smelter operated for nearly 100 years. The Anaconda valley has been a Superfund cleanup site since 1983, and owner Atlantic Richfield already has spent more than $470 million to remove toxic chemicals from the land. But nearly 100 homeowners in the area want more work done, and they went to state court in hopes of convincing a jury that the company should pay an additional $50 million to reduce the arsenic level in the ground. The Montana Supreme Court said the suit could proceed.

-- New York City is shipping its homeless to squalid housing out of the state, officials in Newark allege in a new lawsuit. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The complaint, which names the city of New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks as defendants, accuses the city’s Special One-Time Assistance program, or SOTA, of violating commerce laws by pushing recipients into Newark apartments that are not suitable for living and sometimes illegal. The suit comes amid a national battle to mitigate a national homeless crisis that has left many of the country’s urban areas desperate for answers.”

-- Rep. Steve Watkins (R-Kan.) is facing perjury and voter fraud allegations for listing a UPS store as his home residence. From the Topeka Capital-Journal: “Shawnee County records show the first-term Republican listed his official residence as 6021 S.W. 29th St. in Topeka, which corresponds to a UPS Store, when he signed a form to change his residency for voter registration purposes in August, signed an application for a mail-in ballot in October and signed a document to complete advance voting for the November election. It isn’t clear where the congressman physically resided in Kansas after August nor what Topeka precinct he was legally qualified to be part of when voting in November. By asserting his place of residence to be the UPS Store, Watkins left the Topeka City Council’s 5th District for the city council’s 8th District. He then cast a November ballot in an 8th District contest decided by 13 votes.”

-- The D.C. Council voted unanimously to recommend Jack Evans for expulsion over multiple ethics violations. Fenit Nirappil reports: “The action comes after a series of investigations that found Evans, the city’s longest-serving lawmaker, used his public office to benefit private clients and employers who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars. … A person who spoke to Evans on Tuesday afternoon said the lawmaker recognized his council tenure was over and was concerned about being the first member to be expelled but was not yet prepared to resign. … Evans has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. In a letter sent last week, Evans’s lawyers argued that expulsion would override the will of voters.”

He also plans to raise $800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors, as well as $400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes, among other measures.

Biden “is committed to being transparent with the American people about the smart and effective ways he’d pay for the bold changes he’s proposing,” said Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director.

AD

AD

The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.

The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s.

Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.

AD

Biden also opts not to adopt more-aggressive measures that had been under consideration by some advisers to his campaign, including a new tax on Wall Street transactions.

AD

Similarly, Biden proposes increasing the top income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent, where it was before the 2017 GOP tax law. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.

“[Biden] continues to carve out for himself an agenda that’s in the single-digit trillions rather than the double-digit trillions,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served as an adviser to Biden when he was vice president, who added the plan was still highly progressive. “That’s designed to appeal to the moderate part of the electorate, and so far that’s worked.”

AD

Biden’s plan is also likely to meet resistance from conservatives for dramatically raising taxes on firms through a number of measures — many of which were also pushed by President Barack Obama.

AD

Even though Biden’s proposal is starkly different than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary, it would further set him apart from the approach President Trump has promised to pursue. Trump has called for following up the $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017 with a new round of tax cuts, which advisers want to market as a boost for the middle class.

Biden’s plan would seek to prevent corporations from taking advantage of the tax code in a way that allows them to avoid paying many taxes. It would set a global minimum tax for companies based in the United States to recapture revenue if they book their profits in low-tax jurisdictions such as Bermuda or Ireland.

AD

It would also cap how much firms can claim in deductions, end loopholes for real estate investors in the tax code and impose sanctions on countries that allow illegal corporate tax avoidance. Biden had backed many of these ideas before this week but not in as much detail as the newly released plan.

AD

While more acceptable to Republicans than the ideas of Sanders and Warren, Biden’s plan would still make the United States the most heavily taxed country for firms in the OECD, when state and local taxes are taken into account, said Brian Riedl, a tax expert at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

Biden’s math is made easier by pitching less dramatic federal programs than his opponents. Sanders and Warren have called for more than $20 trillion of new spending on a Medicare-for-all health-care system that would guarantee free coverage to all Americans.

AD

Biden’s health-care plan, which the campaign says will cost less than $1 trillion, would leave 10 million people without insurance and do far less to rein in high deductibles and premiums faced by millions of Americans.

Sanders has pushed a plan to tackle climate change that would cost $16 trillion, calling for $2 trillion alone as part of a “Green New Deal” on funding to weatherize and retrofit homes and businesses. Biden’s climate change and infrastructure proposal would cost about $1.7 trillion in total.

AD

Biden’s tax plan also says it will raise $750 billion for his higher-education plan, which includes debt-free community college. Warren and Sanders have proposed trillions in new education spending, as well as the elimination or vast reduction of student debt.

“Biden continues to plan the least ambitious federal program of the top-tier candidates,” said Robert C. Hockett, a professor at Cornell University who has provided policy input for Warren and Sanders. “It’s kind of a drop in the bucket given the long-term problems in the economy. It’s small potatoes for a federal plan.”

The pointed ad marks the continued fallout after Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other dignitaries were caught on camera Tuesday engaging in a brief exchange apparently about Trump that quickly spiraled into an international incident. On Wednesday, Trudeau, Macron and Johnson were forced to field questions about the candid conversation and Trump was described as “the scorned child on the global playground” and “a sulking, brooding president,” The Washington Post reported.

Set to dramatic instrumental music, Biden’s ad opens with Trump grinning and flashing a thumbs up as he stands flanked by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.

But the video quickly cuts to the Tuesday footage of the leaders at Buckingham Palace and their animated conversation.

“Several world leaders mocking President Trump,” another speaker says. The video zooms in on Macron talking before jumping to a close-up of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte mid-laugh. Other clips show Johnson and Trudeau smiling.

The ad then calls attention to other occasions where Trump has been met with derision from foreign leaders, including video of the president addressing the U.N. General Assembly last year, where his remarks were met with “audible guffaws” from audience members, The Post’s David Nakamura reported.

“And if we give Donald Trump four more years, we’ll have a great deal of difficulty of ever being able to recover America’s standing in the world, and our capacity to bring nations together,” Biden says over images of himself with foreign leaders such as Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

In a Wednesday tweet, Trump defended his behavior at the summit, writing, “I got along great with the NATO leaders.”

“As the President has said, Joe Biden claims that foreign leaders have told him they want him to win the election. Of course they do,” Murtaugh wrote in an email to The Post. “They want to keep ripping off the United States like they did before Trump became President.”

The viral video from Buckingham Palace offered Biden a chance to highlight a regular theme from his campaign: emphasizing his foreign policy experience, while slamming Trump’s handling of global relations. In November, Biden’s campaign touted endorsements from 133 foreign policy experts and former officials who supported the former vice president as the “best antidote” to Trump, The Post’s Josh Rogin wrote. Days later, Biden accused Trump of “shredding our alliances” during an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon.

AD

At an event in Ames, Iowa, earlier on Wednesday, Biden had declined to directly attack Trump’s NATO performance, citing his stance that presidents shouldn’t be criticized while they are on foreign soil, WHO-DT reported. “What happened in the recent NATO conference has disturbed me. Really, really disturbed me,” he said.

AD

But less than an hour after Air Force One delivered Trump back to the U.S. on Wednesday night, Biden dropped his ad.

On social media, the video was met with mixed reactions. Some praised Biden’s team for creating what one person called “the best anti-Trump ad I’ve seen yet.” Others warned that the ad would only inspire a similar video from the Trump campaign centered on Biden’s numerous gaffes.

Viewers, however, did appear to largely agree on one thing: Trump would not be pleased.

“@realDonaldTrump is going to explode,” one person tweeted.

The ad marks the latest development in the story of several world leaders — including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, French president Emmanuel Macron, and British prime minister Boris Johnson — mocking Trump at a NATO summit this week. Trump called Trudeau two-faced when asked about the hot-mic moment. But he also said Trudeau is “a nice guy.”

The ad also includes video from a speech Trump gave to the United Nations in 2018. “In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,” Trump said, eliciting laughter from the crowd.

When Trump was running for president, he often spoke about the world laughing at the U.S. In fact, he’s been saying it for decades, according to the Washington Post, which found “103 times, going as far back as 1987” of Trump saying the U.S. is a global laughingstock. He was supposed to end that."

Joe Biden called an 83-year-old Iowa man a “damn liar” and challenged him to a push-up contest at a campaign stop Thursday. The tense exchange began with the man, who identified himself as a retired farmer, telling Biden he has two problems with him.

“You’re too old,” the man said, pointing out that he himself is 83 and doesn’t have the “mental faculties” he once did. (Biden is 77.) Then he moved on to Ukraine. “We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine, over there, pulling their foreign aid for them to say they’re going to investigate you,” he said.

“But you on the other hand, sent your son over there,” he continued. “You’re selling access to the president, just like he does.”

“You’re a damn liar, man,” said Biden, who had reason to object. The former VP has a record of pushing anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine and there’s no evidence he “sent” his son to Ukraine to sell access to President Obama. The two went back and forth for another 90 seconds, with Biden countering the man’s concerns over his age by challenging him to a push-up contest and an IQ test.

It’s interesting to recall that just over two months ago there was speculation that Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign might be finished. After the natural initial fears faded, nobody really thought his heart attack would keep him from staying in the race. But the general feeling outside his own camp was that it was a potential coup de grace for an already-struggling campaign that had lost a lot of its mojo to the high-flying Elizabeth Warren.

Instead, Sanders has hung in there and improved his relative position even as Warren has lost altitude. And as pundits have come back around to examining his base of support, many have come to realize something about it that is somewhat different and quite important, as Ron Brownstein reports:

[T]here are signs Hispanics may prove a kind of secret weapon for Sanders. In a recent Fox News poll of Nevada, Hispanics there preferred Sanders over Biden by 7 percentage points. Sanders also led Biden with them by 9 points in a recent Latino Decisions poll of California and doubled the former vice president’s vote among them in the University of Texas at Tyler poll. Sanders narrowly led Biden with Hispanics in a New York Times/Siena poll of Florida, and the two ran even in Arizona, according to the OH Predictive Insights survey.

The evidence of Sanders’s strength among Latinos is everywhere, most recently in a University of California IGS survey of the Golden State, where Sanders led the field, in no small part because of his 32 percent showing (Biden is second at 19 percent) among Latinos.

Brownstein notes that Sanders did well among younger Latinos in 2016, but quotes his pollster to the effect that Bernie is now exhibiting “more appeal across generations” in this demographic group. Perhaps — though cross tabs from Morning Consult’s most recent tracking poll show Sanders leading Biden 40/16 (with Warren at 11) among under-35 Latinos and 24/18 (with Warren at 16) among Latinos aged 34–44. But among Latinos aged 45–65, Biden leads Sanders 35/16 (Warren is at 12) and among Latino seniors Biden’s lead balloons to 45/10 (with Warren at 9). Sanders has an overall 29/23 lead over Biden (with Warren at 12) in this demographic because Latinos are an unusually young ethnic group.

The age factor is also critical to Sanders’s solid if less-powerful positioning among African-American voters, too. According to Morning Consult, Bernie is leading Joe Biden among under-30 black voters by a 41/23 margin. But at the other end of the age spectrum, among black seniors, Biden trounces Sanders 61/6.

As I noted recently, Sanders and Biden have joined Andrew Yang and Julian Castro as the remaining candidates who are drawing more support from nonwhite than white voters (by contrast, according to CNN data, Warren’s white/nonwhite percentages are at 17/9, and Pete Buttigieg’s are at 17/4). As the nomination contest calendar moves to more diverse states after New Hampshire, this dimension of their electoral bases could help them rebound from losses to Warren and/or Buttigieg in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire."

Kamala Harris has dropped out. Cory Booker hasn’t qualified for December’s debate. Julián Castro missed November’s and is polling between zero and one percent nationally. At various points, all three were considered heirs apparent to the voting bloc that lifted Barack Obama to victory. And all three are strong arguments for why the vaunted “Obama coalition” might’ve been the ex-president’s alone.

Conventional wisdom has long held that re-creating Obama’s path to the White House hinged on building a base out of Northern whites, young people, and energized black and Latino voters. The last debate saw Harris and Booker each cast themselves as the candidate best equipped to accomplish this. “We’ve got to re-create the Obama coalition to win,” Harris said. “[Nobody] on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters,” said Booker. Neither has built a convincing case for themselves. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has consistently led polls of Democratic primary voters, including black and Latino ones, and most maneuvering from his nonwhite challengers has been aimed at undermining his dominance. A senescent white centrist might seem an unlikely inheritor of Obama’s supporters, but Biden is well on his way. “I’m part of that Obama coalition,” the 77-year-old said at the debate. “I have more people supporting me, in the black community, that have announced for me, because they know me. They know who I am.”

Almost every political figure upon whom pols and pundits have bestowed the “next Obama” moniker has traits in common: They’re invariably young, almost always nonwhite (Beto O’Rourke, who earned early plaudits from the ex-president, was a rare exception), and have an inspiring but necessarily vague message aimed at flattering their countrymen’s better angels. They embody the shifting demographics that strategists believe will define the electorate of the future: nonwhite with fluency navigating a multiracial milieu without making its occupants feel at odds. But Trump’s election has altered this calculus. White voters who dabbled in multiracial democracy during the Obama years have proven equally enticed by a white supremacist. In 2020, voters repulsed by Trump are less interested in making history and electing some nebulous candidate for America’s diverse future. They want to beat Trump. And most seem to have decided that a challenger whose case for electability is a superficial resemblance to Obama isn’t their best bet.

This isn’t to say that Harris, Booker, and Castro don’t have qualities that recommend them. Castro in particular has distinguished himself with his thoughtful platform aimed at poor people, undocumented immigrants, and the criminalized and incarcerated; Booker has the Trump era’s signature piece of bipartisan legislation under his belt with the First Step Act; and Harris has shined during adversarial exchanges with Republicans in Senate hearings. But it stands to reason that a person seeking to recapture the so-called Obama coalition should bear more than a passing resemblance to the man himself. And none come close: The ex-president’s mix of charisma, rhetorical skill, political savvy, and intelligence remain unparalleled in today’s Democratic Party, and make him a singular figure in modern politics regardless of racial background. His success was also specific to its time. Much of the American public had soured on George W. Bush’s leadership and warmongering by 2008, and Obama not only represented the most striking contrast, he was one of the few senators in the race who hadn’t voted for the Iraq War. (He was not yet in the Senate at the time, but spoke out against the war beforehand.) This gave him an air of legitimacy with progressive voters that Booker and Harris — with their evangelism for charter schools and work as a prosecutor, respectively — are missing. Both were left with a narrow path to the nomination: Either convince black voters and white moderates that they were surer bets than Biden in the general election, or prove to progressives that their bona fides belied a pragmatism and diverse appeal that made them viable alternatives to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

None of it has worked. Their presumed constituencies have found their preferred candidates elsewhere. Older black voters have gravitated to Biden, with his political longevity and vows to preserve Obama’s legislative legacy, while younger black voters have been drawn to the structural change and revolutionary fervor peddled by Warren and Sanders, respectively. Hampering Booker, Harris, and Castro’s cases further was a lack of clarity regarding why an electorate that just backed Trump would suddenly be enticed by a less-galvanizing echo of his predecessor, the black president whose legacy Trump vowed to negate. Voters in 2020 won’t have suddenly lost their susceptibility to the president’s racist charms. And few on the Democratic side are willing to submit a candidate whose appeal to white people with questionable racial politics is dubious or unproven.

Given the Democratic electorate’s consuming desire to oust Trump, it’s unclear if Obama himself could’ve made it out of the 2020 primary. The eventual president trailed Hillary Clinton among even black voters in 2008 until he proved he could win overwhelmingly white electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire. The prospect of continued Republican governance is threat enough today that risk aversion is at a premium. Many voters — and black voters in particular — agree that it’s no time to roll the dice on an unknown quantity, as Obama would’ve been considered. This is by no means a universal consensus. The success of Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns suggest an appetite for democratic socialism that would upend the status quo. Pete Buttigieg is overperforming as a small-city mayor. Andrew Yang has built a coalition that, while almost negligibly small, has generated consistently higher polling numbers than either Booker or Castro.

But generally speaking, the assumption that nonwhite candidates would be best positioned to rebuild Obama’s coalition by virtue of their shared nonwhiteness and a handful of other superficial parallels hasn’t borne out. Democrats instead have thus far coalesced behind a white septuagenarian who fought against busing, implied that every black candidate before Obama was “unclean,” and had at least one other presidential campaign end ignominiously. They’ve done so largely because Biden is well-known and well-liked, has personal ties to the white Rust Belt voters who helped deliver Trump’s win in 2016, and boasts goodwill among liberal voters generated by his affiliation with Obama, who was extremely popular. Simply put, they think he’s the guy that the widest range of voters can agree on. And if this is the conclusion they’ve drawn a mere three years after Obama exited the White House, it’s worth asking whether his coalition, activated by a candidate with a profile similar to his own, was more fluky confluence of circumstances than replicable political strategy.

With the deadline to qualify days away, four white men and two white women have qualified so far, including former vice president Joe Biden, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, billionaire Tom Steyer, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.). Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are both nonwhite candidates, each need one more good poll to qualify, whereas Booker, who is black, and former housing secretary Julián Castro haven’t hit 4 percent in any of the required polls. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black, entered the race Nov. 14 and also does not have any qualifying polls.

For many critics, the question was how this historically diverse class of candidates has faded to white — at least on the national debate stage — before February’s Iowa caucuses. To Booker, part of the problem is that this cycle’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee’s qualifying rules are “preferencing millionaires and billionaires.” To Castro, the news media’s narrative on “electability” has also played a role — an issue he cited in part for both Harris’s downfall and the difficulties facing nonwhite candidates vying for a spot on the debate stage.

Harris had qualified for the debate but cited a lack of funds as the main reason for her decision to bow out. In recent weeks, several news stories described internal turmoil and tense disagreements among staffers in her campaign.

Castro pointed to stories in the New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, all of which questioned the health of Harris’s presidential bid after losing its early momentum and running into management issues. But in a videotaped interview posted to Twitter on Tuesday night, Castro argued that the media’s treatment of Harris had been “grossly unfair and unfortunate” and that Harris was held “to a different standard, a higher standard.”

Speaking more generally, he added on Twitter later: “The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” he said. “Our party’s diversity is our strength, and it’s a shame that we’re headed for a December debate without a single person of color.”

Castro’s criticism stems from debate within the Democratic Party about which candidate is most equipped to corral support from a multiracial coalition of voters, as President Barack Obama did, while having the best chance at defeating President Trump. As The Post’s Philip Bump reported in a Tuesday analysis, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the most capable of beating Trump, according to a November Post-ABC News poll.

In a fundraising video Tuesday, Castro said he was still a few thousand donors away from meeting the DNC’s donor requirements for qualifying for the debate. The rules also require candidates to score in four approved polls over 4 percent, or two early-state polls over 6 percent, and to have 200,000 unique donors plus a minimum of 800 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins, who also previously worked on former Democratic congressman John Delaney’s presidential campaign, told Fox News that he believed the DNC’s rules “ended up hurting” the campaigns of candidates like Castro, Harris and Booker because campaigns must spend “insane amounts” of money on donor lists to meet the requirement. He worried that not having a person of color onstage would affect turnout, particularly among African American voters.

Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization that advocates for electing women of color, said she worried about whether the candidates on the debate stage would resonate with black female voters. “It’s a sad state of affairs to have six white candidates onstage, many of whom don’t necessarily speak with black women — who are the powerhouse voters,” she told MSNBC on Tuesday.

AD

Like Booker, Castro, in his fundraising video, also criticized wealthier candidates who “basically buy their way onto this debate stage.” In a fundraising email of her own, Warren attacked billionaires Steyer and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, another recent addition to the Democratic race, while lamenting Harris’s departure.

“Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand — two women senators who, together, won more than 11.5 million votes in their last elections — have been forced out of this race, while billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg have been allowed to buy their way in,” Warren wrote. “Running for president shouldn’t be a passion project for bored billionaires.""

But some Republicans mocked Democrats’ concern that the field of candidates on the debate stage may be all white. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) made a quip on Twitter that critics called racist. Linking to a tweet listing the all-white lineup for the debate, Cheney wrote: “You forgot Pocahontas.” Using a favorite Trump nickname, Cheney was referring to Warren, who apologized earlier this year for identifying as Native American during her law career. (A spokesman for Cheney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment in response to the backlash.)

Others pointed out that Harris’s campaign faltered because of other problems, such as her record as a prosecutor. On Tuesday, Harris said she was “still very much in this fight.”

When Trump said he would “miss” her in an apparently facetious tweet, Harris responded: “Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see you at your trial.”

This tells us a great deal about the state of the Democratic Party and how it has affected Biden, who is assumed to be the ideologically moderate choice for president (along with other candidates, including Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar). The plan’s main features:

AD

End the preferential treatment of investment income for those making more than $1 million a year. Right now, you pay higher taxes on wage income (money you get by working) than on investment income (money you get when your money makes you more money). Biden’s plan would tax all that income the same for the extremely wealthy.

Raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.

End the “stepped-up basis rule” that allows people who inherit stocks and property to pay little or no taxes on those assets.

Institute a 15 percent minimum corporate tax, to prevent corporations from using loopholes to reduce their tax bills to nothing.

Raise the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent, where it was before the Trump tax cuts.

Cap the amount of deductions the wealthy can take.

There are a few other proposals (here’s a good rundown), but those are the most significant ones. It’s true that it doesn’t contain the kind of wealth tax that Warren and Sanders have proposed. And as Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute pointed out to me, it does accept some features of the Obama-era tax code as the limits of what you can do, like precisely a 39.6 percent top rate (when he could have proposed 40 percent or 50 percent).

But in other ways, Bivens noted, “It’s a far more ambitious plan than anything even the Obama aspirational budgets,” the yearly President’s Budget released by the White House, proposed.

AD

Which tells us that the “moderate” position on taxes, as on other issues, has moved significantly to the left.

You can make a direct comparison with health care. When Biden was vice president, single-payer health care was considered something of a fringe idea in the Democratic Party, advocated by people like Sanders but not taken too seriously. Then it moved to the heart of the party’s debate on health care, the result of which was that a robust public option became the moderate position.

AD

Today, many on the left view a public option as a sellout, even though the one advocated by (among others) Biden is far more progressive than the Affordable Care Act, potentially giving tens of millions of Americans the protection of government health insurance and making single-payer in the future far more likely.

AD

This tax plan is very similar. In fact, it’s a combination of proposals that Obama never even considered and things that at various times he put in budget proposals but knew would never find their way into law because Republicans controlled one or both houses of Congress.

So ideas such as equalizing taxes between wage and investment income (which I’ve been shouting about for years) or eliminating the stepped-up basis loophole were suggested by Obama, but without any illusions that they would become law. Now they’re in Biden’s campaign tax plan, which will necessarily be the starting point for legislation if he becomes president. That brings them a giant step closer to reality.

AD

The entire atmosphere has changed. I also spoke to Jared Bernstein, who was Biden’s chief economic adviser when he was vice president. (Bernstein did not have any role in crafting this plan.) He argued that in part because of a reaction to increasing regressive Republican tax policies and in part because of the prominence of more ambitious proposals such as a wealth tax, ideas about what Democrats should or can do have shifted to the left.

AD

So a reasonably progressive plan like this one would be able to pass through Congress if Democrats took control, which means winning the support of the most conservative Democratic senators, like Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema.

“When I go through this list,” Bernstein said, “I see a lot of stuff that I think the marginal Democratic senator would be okay with.”

AD

The “moderate” position on taxes among Democrats has now become not only increasing them on the wealthy, but also doing in ways that could make the tax system substantially more fair and provide significant funding for social programs — ways that were considered pipe dreams just a few years ago. Even if you think Biden’s plan doesn’t go far enough, that’s reason to be pleased.

— letter from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Nov. 21, 2019

AD

President Trump has falsely claimed that then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Ukraine’s largest private gas company, Burisma, at a time when Hunter Biden was on the Burisma board. In fact, the opposite is true — Joe Biden was carrying out administration policy, coordinated with European allies, to press for the removal of Shokin because he was not investigating corruption.

These facts have not stopped Trump’s Republican defenders from trying to prove Trump correct. In recent weeks, senior lawmakers have suggested that there was a nefarious connection between a “raid” in February 2016 on the home of the founder of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, and calls that Biden made at the time with Ukraine’s president at the time, Petro Poroshenko.

AD

Graham has made this alleged connection the start of an investigation he has launched into Biden and his son, demanding records and transcripts of Biden’s calls to Ukraine that month.

AD

The Fact Checker was suspicious of these claims because it had been our understanding that the investigation of Zlochevsky was largely dormant at the time of Biden’s diplomacy. Indeed, the U.S. ambassador at the time had singled out mismanagement of the Zlochevsky case as an example of Ukraine’s failing to hold corrupt officials to account.

Working with our colleagues Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern, who discussed the case with sources while reporting in Kyiv, we’ve determined that this alleged connection is based on a misunderstanding of what took place in the Ukrainian courts.

AD

The Facts

Zlochevsky had served in top Ukrainian government positions in the country’s energy sector and had transformed himself into one of the country’s richest men. In the process, he has faced years of legal troubles and allegations of corruption, which he has denied. Britain once froze $23 million of his assets, but he was not charged with any crimes and the freeze was eventually lifted.

AD

Zlochevsky was also under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors. On Aug. 5, 2014, the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) initiated case 42014000000000805 regarding “large-scale” illicit enrichment and money laundering allegedly committed by Zlochevsky, according to a timeline provided to Birnbaum by the Anticorruption Action Center (AntAC), a leading anti-corruption group.

AD

After briefly transferring the case to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, on Dec. 29, 2014, the PGO issued a notification of suspicion to Zlochevsky regarding the allegations. AntAC reports that prospects for success were “low from the very beginning” because the statutes for “illicit enrichment” required a high burden of proof to show that assets were proceeds of bribery. (Ukrainian journalists say that making the case briefly a police matter led to the unfreezing of Zlochevsky’s assets in Britain.)

Nevertheless, on Feb. 2, 2015, the Prosecutor General’s Office seized personal property attributed to Zlochevsky but legally owned by his family, including a mansion, a luxury car and plots of land, according to AntAC. The court order was not published, but journalists eventually exposed what had happened later in 2015.

AD

Now here’s where it gets complicated. On Nov. 10, 2015, the Ukrainian parliament adopted a law amending the procedure for asset seizures, requiring higher standards of proof. The law came into force in December, and Zlochevsky appealed the seizure.

AD

In the meantime, that same month, the PGO tried to send its cases to another prosecutorial entity, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which is funded with U.S. and European aid and received technical support from the FBI. “NABU received tons of files in December 2015, just as their jurisdiction was starting,” said Daria Kaleniuk, the head of AntAC.

(During a December visit to Kyiv, Biden had addressed the Ukrainian parliament and decried the “cancer of corruption” in the country. “The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform,” he said. During that visit, he also privately urged Poroshenko to fire Shokin.)

AD

“There was a window of a few weeks when Zlochevsky’s lawyers sued to unseize the assets,” Kaleniuk told Birnbaum. “The court unseized the assets in December when the case was in between jurisdictions. The prosecutors didn’t even show up,” because they had no jurisdiction, since the case had been transferred from Shokin’s oversight, in the prosecutor general’s office, to NABU.

AD

So, on Dec. 25, 2015, the seizure was canceled. But the court order was not published until Jan. 27, 2016, and it prompted a public outcry, according to AntAC. So the PGO scrambled to get it reinstated, and the order was published Feb. 4, 2016.

When we asked Graham’s office why he thought there was a raid in February 2016, his office pointed us to a news account of the second court order. The article, however, references property “seized under the previous court ruling.”

AD

In other words, there was largely a technical reinstatement of a court order that already had been in place for at least a year. Matching up the assets listed in the July 2015 report and the February 2016 report, the main difference we see is the inclusion in 2016 of a Rolls-Royce and a trainer, though AntAC reports a luxury car was seized in 2015.

AD

Later in 2016, on Nov. 1, the seizure was canceled after the PGO closed the case, according to AntAC. The case over time had been turned into an investigation of possible tax avoidance, and a Burisma subsidiary paid back taxes.

As for Biden’s phone calls, the Obama administration regularly provided detailed readouts of the calls, so the topics are well-documented.

Feb. 11: Biden spoke to Poroshenko by phone. “The two leaders agreed on the importance of unity among Ukrainian political forces to quickly pass reforms in line with the commitments in its IMF program, including measures focused on rooting out corruption,” the White House said.

AD

Feb. 18: Another call took place between Biden and Poroshenko, two days after the president had announced he had asked Shokin to resign. “The Vice President also commended President Poroshenko’s decision to replace Prosecutor General Shokin, which paves the way for needed reform of the prosecutorial service,” the White House said in a statement.

AD

Feb. 19: Poroshenko announced he has received Shokin’s resignation letter. That same day, Biden spoke separately to Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. “He urged Ukraine’s leadership to unite and rebuild popular trust around a strong governing coalition and reform program, and to accelerate Ukraine’s efforts to fight corruption, strengthen justice and the rule of law, and fulfill its IMF requirements,” the White House said.

“I listened in to all the February calls. Until Nunes floated his wacky conspiracy theory, I’d never heard of the ‘raid’ — and nothing related to Burisma or Zlochevsky came up in any of those calls,” Colin H. Kahl, Biden’s national security adviser at the time, told The Fact Checker. “Unlike the current administration, we always read out our calls, and the call readouts captured the major topics of the conversations.”

AD

Anna Makanju, Biden’s senior policy adviser for Ukraine at the time, also listened to the calls and said release of the transcripts would only strengthen Biden’s case that he acted properly. She helped Biden prepare for the conversations and said they operated at a high level, with Biden using language such as Poroshenko’s government being “nation builders for a transformation of Ukraine.”

A reference to a private company such as Burisma would be “too fine a level of granularity” for a call between Biden and the president of another country, Makanju told The Fact Checker. Instead, she said, the conversation focused on reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund, methods to tackle corruption and military assistance. An investigation of “Burisma was just not significant enough” to mention, she said.

Pavlo Klimkin, Ukrainian foreign minister from 2014 until Aug. 29, 2019, told Birnbaum that the firing of Shokin was universally urged by Ukraine’s benefactors. “The demand came not just from the U.S., and not just from Biden,” he said. “I heard it in every meeting with the international financial institutions, especially the IMF and World Bank. It was not just Biden. Clearly.”

We reported our findings to Graham’s aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee and to a spokesman for Nunes on the House Intelligence Committee but did not receive an immediate response. Instead, out of the blue we received a phone call from John Solomon, a former Washington Post reporter who apparently was the source for Republicans. He said two people from Capitol Hill had alerted him to our inquiry.

Solomon acknowledged that there had been a seizure of assets in 2015 but said that on the basis of his interviews, such as with Shokin, and a review of court files, he believes some new assets were seized in February 2016. “My understanding is there was a reseizure and a new seizure of assets,” he said. “There was back and forth [in the courts], sure.”

Solomon added: “I am very careful to use the word ‘seizure.’ I don’t use the word ‘raid.’ ”

“The purpose of our investigation is to find out the truth of what the son of a former vice president of the United States was doing on the board of a Ukrainian gas company who was paying him $50,000 a month,” said Taylor Reidy, spokeswoman for the Senate Judiciary Committee. “He didn’t have any known experience in Ukraine or the oil and gas industry. But the company did appear to be running into legal issues regarding corruption. Our letter was the first step in our investigation, not the last. We expect additional requests for information as we learn more about these interactions and what was happening among the stakeholders.”

The Pinocchio Test

Republicans are clearly trying to connect some dots to give an impression of malfeasance by Biden. But they are looking at the wrong dots. Nothing significant appears to have happened in February 2016 except primarily the reinstatement of a previous court order. Instead, Zlochevsky’s assets had been seized a year earlier and were only briefly not under a court order because of a prosecutorial error.

In other words, there would have been no reason for Biden to raise the supposed raid of Zlochevsky’s home in his phone calls. Moreover, as we’ve shown, Biden’s aides at the time say that neither Burisma nor Zlochevsky was raised in the calls.

Shortly before 5 p.m. on November 15, Attorney General William P. Barr arrived at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., his owlish face wearing a heavy expression. He and his entourage rushed by the lobby bar, where a television was tuned to CNN’s coverage of another day of damning impeachment hearings and raging presidential tweets. Inside a gilded ballroom, hundreds of conservative lawyers — many of them, like Barr, veterans of previous Republican administrations — were gathered to hear him deliver an address to the annual conference of the Federalist Society. “It will come as little surprise to this group,” Barr began, “that I’ve chosen to speak about the Constitution’s approach to executive power.” Even by the standards of this brazen era in Washington, in which all subtext is banished, the theme of the evening was a little on-the-nose — a startlingly explicit case for strengthening Donald Trump’s hold on American government.

“The grammar-school-civics-class version of our Revolution is that it was a rebellion against monarchical tyranny, and that in framing our Constitution, one of the preoccupations, the main preoccupation of the Founders, was to keep the executive weak,” Barr told the audience. “This is misguided.” Instead, Barr advocates for what is known as the “unitary executive theory,” which challenges the long-established doctrine that the president’s control over his branch of government is shared, to some degree, with Congress and the courts. “Whenever I see a court opinion that uses the word share,” Barr said, “I want to run in the other direction.” Critics say that in its maximalist form, the theory is a license for authoritarianism — a concern that Barr dismissed with ridicule.

“One of the more amusing aspects of modern progressive polemic is their breathless attacks on the unitary executive theory,” Barr said. He paused for effect, waved his arms, and shouted ghoulishly: “Bwaaaaaaaaaa!” He recounted his own confirmation hearing, at which Democratic senators pressed him to explain his muscular philosophy. “This is not ‘new,’ and it’s not a ‘theory,’” Barr said. If anything, he argued, the president’s rightful power had been stolen, a view shaped by his personal history. Barr started his career as a CIA analyst in 1973 in the midst of Watergate. At the time, the Agency was besieged by revelations of its misdeeds, congressional investigations, and political battles over regulation of intelligence activities. But where others saw the post-Watergate reforms as a triumph of accountability, Barr viewed them as the beginning of a constitutional wrong turn. At the Mayflower, he spoke of the “steady grinding down of the executive branch’s authority that accelerated after Watergate,” now exacerbated by partisan conflict.

“Immediately after President Trump won election, opponents inaugurated what they called the resistance,” Barr said. “They rallied around an explicit strategy of using every tool and maneuver to sabotage the functioning of the executive branch and his administration. Now, ‘resistance’ is the language used to describe insurgency against rule imposed by an occupying military power. It obviously connotes that the government is not legitimate. This is a very dangerous and indeed incendiary notion to import into the politics of a democratic republic.” Without mentioning the impeachment hearings, Barr accused Democrats in Congress of using “constant harassment” to “incapacitate the executive branch” and the administration’s agenda. Those who accused Trump of acting like an anti-democratic menace, Barr said, had it backward. “In waging a scorched-earth, no-holds-barred war of resistance against this administration,” he said, “it is the left that is engaged in a systematic shredding of norms and undermining the rule of law.”

Barr’s message was met with applause in the room and a savage reaction outside it. On social media, liberal commentators howled in protest, while his most important audience, @realDonaldTrump, retweeted a video clip of his attack on the resistance. A few days afterward, Checks and Balances, a group of conservative lawyers and scholars who oppose Trump, issued a statement calling his “autocratic vision” ahistorical and contrary to the Constitution. Barr was untroubled.

“Generally, no one really cares what they think,” Barr said of the Checks and Balances crowd when we met the week of Thanksgiving amid the wood-paneled grandeur of his office suite on the fifth floor of the Justice Department headquarters. In person, on a darkening fall afternoon, the 69-year-old was subdued, his voice softened almost to a mumble. Barr claims to ignore the newspapers and social media, and whether that is entirely true, he certainly occupies his position with a comfort that eluded his immediate predecessor, Jeff Sessions. Barr knew the office well, having served as attorney general once before during the presidency of George H.W. Bush. He said he returned to government, after nearly 30 years, with the objective of restoring order.

“People who had a lot of antipathy toward Trump seemed to be willing to go to any lengths to injure his administration,” Barr said. “I felt that was unfair and harmful to the system and important institutions, including the presidency, and I felt there should be people in the Department of Justice to help navigate through these times.”

As attorney general, Barr is at once the nation’s chief prosecutor and the president’s highest-ranking legal counselor, an inherently conflicted role when the president is accused of wrongdoing. But over the past year, with bureaucratic dexterity and bluff self-assurance, Barr has effectively turned the Justice Department to face down Trump’s adversaries. In the spring, he brought a muffled conclusion to special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, managing the release of his report in a way that limited its impact and declaring the evidence did not show Trump committed obstruction of justice. Barr then initiated a secretive internal probe of the origins of the Russia investigation, headed by veteran prosecutor John Durham, who is scrutinizing the FBI and CIA. Barr, who claims there was “spying” on Trump’s campaign, has played a hands-on role in Durham’s work, traveling the world to convince foreign intelligence services to cooperate in his investigation of the investigation.

His performance appears to have earned Trump’s confidence to a rare degree. In the phone call with Ukraine’s president that set off impeachment, the president mentioned Barr in the same breath as his attorney Rudy Giuliani. Barr was reportedly angry when he heard about the call, though, and in fairness, he is nobody’s personal fixer. Rather, Barr is an intimidatingly competent governmental operator — a man who “knows the levers,” as one former Trump-administration Justice official put it. A better comparison, often made by Barr’s peers, is to Dick Cheney. Barr appreciates power, and he knows how to wield it.

As the Durham probe, the ongoing impeachment drama, and the presidential campaign play out in the coming months, Barr will occupy a crucial position. While crowds chant “Lock her up” and “Lock him up,” he holds the keys to the prying powers of law enforcement. To give just one example, Barr is ultimately overseeing the investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan that is reportedly zeroing in on Giuliani and his efforts to dig dirt and do business in Ukraine. He will potentially have a say when the president decides whether to pardon convicted associates like Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Presuming he remains in the president’s favor — never a sure bet — he will be advising Trump through a reelection year that is certain to revolve around allegations of Trump’s corruption. Barr’s analysis of Trump’s presidency is right in at least one respect: As much as the president likes to play autocrat on Twitter, hurling orders and threatening his enemies, so far, he has actually been quite weak — constrained by Congress, the courts, protests, and, often, his own administration’s incompetence. It is Barr who will be guiding him as he goes forward, determined to test the bounds of his power.

When Trump nominated Barr to be attorney general in December 2018, some foes of the president, glancing at Barr’s experience, his many personal connections to the Justice Department, and the array of former deputies and protégés he had seeded all over the Republican legal Establishment, jumped to the conclusion that he might prove to be a nuisance to the president. “All my friends, they projected their feelings onto Bill, believing him to be an institutionalist who would ‘stand up to Trump,’ ” says an academic who once worked with Barr. “I warned everybody: ‘Don’t do that.’ ”

In fact, Barr could hardly have been more explicit in indicating what he believed and what he would do when the president sent him to the Justice Department. “I think it started picking up after Watergate,” Barr said in a 2001 interview for a University of Virginia oral-history project on the first Bush administration, “the idea that the Department of Justice has to be ‘independent.’ ” Barr thinks it is not just impossible but undesirable for prosecutors to operate independently of politics. “Career people are just as capable of acting politically with a small p, and I think, at the end of the day, if you’re making a decision, it should be made by people who are accountable,” Barr told me. “Our system puts political appointees in that position. That’s why we have elections.” Barr has said that criminal investigations — especially the most important ones — require “political supervision,” and he has contended that the Constitution grants the president “illimitable” authority over law enforcement, even if it is scrutinizing the White House.

Like his boss, Barr is the product of a privileged New York upbringing — his father was a memorably authoritarian headmaster at Dalton — who rebelled against his hometown’s liberal culture. Not long after joining the CIA, Barr transferred to the Agency’s internal legal office and started taking law classes at night. He caught the eye of the then–CIA director, George H.W. Bush. Years later, as president, Bush gave Barr his first job at Justice, naming him to head the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). The office offers guidance on the legality of executive actions, which gives it great influence in government, especially in national-security matters. (A former head of the office once said its role was to “dispense get-out-of-jail-free cards.”)

At his Senate-confirmation hearing, in 1989, Barr described the formative effect of his CIA experience, while the then–Judiciary Committee chairman, Joe Biden, pressed the issue of his “independence.” Biden advised Barr to ignore the “pull and tug” of the Oval Office in forming his legal opinions and asked him about the “genius of the system of checks and balances.”

“It is a very broad issue, what are my views of the separation of powers,” Barr said.

“Start anywhere you like,” Biden replied.

“Well,” Barr said, “let us start with Aristotle.”

Barr went on to offer a pithy encapsulation of the history of representative government, touching on the Greeks, the Romans, and the Founders, before concluding with the observation that separation “doesn’t lead to the most efficient government, but over the long run the freest government.” For all his conciliatory intellectual rhetoric, though, Barr had been given a confrontational mission to expand presidential authority. “All of us, coming out of Watergate, felt that Congress had taken more than its proper share of power back,” says C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel at the time. He says he recommended Barr because he wanted an ally at the OLC who believed in the theory of the unitary executive.

Soon after Barr was confirmed, he issued a memorandum targeting a list of “encroachments” on executive authority, including the independent-counsel law, a post-Watergate reform that protected political investigations from interference. Barr disliked the law because he thought an independent prosecutor, with a single focus, could easily run rampant, pursuing phantom crimes. Even among Republicans who believed in a strong president, some of Barr’s positions were extreme. “Bill’s answer was uniformly that the president gets what he wants,” says Douglas Kmiec, Barr’s immediate OLC predecessor, who now teaches constitutional law at Pepperdine University. “I think a good number of us from OLC said, ‘Wait a minute.’ ”

Barr turned his small office into an ideological engine room staffed by like-minded young conservatives and fought internal battles with the more-moderate factions of the Bush administration. Some senior officials referred to Barr and his deputy as “the bulldogs.” Barr was known for his infinite confidence, but he occasionally outsmarted himself. Journalist Jan Crawford, in her book Supreme Conflict, writes that when a seat opened on the Supreme Court in 1990, OLC attorneys worked all night to prepare a memo that would sink the leading candidate, Kenneth Starr, a colleague Barr considered “maddeningly squishy.” The seat instead went to David Souter, the favorite of Bush’s chief of staff, who turned out to be a reliable liberal vote.

Barr impressed Bush, though, and after an unusually quick scramble up the rungs of the department, he was named attorney general in 1991 at the age of 41. His primary preoccupation was violent crime, which was then seen as an epidemic. Unlike many who come into the position, Barr had little previous experience with law enforcement, so he assembled a leadership team of seasoned prosecutors. The head of his criminal division was a square-jawed ex-Marine, Robert Mueller. Barr advocated punitive measures to fight gangs and gun offenses, and the department produced a report with the now-infamous title “The Case for More Incarceration.” His crime crackdown had bipartisan support. Barr and Biden cooperated. “I think it’s pretty fair to say that Bill charmed Joe Biden,” says Timothy Flanigan, who worked under Barr in the OLC. Biden invited the Barr family up to visit his home in Delaware.

Much of Barr’s tenure coincided with the 1992 election campaign. Like every attorney general, he faced decisions with political implications, and he was unapologetic about looking out for Bush’s interests. When a coup in Haiti caused throngs of refugees to flee in boats, Barr set a policy of intercepting them at sea and detaining them at Guantánamo Bay, outside the purview of U.S. immigration laws. The policy caused a clash with military leaders, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. In the oral-history interview, Barr said his attitude was: “You want 80,000 Haitians to descend on Florida several months before the election? Come on, give me a break.”

Bill Clinton ran on an economic message, but Bush would blame his defeat on a political investigation. On the Friday before the election, Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel probing the Iran-Contra scandal, issued an indictment that included new details about Bush’s role. The news dominated the last days of the race. “Walsh abused his power!” Bush complained to Barr the day after the election, according to Bob Woodward’s book Shadow. On his way out of office, Bush wanted to put an end to the long-running investigation. Under the independent-counsel statute, Walsh could be fired for misconduct, a move Barr considered. But he and Bush settled on another solution. Bush simply pardoned all the Iran-Contra defendants.

In the final stage of the campaign, Barr was presented with an opportunity to exercise the kind of political supervision he believed prosecutors required. On a flight to a ceremony with other administration officials, a White House aide informed him, cryptically, of a rumor about a case down in Arkansas involving a savings-and-loan and Bill Clinton. Barr did some digging and discovered that the U.S. Attorney in Little Rock was sitting on a criminal referral that mentioned Clinton and a failed real-estate venture called the Whitewater Development Corporation. The prosecutor, a Republican, found the case flimsy, and the referral described Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses, not suspects. But Barr had been told that the prosecutor’s conclusion was “cutting them a lot of slack,” he later testified in a deposition, and he decided to “get the case on the right track” by escalating it to Washington. Mueller held a meeting with FBI officials and told them to investigate aggressively, just as in any other bank-fraud case. The Arkansas prosecutor fired off an angry letter, saying the “insistence for urgency” suggested an “attempt to intervene into the political process of the upcoming presidential election.”

Barr dictated that the investigation would proceed, but in secret, so as not to interfere with the election. “Later, a number of Republicans said, ‘Well, hell, why didn’t you? You would’ve saved the country,’ ” Barr told me. He laughed, since we both knew how the story ended for Clinton. With the complaint revived, the FBI continued to investigate the Whitewater case after Barr was gone. Political investigations burn on a long fuse. An independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, took over the inquiry, and it went in unanticipated directions.

Just one year ago, Barr was semi-retired and semi-obscure, practicing law in Washington and living in McLean, Virginia, the deep state’s suburban home. After his relatively brief stint as attorney general ended with Bush’s defeat, he left government at an age young enough to embark on a whole second career. He became general counsel at a small telephone company, GTE, which he helped to guide through a series of mergers and acquisitions as it morphed into Verizon. He gained deep knowledge of regulation and antitrust law and made a considerable fortune. (Forbes has estimated his net worth at $40 million.) In 2008, Barr took an early retirement from Verizon and went on to a comfortable position at a prominent Washington law firm.

All three of his daughters, who attended his first Senate-confirmation hearing in their Sunday best, grew up to be government lawyers, and two of them have worked for the Justice Department. (So have two of his sons-in-law.) Barr himself never completely left the orbit of the department. He still socialized with old colleagues, like Mueller and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who often attended the Barr family’s Scottish-themed Christmas parties. (Barr likes to play the bagpipes.) Barr sometimes called up to offer input to his successors. After 9/11, for instance, Barr suggested the idea of using military commissions to try captured terrorists.

Barr supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 primaries, but unlike many of his contemporaries, he never voiced opposition to Trump. However, he did watch, with growing horror, as the result of the election threw the Justice Department into disarray. Democrats blamed FBI director James Comey for sinking Hillary Clinton’s presidential run, in part, by mishandling the FBI’s investigation into her emails. Meanwhile, in secret, the Bureau had launched a counterintelligence investigation, code-named “Crossfire Hurricane,” into suspected Russian attempts to swing the campaign for Trump. When that news broke after Trump’s election, some in Barr’s world of Justice Department alumni were troubled by the prospect — however remote — that Trump might be a Russian tool. But Barr’s faction of the community was pulsing with an alternative set of suspicions, focusing on the motives of those who initiated the investigation.

“It was apparent to all of us that there was a ‘Get Trump’ attitude in the leadership of the FBI,” says George Terwilliger, a longtime friend of Barr’s who served as his deputy attorney general in the 1990s. During the early stages of Trump’s presidency, Terwilliger was speaking to Barr a few times a week. “I know he was extremely concerned,” Terwilliger says. They both saw evidence of political bias in disclosures about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two key figures in the FBI who were having an affair amid Crossfire Hurricane and exchanging anti-Trump text messages, which Barr has deemed “appalling.” And both found it suspicious that Comey and the FBI were relying on information gathered in the Steele dossier, which was funded by Trump’s political opponents.

In 2017, the Russia investigation appeared to pose a serious threat to Trump’s presidency. After Trump fired Comey, Mueller was appointed by the DOJ as special prosecutor. He spent the summer assembling an aggressive staff and issuing search warrants. Trump and his family sought to bolster the president’s defense team. They approached Barr through an intermediary, David Friedman — the former Trump bankruptcy attorney who is now the ambassador to Israel — and asked if he would be interested in joining. Barr declined. “I didn’t want to stick my head into that meat grinder,” Barr later testified. But he agreed to meet with Trump at the White House the next morning. In the Oval Office, Trump pressed Barr for his personal impressions of Mueller. “I told him how well I knew Bob Mueller and … the Barrs and Muellers were good friends and would be good friends when this is all over,” Barr testified. “Bob is a straight shooter and should be dealt with as such.”

Barr has made much of his personal relationship with Mueller, letting it be known that their wives attend Bible study together, and Mueller was a guest at two of his daughters’ weddings. It is a shield against any suggestion he would set out to undermine the investigation. But his full opinion of Mueller, according to people who know both men, is more complicated. Over their long relationship, Barr was always the alpha. Former colleagues say that while Barr respected Mueller, he saw him as an able prosecutor, not a brilliant legal mind. “I doubt it would be any surprise to Bill to learn or conclude that Bob’s staff was driving the train much more than Bob was,” said one person who has worked with both men. When Mueller was his subordinate in the 1990s, Barr would often subject him to intellectual hazing.

“Bill was always making fun of people in his meetings, and Mueller was a particular target of his fun,” recalls another former colleague. “Mueller would say things that were kind of stupid at times, and Bill would just mercilessly make fun of him.”

As the investigation developed, Barr grew convinced Mueller required guidance. News reports were hinting that the prosecutors were pursuing a theory that by firing Comey and publicly attacking the “witch hunt,” Trump had obstructed justice. Barr thought that Mueller’s “novel” obstruction theory, as he later described it, was a constitutionally dangerous path, and so on a snowy day in early 2018, he went to visit the DOJ’s headquarters, a monumental building known as Main Justice, to lunch with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Because Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation, Rosenstein had appointed Mueller and was responsible for overseeing his work. Like Sessions, Rosenstein had a tortured relationship with Trump. It was later reported that Rosenstein was so alarmed after Comey’s firing that he offered to wear a wire to a White House meeting. (There is dispute about whether he was joking.)

The two men ordered in Chinese food and discussed a variety of topics, including the Mueller investigation and its focus on Comey’s firing. Barr told Rosenstein it would be wrong and crippling to criminalize a president’s decisions to remove top officials, which were part of his constitutional duties. As he made his case, he recalled, Rosenstein was “sphinxlike in his reaction.” So Barr decided to follow up in writing.

Mueller would say things that were kind of stupid at times, and Bill would just mercilessly make fun of him.

Barr’s concerns about a politically unaccountable FBI have some historical grounding — think of J. Edgar Hoover, so feared he effectively had tenure for life. Barr later said he was afraid that Trump’s case could have “a chilling effect” on the president’s role in law enforcement. He put his thinking into a long memo, which he sent to Rosenstein and the head of the OLC. “I know you will agree that, if a DOJ investigation is going to take down a democratically elected president,” Barr wrote, “it is imperative to the health of our system and to our national cohesion that any claim of wrongdoing is solidly based on evidence of a real crime — not a debatable one.” He urged the officials not to “indulge the fancies by overly zealous prosecutors.”

Barr conceded that a president could obstruct justice through specific bad acts, like destroying evidence, but he said he otherwise had “necessarily all-encompassing” authority over law enforcement. “He alone is the Executive branch,” Barr wrote, citing a Supreme Court decision. “While the president has subordinates — the Attorney General and DOJ lawyers — who exercise prosecutorial discretion on his behalf, they are merely ‘his hand.’ ”

Barr wanted his message to reach Mueller, and he put it in many bottles. He shared the memo widely with Justice Department alumni, academics, and members of Trump’s legal team, which included Emmet Flood, the attorney who oversaw the final stages of the Mueller investigation inside the White House counsel’s office. When Sessions resigned that November, Flood advocated for Barr to be his replacement. “I think he presented himself to the president as the guy who could get it done,” says one former Trump-administration DOJ official, “and solve the problem that was confronting the president.”

While some have said his memo looked like a job application, Barr has called the suggestion “ludicrous.” Friends say he agreed to join the administration only reluctantly. The final push came at a retreat for a CIA advisory board he served on. “At that retreat,” Barr said, “there were a lot of Democratic businessmen and others, and they were talking about the importance of having the department in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing.” Still, many friends were surprised that he would expose himself to the daily animosity of politics, as well as the potential for humiliation by Trump, who ridiculed Sessions without mercy. On his first day on the job, at a Rose Garden ceremony where Trump signed an emergency declaration allowing him to build his border wall over congressional objections, the president singled out Barr and said, a tad ominously: “Enjoy your life.”

“He says that a lot,” Barr said with a grin.

Unlike Sessions, Barr commanded immediate respect at Main Justice, where his bureaucratic expertise allowed him to take control. Already, some of the initial chaos ushered in by Trump’s presidency had begun to subside, as conservative political appointees asserted themselves and many career attorneys who had joined during the Obama administration gave up and left. “As time progressed, loyalty became the dominant mentality,” says Erica Newland, an OLC attorney who quit shortly before Barr arrived. Barr’s department has pressed Trump’s policies on a variety of fronts, from immigration (for instance, by curtailing rights to asylum), to drugs (Barr’s daughter Mary headed the DOJ’s opioid enforcement initiative for a time), to technology (pressuring companies for backdoors to encryption), to crime. After nearly two decades, Barr resumed the use of the federal death penalty; the first execution is scheduled for December 9 (pending appeals). The department has fought subpoenas to reveal information about Trump’s tax returns and other politically charged issues.

Barr’s first order of business, though, was dealing with the Mueller report. When Barr finally had a chance to talk to Mueller, in March, he said he was surprised to learn the special counsel was coming to a non-decision on the obstruction issue. Mueller turned in his 448-page report soon afterward, presenting a highly damaging picture of Trump’s actions but declining to come to a “traditional prosecutorial judgment.” Barr temporarily withheld the report from Congress and the public, citing the need for careful redactions. Instead, he issued a short summary of Mueller’s findings, offering his own conclusion that the evidence of obstruction was “not sufficient” and eliding an — admittedly confusing — legal nuance. Because of an OLC opinion that said the president could not be indicted while in office, Mueller had reasoned that it would be unfair to accuse Trump of committing a crime with no opportunity to defend himself in court. He seemed to imply that it was up to Congress to indict him via impeachment.

Barr’s favorable summary met with protest from Democrats and recriminations from Mueller’s office, which complained that the report’s findings had been mischaracterized. (Barr later called Mueller’s reaction “a bit snitty” and blamed the special counsel’s staff.) But the whole controversy served to blunt the force of the full report when it arrived weeks later. A furious House Speaker Nancy Pelosi threatened to hold Barr in criminal contempt, claiming he had lied to Congress about his dealings with Mueller over the report. Barr laughed off both the allegation and the symbolic action. “Madam Speaker,” Barr asked when they encountered each other at a Capitol Hill ceremony soon afterward, “did you bring your handcuffs?”

Barr’s defenders say that he did eventually release the report, which was not legally required, and it is not his fault if the public didn’t read it or get outraged. In a final bid to galvanize public opinion, House Democrats summoned a reluctant Mueller to testify in July. But the hearings were an anticlimax, as Mueller seemed fumbling and uncertain under questioning. His old colleagues from the Justice Department, even ones who are critical of Barr, say they thought Mueller looked aged — not like the man they knew. Fairly or not, the shaky performance reinforced the rumors that the revered prosecutor, who is now 75, was not fully in control of his investigation.

“Bill Barr might have been the only person in the country conversant with how Bob would actually come across,” says Douglas Kmiec, who overlapped with both of them in the Justice Department 30 years ago. “The rest of us, without the same familiarity, kept seeing the same picture of Bob Mueller as the man of steel.”

The day after Mueller testified, Trump called the president of Ukraine, setting up the next episode in his police-procedural presidency. “That whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine,” Trump said, according to the reconstructed transcript. “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.” A great deal hinges on what the definition of the word it is. Trump seemed to be conflating two investigations: John Durham’s probe into the origins of the Russia investigation and Giuliani’s intrigues, focused on surfacing damaging information about Joe and Hunter Biden. The fact that Trump apparently saw them as a single agenda item may be careless talk or evidence of a deeper connection in his mind between the two efforts, both focused on his enemies.

“I’ve had zero conversation with Ukraine,” Barr told me, reaffirming a statement the Justice Department put out in September, which also said Trump had never brought up investigating Biden with Barr. The Justice Department played an important role, however, in the effort to keep the contents of the call from becoming public after the fact. In August, after the White House informed the department of the whistle-blower’s complaint, the OLC issued an opinion that said it could be withheld from Congress on the grounds that the applicable law did not cover presidential misconduct. The department also determined Trump had not broken campaign-finance laws. After the complaint came out, the Washington Post recently reported, Trump wanted his attorney general to go even further by holding a press conference to declare him innocent and was upset that Barr refused.

But Barr has extended himself to a surprising degree in chasing the president’s suspicions. In May, shortly after the Mueller report was released, he discounted its findings of extensive Russian efforts to contact and influence the Trump campaign. “There is no evidence of a conspiracy,” Barr told Jan Crawford in an in-depth interview for CBS News. “So it was bogus, this whole idea that Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus.” He blamed “a small group at the top” of the FBI and painted their actions in apocalyptic terms. “I mean, republics have fallen because of [a] Praetorian Guard mentality,” he said, “where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences, and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion is somehow an enemy of the state.” Crawford asked if the investigators’ actions in pursuing Crossfire Hurricane might amount to “treason,” the word Trump has used. Barr said only, “Not as a legal matter.”

The same month, Barr appointed Durham to investigate the investigation. The dimensions of what the prosecutor had been assigned to do were unclear, but as the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, Durham had no obvious political bias. He had served both Democratic and Republican presidents, prosecuting many tough mob and public-corruption cases, and had a reputation for extreme secrecy. During the Obama administration, he conducted a highly classified investigation of the CIA’s alleged use of torture. Over the past few months, Trump allies like Michael Mukasey, a former Republican attorney general whose official portrait hangs in Barr’s office, have fanned speculation that Durham is onto something. “He is an experienced and principled prosecutor,” Mukasey wrote in The Wall Street Journal in September. “Stay tuned.”

What could Durham be looking into? Barr initially questioned the evidence supporting the FBI’s secret warrant for electronic surveillance on Carter Page, the Trump campaign’s foreign-policy adviser, along with other unspecified breaks with “normal procedures” at the FBI. In May, he told CBS that he had asked questions about the FBI’s actions in 2016, and the answers he received were “just not jiving.” More recent indications suggest that the probe has since broadened in scope to examine not just the FBI but also the CIA. In late October, the New York Times reported that Durham’s work, originally classified vaguely as an “administrative review,” was now a criminal investigation, allowing him to issue subpoenas and convene a grand jury, a step that could be routine or something more.

In late September, as all of Washington was poring over the CIA whistle-blower’s complaint, Barr was in Rome, meeting with government counterparts, reportedly including the chief of Italy’s intelligence agency, to assure their cooperation with Durham. Barr has also sought assistance from Australia and Great Britain, and the department has said Durham talked to “certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government.” According to an anonymous British official recently quoted in the Independent, Barr’s inquiries have been “like nothing we have come across before, they are basically asking, in quite robust terms, for help in doing a hatchet job on their own intelligence services.”

“That’s all bullshit,” Barr said to me in his office of the skepticism surrounding his overseas meetings, which he said were necessary under the circumstances. “This is a case where we’re asking for assistance and information, some of which is sensitive or classified information.”

It would be easy to dismiss Durham’s probe as a fool’s errand simply because some unserious people are taking it seriously, but there are legitimate questions to be asked about how the FBI conducted itself, like: Why didn’t the Bureau try to warn Trump’s campaign it was afraid the Russians were trying to compromise the candidate before it launched a counterintelligence operation? (Naming it Crossfire Hurricane does convey a gunslinging mentality.) Barr has defended his use of the term spying to describe the FBI’s actions, calling it a “perfectly good English word,” and has said the use of surveillance against a campaign is “a serious red line that’s been crossed.” Defenders of the FBI’s handling of the investigation say that any irregularities were the result of panic, not politics, and that the prospect of foreign infiltration of a presidential campaign presented an extraordinary threat calling for extraordinary vigilance. Fragmentary reports about the findings of a just-completed report by the Justice Department’s inspector general, examining some of the same issues and scheduled to be released December 9, say it concludes that the FBI’s decision to launch the counterintelligence investigation was justified based on the evidence it had. But Barr is said to disagree with the report’s conclusions, feeling that Durham has found information that deserves further investigation and contending that agencies outside the purview of the DOJ’s internal watchdog, such as the CIA, may have important undisclosed information.

In their Italian trips, Barr and Durham reportedly showed interest in evidence pertaining to Joseph Mifsud, a mysterious Russia-connected professor who tipped off a Trump adviser about the hacking and release of Democratic emails in early 2016. Mifsud is also a fixture of right-wing conspiracy theories, which postulate that he was an agent not of Russia but the CIA and somehow working against Trump. On December 4, the Washington Post reported that the inspector general’s report uncovered no evidence to support the theory that Mifsud was a CIA asset and questioned whether Durham had, either.

Barr’s critics contend he merely wants to keep asking questions until he finds the answer Trump wants or at least confuses the issue politically. In the darkest light, Durham’s investigation looks like a way for Trump to undermine the impeachment inquiry — which, after all, emanated from the CIA — while also holding the threat of punishment over those he has already purged, like Strzok, Comey, and Comey’s deputy Andrew McCabe. “It’s worse than even I anticipated,” says Neil Kinkopf, a liberal legal scholar who warned of the “breathtaking scope” of Barr’s theory of presidential power at his Senate-confirmation hearing. “I think I was at the extreme end of bad, but even I did not anticipate him acting as the president’s political lawyer.”

“What’s political for one side is law enforcement for the other,” says one of Barr’s aides. “It depends on where you sit. But you follow the law to where it goes.” In some cases, the law goes to uncomfortable places for Trump. Early this year, for instance, Barr was briefed on an investigation being conducted by the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which was looking into a pair of Giuliani associates who were then in the midst of helping him pressure a prosecutor in Ukraine to announce an investigation of a gas company with which Hunter Biden was involved. In October, the two men were hurriedly arrested at Dulles airport, shortly after meeting Giuliani at Trump’s hotel in Washington. They were charged with lying about their political donations, which included a $325,000 contribution to a Trump-aligned super-PAC. Subpoenas in that case have lately reached into Trump’s fund-raising and many other potentially embarrassing areas.

Although the Southern District is unofficially known as the Sovereign District, because it operates with stubborn autonomy, it is still an office of the Justice Department, reporting to the attorney general. So far, the investigation has proceeded without publicly reported interference, even as prosecutors have reportedly focused on Giuliani himself. Barr is said to have little affection for Trump’s increasingly erratic private attorney. But even so, he has argued, in his 2018 memo, that the president has “absolute” discretion to place “his thumb on the scale in favor of lenity” — meaning Trump could, in theory, ask him to take it easy on his friend Rudy. When I asked Barr if there were any limits, outside of illegality, on what the president could instruct him to do, he told me he and Trump had set strict ground rules. “Right from the very beginning,” Barr said, “the president made clear to me, and we discussed, that he will not get into the business of talking about, or asking me, either to pursue, or not to pursue, cases. He leaves that up to my judgment.”

Still, if there is one thing that is now clear about Barr, it is that he carries out orders. Both his friends and his critics accept that he is motivated less by a desire to protect this individual president than to reinforce the institution of the presidency, especially and not coincidentally in periods when the executive branch is controlled by the Republican Party. “He’s come to this theory that the presidency should be all-powerful,” says Donald Ayer, a Justice Department official in the first Bush administration who belongs to Checks and Balances. “And here you have a president who is going to afford you, by his blunderbuss behavior, a lot of context in which you can push or test your theory.”

A few days before I met Barr, Trump had given a rambling interview to Fox & Friends. He had talked up the Justice Department’s ongoing counter-investigation led by Durham like a wrestler promoting a showdown, predicting that “Bull Durham” would soon reveal a plot to “overthrow the presidency” and thereby help to prove the corruption of the entire impeachment “scam.” I asked Barr how that fit into their ground rules.

Barr blinked quizzically. He seemed to be genuinely unaware of the Fox interview, which had burned up social media. His staffers hurriedly tried to brief him.

“There’s a movie, Bull Durham — ” his chief of staff began.

“Yeah, yeah,” Barr said. He knew that part.

“I’ll just say it again,” Barr told me, reverting to a practiced answer. “I don’t pay attention to the tweets. If he has something to say to me, he’ll say it to me directly.”

In a statement long on quotes from the Founding Fathers and short on details, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced on Thursday morning that she had asked the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

While she did not specifically address the question of the scope of these articles, her statement, like the impeachment proceedings so far, focused mostly on impeachment as the sole and proper remedy for a president selling out national interests in dealing with foreign governments. That would suggest a principal article of impeachment focused on the “favor” Trump asked Ukraine’s president to do for him and its intended effect of helping Trump get reelected by lowering a Ukrainian boom on Joe Biden. But since the Mueller report’s elaborate presentation of evidence of presidential obstruction of justice also involved an investigation into foreign meddling in the 2016 election, an article or articles dealing with those offenses would be within the scope of an impeachment drive focused on Trump’s relationship with foreign governments. And Pelosi did briefly mention the president’s efforts to subvert Congress’ role as a co-equal branch of government, so an article on obstruction of Congress via defiance of subpoenas would be in order, too.

The important thing to remember is that these three subjects for articles of impeachment — the Ukraine scandal, obstruction of congressional efforts to investigate the Ukraine scandal, and obstruction of the Russia investigation — have already been thoroughly aired publicly, which means the Judiciary Committee can move quickly on them. And the Washington Post is reporting that in a House Democratic Caucus meeting on Wednesday, Pelosi sounded committed to her original Christmas deadline for finishing up impeachment:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff left little doubt with fellow Democrats Wednesday that they plan to move swiftly to impeach President Trump as soon as this month …

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff left little doubt with fellow Democrats Wednesday that they plan to move swiftly to impeach President Trump as soon as this month.

The caucus, according to multiple members, erupted with shouts of approval.

At the Judiciary Committee’s impeachment hearing on Tuesday, Republicans (and the witness they called) agitated the air incessantly about the speed with which House Democrats are moving towards impeachment. As is his habit, the president undercut his defenders pretty decisively in a pair of early-morning tweets:

The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2019

.....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2019

So the race is on. Current plans are that other committee chairmen — notably Adam Schiff — will present their committees’ findings on impeachable offenses to the Judiciary Committee next week, and formal articles will be unveiled the week of December 16 at the latest and approved quickly by the Judiciary Committee, where there’s no reason to expect anything other than a strict party-line vote. At that point there will be just nine shopping days left before Christmas, and even less time for the House to debate and vote on impeachment of the president. Everyone can only hope there’s not a government shutdown right in the middle of the impeachment drama."

Yesterday, Devin Nunes, the comically litigious congressional Republican who has orchestrated President Trump’s defenses in the Russia and Ukraine scandals, filed another lawsuit — this time against CNN, for reporting Lev Parnas’s allegations that Nunes had met with a Ukrainian oligarch. “CNN was well-aware that Parnas was a renowned liar, a fraudster, a hustler,” charges Nunes. Parnas is so dishonest and disreputable, argues Nunes, that CNN was irresponsible even to publish his allegations.

In a highly inconvenient coincidence of timing, within hours of Nunes’s lawsuit, the House Intelligence Committee published a report on the scandal that included new phone records. These records show that Nunes and Parnas have spoken on the phone several times.

It seems like a weird choice for Nunes to have taken a bunch of calls with a known liar, fraudster, and hustler. Nunes habitually refuses to answer questions from journalists about his activities. Instead he appeared last night on Sean Hannity. “Did you ever talk to this guy Les Parnas, or whatever his name is?” asked the Fox News host. (That Lev Parnas, who met repeatedly with the president and worked closely for months with his lawyer, has now been demoted to “this guy” indicates how much trouble he poses now that he is cooperating with law enforcement.)

“You know it’s possible,” replied Nunes, “but I haven’t gone through all my phone records.” It’s possible? The House Intelligence Committee has gone through the phone records! Nunes is on the records! This isn’t a hypothetical question!

Nunes’s lawsuit does not deny reporting by CNN — or by the Daily Beast, which he also previously threatened to sue — that he worked with Parnas to discredit Joe Biden. Instead it focuses on Parnas’s claim that Nunes met in Vienna with Viktor Shokin, the corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor who has spread pro-Republican conspiracy theories. Nunes denies having met with Shokin, or having traveled to Vienna during the time in question. It shows a series of photographs of Nunes in Malta and Libya.

It is certainly possible that Parnas’s secondhand account of this meeting is false. Unfortunately for Nunes, his lawsuit relies on the theory that CNN was negligent to publish an allegation by Parnas who is a notorious criminal and liar, yet Nunes himself consulted with Parnas on several occasions.

To date, the only defense to emerge from the Nunesphere is the suggestion that maybe the person speaking to Parnas on Nunes’s phone all those times was somebody other than Devin Nunes:

The House Intelligence Committee also has some bad news for Nunes’s former aide, Kash Patel. In October, the New York Times reported that Patel, whose official role is supposed to concern counterterrorism, helped direct Ukraine policy (specifically, Trump’s scheme to leverage Ukraine for political gain). Patel sued the Times, denying he had “played a role in shadow foreign policy.” Unfortunately for Patel, the House report has call records showing his number too:

Call records also show that around midday on May 10, Mr. Giuliani began trading aborted calls with Kashyap “Kash” Patel, an official at the National Security Council who previously served on Ranking Member Devin Nunes’ staff on the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Patel successfully connected with Mr. Giuliani less than an hour after Mr. Giuliani’s call with Ambassador Volker. Beginning at 3:23 p.m., Eastern Time, Mr. Patel and Mr. Giuliani spoke for over 25 minutes. Five minutes after Mr. Patel and Mr. Giuliani disconnected, an unidentified “-1” number connected with Mr. Giuliani for over 17 minutes. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Giuliani spoke with Mr. Parnas for approximately 12 minutes.

The records don’t say what Patel discussed with Giuliani, but the timing sure seems to indicate that the subject was Ukraine.

One might get the impression that the whole Nunes operation revolves around generating wild lies to defend Trump, funneling those lies through right-wing propaganda outlets, and bullying news organizations who debunk the lies with expensive lawsuits designed to intimidate them."

When Kamala Harris announced her presidential campaign in January, Rachel Maddow told her, “I think there is a good chance that you are going to win the nomination.” Soon after, Harris’s 20,000-plus-person kickoff rally in Oakland exceeded expectations set by party chiefs who saw in her an aspirational candidate who could represent the heart of the party both ideologically and demographically. Six months later, when the California senator challenged Joe Biden onstage at the first debate in Miami — surprising everyone, and delivering the most memorable lines of the campaign — her moment seemed to arrive.

But Harris was uneasy even as she vaulted toward the field’s top tier in the ensuing days. She cringed at how the coverage was painting her as the race’s anti-Biden attack artist, not as a nimble realist able to build consensus between the party’s warring factions, as she believed herself to be. She hesitated as some advisors encouraged her to re-embrace the strategy and single out Biden again in the next debate, in Detroit. She delivered no scripted strike, and instead took a pummeling from him and others now eager to take her down a peg. “That wasn’t great,” campaign donors told her at suddenly nervy private fundraising events over the next few days. “That’s an understatement,” she responded.

Harris, however, never reversed and went after Biden. That, she told her inner circle, wasn’t her. Instead, until late this fall — just weeks before she pulled the plug on her campaign on Tuesday afternoon, after reviewing its finances and chances over the Thanksgiving weekend — Harris routinely insisted that she was still introducing herself to Americans. But Harris’s campaign, dogged for months by questions about her health-care stance, her political ideology, and, ultimately, her staff’s infighting, never seemed to settle on a single consistent answer to a question voters kept asking: What was she about? At times on the trail, she presented herself as a matter-of-fact progressive, a comforter-in-chief, and an unapologetic prosecutor. Harris, and those who’ve known her for decades, insist all of these are accurate descriptors, but that at her core she’s a results-oriented pragmatist with a long-running disdain for ideological boxes. That, they often said, is precisely what the country could have used right about now. Yet as Harris tried appealing to as broad a swath of the Democratic electorate as possible, she found that in an overflowing field led by three far better-known characters, being a consensus-style candidate who can offer something to everyone meant it was especially difficult to offer everything to anyone.

When Harris sat down over the weekend to re-evaluate her plans and dig deep into her campaign’s financial state after a pair of brutal reports from the New York Times and Washington Post, she saw an operation quickly running out of cash and low on realistic paths to victory, even though she already qualified for the December debate. She spoke with family and close aides, and considered both her short-term options and her political future beyond the primary race. On Monday, she determined there was no politically acceptable way for her sputtering campaign to keep competing. She opted for an abrupt halt to a fall that would have been unfathomable back in Oakland in January, but which could have worsened in the unforgiving Iowa winter.

It would soon get harder, but at the time, the aftermath of the Detroit debate felt like a new low for Harris’s campaign. Looking back four months later, that stretch crystalized what went wrong. As she struggled to find a meeting of minds with the voters she needed between spring and fall — while Biden held onto his support and Elizabeth Warren gained steam — Harris and her team tried out a series of different messages. They didn’t stop trying until they ultimately settled on “Justice Is on the Ballot” late this year. Some political allies urged her to return to the “fearless” message she’d used while running for Senate in 2016. (“Fearless” was also the name of a TV ad she’d ran that was based around footage of Warren praising her.) Others grumbled that her early focus on “truths” meant little to voters, and that her subsequent “3 A.M. Agenda” wasn’t ambitious enough. “Sometimes her over-preparation comes across as a lack of preparation,” said one of her advisors. Still, most in Harris’s corner were convinced that she was close to hitting the right note. “The political consultant class gnashes their teeth over this — they have to market a product,” a Harris friend and longtime political ally told me this fall. “The problem that they have is: She is what she is. She’s complicated.” After the second debate, her team advised her to start telling more personal stories on the campaign trail, fearing the career prosecutor who was campaigning on her toughness was coming across as too lawyerly.

But then, and throughout the campaign, the advice wasn’t always consistent. “I don’t know who’s in charge,” one former Harris aide who remains close with her team told me repeatedly over the summer and fall. Harris has long been surrounded by a wide array of advisors — in addition to campaign chair Maya Harris (her sister), and campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, there were strategists Sean Clegg, Ace Smith, and Laphonza Butler, former chief of staff Rohini Kosoglu, adman Jim Margolis, and pollster David Binder, among others. “It’s a Kamala thing to have 9,000 people whispering in her ears, thinking they’re running the show,” said another of her ex-aides.

For nearly a year, her allies privately downplayed the importance of Iowa’s caucuses and New Hampshire’s primary to their ultimate strategy, insisting her strength would come in the more diverse Nevada and South Carolina, and then in the big March-voting states, beginning with California. But over the fall and early winter, Harris was forced to effectively shutter her campaign outside of Iowa and, to a lesser extent, South Carolina, in a dramatic but uncertain attempt to free up whatever resources were available for a last-ditch run at those states. (“I’m fucking moving to Iowa,” she was overheard telling Senator Mazie Hirono this fall.) As she slipped into fifth place or worse in national polling, and as she fell far behind in the first-to-caucus state where she bet it all, she cut her payroll and struggled to raise money, all while fighting off a widening stream of stories about disarray among remaining aides. Staff morale plummeted, and private finger-pointing burst into public, with her campaign manager and her sister mired in the middle.

Evidence existed that Harris was connecting with the voters who were still coming to see her and her latest message while she hosted intimate meet-ups and voter dinners — she often ended events hugging and consoling crying Iowans who’d just revealed stories of runaway health-care costs or job loss or gun violence. But her crowds were frequently dwarfed by most of her front-running rivals, as once-Kamala-curious Iowans who’d first seen her lighting up Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr, and Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill gravitated elsewhere in the intervening months. And positive November developments — a well-received speech at the same closely-watched pre-caucus fundraising dinner that breathed life into Barack Obama’s campaign in 2007, an endorsement from the influential United Farm Workers union, Thanksgiving in Iowa, and a debate performance widely seen as a much-needed rebound — did little for her polling, which was stuck in mid-single digits, or her fundraising, which flatlined, then bottomed out. Where she was once a widely-liked contender frequently named as voters’ second choice candidate, her net favorability rating dropped by about 25 points in Iowa between June and November, according to in-state polling.

On a gray afternoon late this fall, Harris sat across from me on the second floor of a t-shirt shop in Cedar Rapids, her final stop on a three-day, six-town swing in the eastern part of the state, and explained that she thought voters had a hard time grasping her candidacy because they’d never seen a presidential hopeful quite like her.

Throughout her campaign, Harris, 55, projected a “Can you believe this shit?” air in public when talking about Donald Trump or the day’s latest outrage. But in person, when she was comfortable, she was more analytical. She could be startlingly jocular at times — once, in August, when we were finishing an interview on her campaign bus, rolling up to a Muscatine senior center where she’d lead the residents in a game of bingo, she exuberantly burst out singing, “B-I-N-G-O!” and exhorted her heretofore quiet aides to join in. But she was more often deliberate. Still, as her campaign matured and fumbled, she grew more open to allowing glimpses of how the Trump age and the presidential race hit her personally, which occasionally meant barely masking her frustration.

At the t-shirt shop, she raised her eyebrows and, with a little smile that then turned serious, said she’d been thinking about something, and was going to try it out on me. She was going to say a phrase, and would ask what image I pictured in response. “The boy next door,” she said, then paused. That week, all the buzz on the ground in the state had been about Pete Buttigieg. “There is an image there. And you can think about certain people on the debate stage that could be attributed to.”

“Are there four words who would describe who I am? There’s no frame of reference,” she continued. Exactly a week later she’d announce a mass staff layoff and underscore the extent of her bet on Iowa, to try and catch up to Buttigieg, but also Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Warren. “Like, we have terms for that guy. He’s the boy next door. That’s your uncle, who’s at the Thanksgiving dinner, who does this thing and that. There are images. The girl next door, there’s an image for that, too.”

“Is there enough time?” one of Harris’s longest-standing political allies asked me as early as September. “I don’t know.” A few weeks later, most of the political world had decided, basically, that there was not. That didn’t stop Harris advisors from pointing out that in late 2003 — the last time a Republican president loathed by the left was up for re-election — John Kerry still trailed Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt in Iowa, which he then won. Perhaps thinking it unwise to compare herself to Kerry, Harris never talked much about that race. But late this fall, after months of pleas from her aides to tell more personal stories, she started speaking about her own time in Iowa 12 years ago, door-knocking for another candidate who was still far behind at that point. Obama’s campaign, too, was described as listless and overmatched before its own Iowa relaunch.

Often, she’d tell the story of meeting an elderly woman at an African-American senior center in Des Moines the night before the 2008 caucuses and convincing her to turn out for Obama even after the woman told her, “They not gonna let him win.” Harris would make the case that her challenge was simply convincing voters she could beat Trump. But by that point, the comeback she’d need just to stay in the game in Iowa — a state where voters and kingmakers pride themselves on their discernment and their patience in making up their minds — was far bigger than both Obama’s and Kerry’s were. In October, I spotted former Iowa Representative Dave Nagle hanging out in the back of a Harris town hall in Waterloo. Nagle, who left Congress 26 years ago and hasn’t endorsed any 2020 candidate, praised Harris’s ambitions in the state, but was far from convinced: He said she had dropped by his office building earlier in the year for a separate meeting, but had neglected to stop by and say hello to him. “As Charlie Brown said, there’s no greater burden than great potential,” he said.

At the time, Harris’s advisors were insisting she could still win if she finished in the top three in Iowa (some privately said top two), and they hoped Trump’s impeachment would return the former prosecutor to voters’ minds. Harris herself, though, hesitated to call the inquiry good for her campaign when Nancy Pelosi first announced it. When I asked her the next day, by phone, whether her history in law enforcement might give her an opening during months of impeachment talk, she replied, “Well, I mean, I suppose there is that.” Soon, though, she became convinced she could make up ground by focusing on Trump: She took to calling him a “walking indictment in a red tie.” Later in the fall, she told me: “He literally told us who he is when he said, ‘I could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue.’ He was saying, ‘I can commit a crime,’ meaning, ‘I’m willing to think that I might, and if I do, I would get away with it.”

Still, “I understand!,” she said of voters’ hesitation while addressing a local party fundraiser in a dark DoubleTree hotel ballroom in Cedar Rapids in October. “People are saying, ‘Maybe it’s not your turn, maybe it’s not your time,’” she continued, over the clink of silverware. “But I will tell you, Linn County, I’ve heard this conversation in every campaign I have — and now here’s the operative word — won.” She was trying to convince Iowans she was still worth considering as her campaign — running perilously low on cash — scrambled to raise enough money to put a new ad on air, or even online. She repeated the line until the campaign’s final days.

The first time I heard a journalist straight-up ask Harris if she would run for president was less than two months after she joined the Senate in 2017. The first time one of her then-likely opponents described to me why she’d be a serious contender was that summer. The first time I heard someone in her orbit outline her possible path to the nomination was before the midterms. This autumn, when it was becoming clear that Harris was struggling to break through to the surprisingly solid top rank of candidates, I started hearing from a quiet cadre in her orbit that believed if she could find a way to last long enough in the race — deep into next year — she might be well positioned to compete in a contested convention next July. That view gained purchase among some of her most loyal supporters, who saw a drawn-out fight as a very long-shot best-case scenario.

But others, including many in her inner circle, wondered how much longer Harris would be willing to stay in a race where she was stuck responding to others and unable to gain attention on her own terms. One of their concerns: That Harris’s name would remain on the California ballot even if she was no longer a viable candidate by the state’s March primary, which could lead to an embarrassing result that further weakened her political standing at home. Even after what Harris’s team thought was a standout performance at November’s debate, it was Buttigieg who gained the most potential new supporters in its immediate aftermath, according to FiveThirtyEight’s overnight polling. Among some aides and allies, whispers about Harris’s future were common — whether she might have a future in someone else’s presidential cabinet; whether she might have to worry about a primary challenge to her Senate seat in 2022; or if there might be room for her to run for the presidency again in 2024 (if Trump is re-elected) or 2028. “I do think she has another shot at this,” said Randi Weingarten, the influential president of the American Federation of Teachers union, in late October.

Harris herself never talked this way, of course — until the final days, she’d pepper her speeches with “I intend to win!” — but she thought, and spoke, more about representation, and what her candidacy meant, in recent weeks. “The feeling that I have, the sense of responsibility to be on that stage, and to do well on that stage because of that responsibility — I never want to disappoint anybody,” she told me in Cedar Rapids, reflecting on her status as the most prominent black woman candidate ever, and just the second since Shirley Chisholm nearly half a century earlier, and a child of immigrants. This was a conversation she’d had with her family when she first decided to run, she said. “Because I know what being on that stage means to a lot of people, and for a lot of people. And I carry that, as something that is heavy. Meaning it is very important.”

Harris’s struggle to get the right voters to truly understand her pitch began the day after her Oakland launch. Rarely has a campaign gone from such a high to damage control so immediately. Speaking with Jake Tapper in Des Moines for a televised town hall, Harris answered a question about private health-care coverage by unspooling a long answer about insurance company bureaucracy that included the line, “Let’s eliminate all of that, let’s move on.” Harris had been the first senator to sign onto Sanders’s famous Medicare for All bill a year-and-a-half earlier, but she’d also co-sponsored a more modest scheme that would permit private insurance in some cases, so it wasn’t yet clear how she’d position herself in the race. The next day, a Harris advisor told CNN she would be open to moderate proposals allowing for some private insurance coverage, and thus began a mind-numbing saga that turned into a media proxy for Harris’s ideological flexibility and unwillingness to be pinned down on policy. In April, she told Pod Save America: “I’m not saying we need to get rid of private insurance.”

By May, she was trying to get off the health-care topic as she leaned into her prosecutorial experience on the trail as a way of contrasting directly with Trump, a pivot that inflamed internal campaign tensions — and questions about decision flow — that were never resolved. On one side was Harris’s sister Maya, her campaign chair who is especially attuned to the activist left. On the other was a set of Harris’s strategists including Clegg and Smith, who saw more opportunity in a more moderate tack. Then, in June, she raised her hand on the debate stage when asked if candidates would “abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan,” only to, afterward, say she thought the question was if she’d give up her own coverage. Finally, in July, Harris released her own plan, with a longer transition period away from private insurance than Sanders’s, but a narrative was already set about her caution and perceived flip-flops. It was en vogue then to compare her to Marco Rubio — a GOP Establishment favorite “candidate of the future,” until he wasn’t, in 2016 — or, as Nate Silver did, to Mitt Romney: “Hits all her marks, positioned quite optimally toward the middle of the primary electorate and has the potential to unite different wings — but voters aren’t entirely clear what she stands for,” he tweeted late that month.

For left-wing activists already suspicious of Harris because of her prosecutorial record, it was all further evidence that she was no true progressive. For wary moderates and conservatives, it was reason enough to think she stood for radical change. All the while, Biden’s support was holding firm and Warren’s was only growing, contrary to the long-standing projections of Harris’s inner circle. Behind the scenes, aides agreed Harris needed a serious fix, and soon, but the lack of a clear chain of command bogged down their decision-making, and territorial tensions ruled out collaboration between some of the team’s most important players.

Yet Warren’s rise through the summer was also forcing Harris into a conversation she found counterproductive, especially during her first extended tour of Iowa, in August. “No false choices” had been something of a personal slogan of hers earlier in her career, and she now saw no contradiction in saying one day that she was not trying to restructure society and another standing for the Green New Deal and eliminating the Senate filibuster to achieve it. Harris refused to pinpoint herself on the Biden-to-Sanders political spectrum, even when asked point-blank. “I think it’s just a nice subject for a graduate class, but it’s not how people are living life,” she told Bloomberg. Later that day, while meeting with farmers in Lacona, Iowa, she said, unprompted, “You don’t have the luxury of engaging in some intellectual political conversation about what we need to grow and thrive.”

“It is frustrating,” she said to me the next day on her shiny black campaign bus (with “KAMALA” written on its side in yellow, blue, and red). “And it’s frustrating because — I mean, this sounds so cliche — but it’s the labels, right? And it tends to oversimplify issues, and it tends to reward or induce a requirement to have really discrete — and not many — categories. And so, ‘Which of these few categories do you fit in?’ Those categories that have been pre-designated, by the way, by other people. And I just refuse to do that.” She leaned forward with her arms crossed, sitting across from a map of the state stuck up on the wall with pins marking her stops in the state. A handful of aides sat around, listening quietly and nodding knowingly. Some pretended not to be listening in. They’d all heard this from her before, and would again. This question “never comes up with voters,” she said. “It never comes up with voters Never! Voters don’t have time for that.”

Harris then decided to play strategist. Upon leaving the state, she called each member of her senior staff. The political territory in Iowa felt more fertile than expected, she told them, and, recalling her time campaigning for Obama in 2007, she said she saw an opportunity to compete seriously there if she could spend enough time on the ground to prove she could win. She directed Rodriguez to draw up an entirely new plan: To make sure she’d now have enough resources to compete in Iowa and increase her in-state staffing, and to fill the fall with stops in the state. In September, she announced her first surprise pivot to Iowa. Soon after, she redrew her campaign’s organization to give Kosoglu a formal role and hand Butler direct reports, aiming to establish order.

That discipline never arrived, and she also spent nearly all of late August and September off the trail, raising money — which was supposed to come easier to her given her history running high-dollar campaigns in California, but which was both an increasingly difficult task amid Buttigieg’s rise and her plateauing polls, and doubly important to fund her Iowa push. For over a month, she didn’t visit Iowa. When she started returning, her crowds were smaller, the focus elsewhere. With the media’s eyes on other candidates, Harris resumed talking about health-care — promoting her proposal’s protection of union workers’ plans, and calling it “Medicare for All.”

A few weeks later, she tried putting a more positive spin on the lingering questions about her political identity. Harris was in Los Angeles, taking a quick break from a West Coast fundraising swing, and when I asked about her struggles explaining her health-care position to a national audience, she grew reflective. “It can often just be the inability to see something they’ve never seen before, so they want to put it in a box that they have seen before. So it’s maybe an oversimplification. That’s the challenge, really,” she said, sounding far less exasperated than on the bus, slightly more at peace with this existential challenge. She was “asking people to see something they’ve never seen before. And I know it is asking a lot, and I say, based on experience: I know people are up for it.”

In September, a Los Angeles Times survey revealed that Democratic voters identified Harris as their closest ideological fit, after all. A week later, a poll conducted by Binder, working for another client, showed her slipping into sixth place in Iowa, down 13 points from mid-summer.

Since the day Harris launched her campaign in January, some Democrats in her orbit wondered aloud whether it’d be worth starting a super PAC to support her. The notion was always knocked down as other candidates rejected help from such outside groups, but the idea never quite died.

Late Tuesday morning, operatives monitoring TV ad spending noticed that a brand-new super PAC had started placing buys to run a pro-Harris spot in Iowa. It was a last-ditch, million dollar effort created by long-time aides to prop her up as her own campaign effectively ran out of cash as she criss-crossed the state. The cavalry wasn’t quite arriving to save her, but here, at least, was a much-needed last-second boost. The plan was to air a minute-long video that featured Harris grilling Barr, Kavanaugh, and Sessions, and closed by calling her “the Democrat for president that Donald Trump fears most.”

Early Tuesday afternoon, Harris got on a conference call with what remained of her campaign staff. She thanked them for their work, but told them this was the end of the road.

“I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,” she wrote in a final email to supporters. “I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do.”

Within an hour, the super PAC canceled its ad buy.

“The world is broken,” said Kerry, who was made available for the interview by Biden’s campaign. “Our politics are broken. The country faces extraordinary challenges. And I believe very deeply that Joe Biden’s character, his ability to persevere, his decency and the experiences that he brings to the table are critical to the moment. The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.”

Kerry cited Trump’s trip to the NATO summit in Britain this week. “The petulance and smallness and ridicule that he invited is very dangerous for all of us,” Kerry said. “And that just underscores the urgency of people recognizing the assets that Joe Biden brings to the table.”

He also said he felt strongly that Biden could beat Trump next November. “The president knows it,” he added. “And that’s why he was so busy dispatching Rudy Giuliani and engaging in unconstitutional behavior.”

The endorsement by the former secretary of state dovetailed with another effort by Biden to highlight disdain for Trump on the world stage, including at the just-concluded NATO meetings, where some foreign leaders were filmed mocking him.

In a lancing ad posted Wednesday night on Twitter, Biden used that video and other Trump foreign policy conflicts, juxtaposed against pictures of Biden dealing soberly with world leaders and stepping off Air Force Two as vice president.

In his narration, Biden called Trump “insincere, ill-informed, corrupt, dangerously incompetent and incapable, in my view, of world leadership.” By late Thursday, the video had been viewed almost 9 million times.

AD

Kerry’s endorsement comes at a moment when Biden has drawn criticism for a lack of consistency as a candidate. He is struggling in both Iowa and New Hampshire, where he began the campaign leading the field and has slipped significantly, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. The Iowa bus tour is part of the Biden campaign’s effort to turn around his candidacy.

AD

The announcement marks the second notable endorsement for Biden by a member of former president Barack Obama’s Cabinet. Tom Vilsack, the former agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor, and his wife, Christie, endorsed Biden late last month and have campaigned with him in Iowa.

Sixteen years ago, in late 2003, then-Sen. Kerry was in a similar situation to that of Biden today, with his presidential campaign lagging in Iowa — and struggling nationally far more than Biden’s. Kerry revived his candidacy early in 2004, winning Iowa and then New Hampshire and from there cruising to the nomination. Asked what Biden should do to get his campaign moving, Kerry said, “He needs to do exactly what he’s doing now.”

AD

He also defended Biden against criticism, saying the media has sometimes created characterizations that overstate the candidate’s problems. He pointed to Biden’s resiliency in national polling and to the breadth of Biden’s coalition and in particular his support from African Americans.

AD

Kerry conceded that Biden has sometimes appeared to struggle to find words in the candidates’ debates but dismissed it as insignificant. “Who hasn’t done that, over a lifetime?” he said. “He is just honest, straightforward. He’s a Joe that represents the middle class of America and understands them, I think, in ways that will reach way beyond Donald Trump in a general election.”

Kerry said his decision to back Biden is not meant as criticism of any of the other Democrats in the race, including two from his home state of Massachusetts — Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former governor Deval Patrick. “I like Elizabeth enormously. I worked very hard to help her win her seat. And I like Deval. I worked closely with him as governor. I just think Joe is the person for the moment,” he said.

AD

Kerry was secretary of state in 2014 when Biden’s son Hunter joined the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. At the time, Biden was the point person leading an effort, backed by U.S. allies, to fire the Ukrainian prosecutor, who was regarded as an obstacle to attacking corruption in the country. While there has been no proof of wrongdoing by the Bidens, Trump and his loyalists have seized on their actions; the president’s demand that Ukraine’s new leader investigate the Bidens has formed the nucleus of the ongoing House impeachment inquiry.

AD

Republicans have raised the prospect of calling both Bidens to appear at Senate hearings, but Kerry said he wasn’t worried about that possibility. “I’m not concerned about that, and I think there won’t be very much,” he said. “You guys will discern pretty quickly how craven and empty it is. Obviously, this could be a tough fight. But I think Joe is up to being tough.”

When Kerry was struggling in late 2003, he watched as Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont and the presidential front-runner, picked up high-profile endorsements, including from former vice president Al Gore and then-Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. Those endorsements proved of little value in the end for Dean.

“I think the value of it [the endorsement] is that it stops people, hopefully, and provides some food for thought. I have never presumed anybody can tell anybody else how to vote,” he said. “I don’t approach it that way. It’s a recommendation and a rationale. . . . People will make their own judgments.”

A central conceit of the last two Republican presidential campaigns was that President Obama had eviscerated America’s global standing. Mitt Romney cast him as inordinately apologetic. “President Obama began his [presidency] with an apology tour,” Romney claimed. “America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators.” Trump similarly claimed that Obama got duped into unfavorable deals with countries like Iran and went so far as to call him “the founder of ISIS” for his purported diplomacy failures in the Middle East. This was part of a pattern: The ex-president, Trump has claimed over the years, was a “disaster,” “weak,” “ineffective,” and “the worst president maybe in the history of our country.” “We need a President who isn’t a laughing stock to the entire World,” he tweeted in 2014.

The claim made by both men — and echoed by a range of conservative pundits — is that Obama projected weakness and therefore failed to command respect. America’s enemies and allies alike ran roughshod over him as a consequence, greatly eroding the country’s esteem on matters both military and economic while his countrymen wallowed in shame back home. This is demonstrably false: If anything, Obama improved how other nations viewed the United States, overseeing a dramatic spike in worldwide favorability that had plummeted during George W. Bush’s tenure and has fallen again under Trump. (The Obama spike was most acute in Western Europe; in Middle Eastern countries racked by his drone war and decimated by Bush-initiated military occupations, U.S. favorability has stayed underwater.)

The nagging irony is that Trump — the self-styled strongman elected to resurrect American greatness from the grave in which Obama purportedly buried it — has made a practice of getting laughed at by foreign leaders. This dynamic generated headlines during the NATO convening this week, where French president Emmanuel Macron used reverse psychology to provoke him into expressing plaudits for NATO — which the American president had previously lambasted and sought to withdraw from — then joined Prime Ministers Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom and Justin Trudeau of Canada to laugh at Trump’s knack for aimless rambling. Their mirth was preceded by that toward a speech Trump made at the United Nations in 2018, where he claimed, absurdly, that his “administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” The audience of foreign dignitaries responded by collectively bursting into laughter. Most recently, the lack of respect Trump commands on the global stage was the theme of a Joe Biden attack ad.

Unsurprising though it may be that Trump has pursued his promise to restore American esteem abroad by making a mockery of it, it’s equally unsurprising that his supporters in Congress and the electorate are mostly unbothered. (Romney, to his credit, is a rare exception.) This can be explained largely by partisanship: Trump has pursued a racist and plutocratic domestic-policy agenda that aligns firmly with much of the GOP’s own, so it’s often in their interest to continue supporting him no matter how embarrassing he is. But it’s also explicable by the manner in which he and his followers believe their power should be projected — namely, performed loudly and insistently with little regard to how its putative targets actually interpret it. What Trump thinks translates as power, after all, is apparently not the same as what Macron and Trudeau do. On the contrary, plenty who encounter this behavior find it amusing, even worthy of ridicule.

But this fails to register — or matter — to Trump and his supporters because the rest of the world and its leaders are not their intended audience. It’s a display for their own benefit, an assertion of their ability to menace those with smaller guns, less money, and less to gain cathartically from responding in kind — a way to claim a superficial brand of social dominance recognized primarily by themselves. This is not an accurate reflection of real strength, brute or otherwise. Obama’s more conciliatory approach to foreign policy neither diminished his standing with NATO nor negated the number of nuclear weapons at his disposal. It’s a difference of affect, a divergence in philosophy regarding how the American ego should be stroked. Obama’s approach, at least initially, endeared him to those critical of Bush-era jingoism. Trump’s does the same for people who think saying “sorry” makes you weak.

This difference complicates any analysis claiming that ridicule from global leaders is a crushing blow to Trump’s ego. Fragile though that may be — and while he almost certainly despises being laughed at — the respect he craves most is that of his supporters who, ironically, applaud him for the same conduct that elicits eye rolls from those whose regard he purports to be regaining. It doesn’t require a brilliant political strategist to weigh the costs and benefits of such a dynamic and conclude that it’s more important — if one wishes to win reelection — to please the people voting for you than those in other countries with whom you conduct sporadic diplomacy.

It also highlights a political advantage: The American electoral system is set up so that Trump can win reelection while earning several million fewer votes than his opponent. His primary mandate is to attract a crucial cohort of (almost exclusively white) supporters in a handful of states while ensuring that his core supporters stay motivated. It’s an indictment of American pseudo-democracy that this reelection strategy has been proved successful once before, and rests on the whims of a minority that shares his appetites rather than a majority that largely does not. Crucially, none of this translates to worldwide respect. And rather than aberrant, such behavior merely continues a long history of American arrogance on the global stage — an impulse to manipulate international affairs, often by force, to suit its own ends with minimal regard to the upheaval, impoverishment, or death it causes others. Trump’s putative mission to reestablish the country’s global standing isn’t a failure if it’s not actually the goal. Instead, it’s poised to pay dividends by a metric dearer to Trump’s heart: getting reelected in 2020."

He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump,” the report continued. “His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.”

Biden has survived and is now more critical of his rivals, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) who he claims never got the scrutiny she deserved for her Medicare-for-all plan. (He might have added that she has not gotten many queries about her subsequent retreat from Medicare-for-all, either.) He has a few things going for him now that the candidates have dwindled.

AD

AD

First, no one in Iowa can honestly doubt who he is and what he stands for. He was never for Medicare-for-all; he wants to build on the Affordable Care Act. He is not an America First or an America Retreat proponent. Reporters talk a lot about authenticity but do not seem to grasp that, for many voters, all those gaffes and strange verbal journeys show how different he is from his opponents. He does not need to introduce himself to the African American community. He is comfortable in his own skin (maybe too comfortable?), which voters can sense. Even if they don’t love him, they trust him.

Second, Biden sure has lowered expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire. That is the flip side of losing one’s lead. He does not have to win or even come in second to keep going. Staying ahead of one or more of his rivals in these first two races likely will be good enough to keep him in the race through Super Tuesday when his national name recognition and support among nonwhite voters will pay off.

Finally, as Trump destroys one government institution after another, sending career civil servants into retirement and deforming the mission of Cabinet departments (Does anyone think the Environmental Protection Agency is looking out for your health and well-being?), it might dawn on voters that the next president will find the federal government in utter disarray. It surely is the case that the next president will have to rebuild our reputation internationally.

Under such circumstances, perhaps someone who knows everyone and every nook and cranny of government and every world leader would be useful.

This is not to say that Biden is the “front-runner,” but he has as good a chance as anyone to win the nomination. He and his team have figured out that Twitter and the rest of social media, not to mention national media outlets’ snarky 30-something reporters, don’t represent America. You would be foolish to count him out.

Three of the four distinguished constitutional law professors appearing during today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing on impeachment were called by the majority Democrats, and unsurprisingly they agreed that the president’s behavior toward Ukraine, Congress, and his own Justice Department represented textbook grounds for impeachment. They expressed no real reservations about those conclusions.

Judiciary Republicans got to call one witness, and presumably they could not find a constitutional authority who shared the president’s often-repeated belief that he can do any damn thing he wants, or even one who was open to the conspiracy theories so many of them promote, or to their depiction of Trump as a brave patriot fighting corruption at home and abroad and suffering persecution for his virtue. But they found the next best thing: George Washington University’s Jonathan Turley, an outspokenly non-partisan and Trump-skeptic expert who nonetheless in every significant particular reinforced their claim that Trump’s being railroaded toward impeachment via a hasty partisan effort based on evidence falling far short of constitutional standards for removing a president.

In his opening remarks Turley made it clear he had voted against Donald Trump in 2016, and in defending him against impeachment he made a telling comparison of POTUS to Satan via a long account of St. Thomas More’s defense of giving the devil the benefit of the law from the fictional drama A Man for All Seasons. In both his prepared remarks and in answering questions he positioned himself as someone who deplored the partisan passions of the day, while sadly concluding that the impeachment effort — and the Republican battle against it — was just another example of a nation gone mad.

In other words, Turley was the perfect witness to appeal to self-styled political independents and putative 2020 swing voters who might approach this entire controversy with a plague-on-both-your-houses attitude. He wisely fell silent when Republican questioners retailed their own conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden or other nefarious Democrats.

Now if you read or listened to his words closely, it became apparent he differed from the other witnesses — and from the weight of opinion in constitutional law circles — not just on Trump’s impeachment but on all sort of fundamental issues. Unlike the others, he thinks presidents cannot obstruct Congress — or even obstruct justice — unless they defy judicial orders (unfortunately, federal judges typically refuse to police executive-legislative disputes, particularly those involving impeachment, as “political questions”). Unlike the others, he believes the constitutional standards for “bribery” track later criminal statutory definitions. And unlike the others, he would limit impeachments to situations where such criminal statutes are violated.

He also made it reasonably clear that he felt Bill Clinton was properly impeached, and that Andrew Johnson was “railroaded” much like Trump; Nixon, he feels, deserved impeachment but not on the obstruction of justice grounds that might provide a precedent for impeaching Trump. And above all, he stressed that legitimate and politically-sustainable impeachments require a lot of time (“saturation and maturation,” as he put it). As of this writing, he hasn’t addressed the question of how an alleged effort to rig an impending election can be addressed at the requisite leisurely pace, but Turley is clearly on board with the bedrock GOP argument that this impeachment proceeding is by definition illegitimate because it is happening so quickly.

So he is in an excellent position to give “non-partisan” credibility to the intensely partisan — by his own accounting — Republicans he is materially assisting. He reminds me a lot of David Brooks and other center-right pundits who profess disdain for partisans — equal disdain, regardless of the facts in any particular case — but who happen more often than not to come down on the side of whatever the GOP wants at any given moment.

Anyone seduced by Turley’s reasonable manner and apparent passion for fairness should reflect on the fact that he considers Andrew Johnson — the autocratic racist who tried to reverse the gains in human rights secured by the bloody sacrifices of the Civil War — a great victim of congressional abuse of power, and an appropriate role model for Trump as the object of an illegitimate impeachment inquiry. In his comparison of the 17th and 45th presidents he finally makes a point with which we can all agree.

And it’s not necessarily the CrowdStrike theory that has the strongest connection.

Between Oct. 24 and Nov. 4, we fielded an online survey of 1,206 American adults. The survey respondents were provided by Lucid and were weighted to approximate a nationally representative sample.

AD

AD

At the beginning of the survey, we posed the following question on impeachment:

Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have recently launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump. This is because he allegedly withheld American military aid to Ukraine to pressure its president to provide negative information about Joe Biden, a Democratic rival. What do you think of this?

The largest group (35 percent) said there is enough evidence to merit impeachment. An additional 14 percent agreed there is enough evidence for further inquiry. By contrast, 16 percent of Americans said Trump acted improperly but is not impeachable. Twenty-four percent said Trump did nothing wrong. Eleven percent said they didn’t know what to believe.

As other surveys have found, opinions are polarized along party lines. Sixty-nine percent of Democrats support outright impeachment, while only 5 percent of Republicans do. Meanwhile, 57 percent of Republicans think Trump did nothing wrong, compared with 2 percent of Democrats. Independents are more evenly divided, with 45 percent supporting impeachment or further inquiry, 41 percent preferring censure or exoneration, and 14 percent having no opinion.

But beyond partisanship, a second factor is related to impeachment opinions: support for conspiracy theories about the 2016 election.

AD

AD

In the same survey, we also asked two questions that posed a choice between a popular conspiracy theory, the official explanation, or neither option. The first question regarded Russian meddling in 2016:

Donald Trump won the 2016 election despite nearly all experts and polls predicting he would lose. This was because: 1) he was able to eke out narrow wins in states that Obama won like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; 2) the Russian government hacked into voting systems and rigged the election; 3) neither

Here, a majority pick the official explanation (56 percent), while 29 percent endorsed the conspiracy theory and 15 percent chose neither.

The second was a version of the “CrowdStrike” conspiracy theory that Trump himself asked the Ukrainians to investigate:

During the 2016 election, the story that Russia planted misleading Facebook ads and hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s emails was: 1) a fact established by the FBI and other federal intelligence agencies; 2) a story planted by CrowdStrike, a security company that was hiding Ukrainian efforts to aid the Clinton campaign; 3) neither

Most respondents (63 percent) chose the first option, while 26 percent endorsed the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory.

Impeachment views are strongly related to beliefs in these conspiracy theories. Among the 29 percent of Americans who believe Russia rigged the 2016 election, a whopping 80 percent believe Trump should be impeached and 11 percent think he should be investigated further. Almost no one in this group thinks Trump did nothing wrong.

AD

AD

By contrast, among the 26 percent of Americans who believe the “CrowdStrike” conspiracy theory, nearly 50 percent think Trump did nothing wrong and an additional 25 percent believe he was wrong but that the act was not an impeachable one.

Obviously, these results are influenced partly by partisanship: 52 percent of Democrats believe in the Russia conspiracy theory, compared with only 4 percent of Republicans; meanwhile, 51 percent of Republicans believe in the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory, compared with only 9 percent of Democrats.

But even if we take partisanship into account, people who believe in these conspiracy theories still have distinctive views of impeachment. For example, among Democrats who believe in the Russia conspiracy theory, 87 percent support outright impeachment; among Democrats who don’t believe, only 49 percent support impeachment.

For Republicans who believe in CrowdStrike, 67 percent think Trump did nothing wrong compared to 51 percent of Republicans who don’t believe in CrowdStrike.

Why are these conspiracy theories related to people’s views of impeachment? In our past research, we argue that conspiracy theories tap into another force that organizes American politics: people’s intuitions. Conspiracy theories are popular because they draw on the innate ways we make judgments and rationalize our biases.

AD

AD

For people who find Trump an unacceptable president, the Russian hacking conspiracy offers a compelling way to justify their feelings. Conversely, for Americans who see Trump as their champion, the CrowdStrike conspiracy is a bulwark against inconvenient evidence of Russian influence on Trump’s behavior.

This provides another reason the impeachment hearings have had little impact on public opinion about impeachment or Trump himself. Most Americans have an ample supply of intuitions and gut feelings that only buttress how they already feel about Trump. New evidence about Trump’s behavior, or misbehavior, is unlikely to have much sway.

The latest nefarious doings of none other than William P. Barr and Rudolph W. Giuliani have now forcefully underscored this very point. In so doing, Trump’s attorney general and his personal lawyer — whose roles Trump views as one and the same — have helpfully strengthened the case against Trump.

AD

Two new investigative reports demonstrate that Barr and Giuliani are, in effect, continuing to carry out elements of the very same corrupt scheme for which Trump is currently getting impeached. Their activities have been described as “brazen,” but the truth is worse: They demonstrate with great clarity that Trump’s efforts to corrupt our political system will continue — a reminder of why he’s being impeached in the first place.

Barr hits a snag

The Post reports that Barr has hit a major snag in his efforts to validate Trump’s claim that the investigation into Russian sabotage of the 2016 election was a hoax. Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general, privately asked Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, who’s executing Barr’s review of the origins of that investigation, to validate a key element of Trumpworld’s “theory” of those origins — and he did not.

AD

AD

This is terribly inconvenient for Barr — and Trump and his propagandists. They hope such a review will allow them to cast the whole Russia investigation — and its findings of Russian sabotage and extensive efforts by Trump to coordinate with and benefit from it — as illegitimate.

Central to this is the idea that the Maltese professor who first told a Trump adviser about dirt gathered by Russia on Hillary Clinton — which launched the original FBI probe — was a U.S. agent setting up the Trump campaign. Horowitz, who is also examining the probe’s origins, has reportedly determined that he was not, and asked Durham — and intelligence agencies — to produce evidence to the contrary. They couldn’t.

It’s true that Horowitz will also reportedly announce serious irregularities with the FBI’s original handling of the investigation, and Trump’s propagandists will hype this to the skies. But the bottom line is Horowitz is expected to conclude that the investigation’s basis was legitimate, and while we don’t know what Durham will conclude, it seems clear he’s finding little to validate Trumpworld’s wild theories.

AD

AD

The key point here is that Barr, who is gearing up to cast doubt on Horowitz’s conclusions, is continuing to use the levers of government to carry out Trump’s overall corrupt project — which Trump is actively cheering on. Barr is trying to undercut the legitimacy of the Russia investigation’s conclusions — which would help make Russia’s criminal attack on our political system and Trump’s nefarious reaping of its gains disappear.

That’s exactly what Trump tried to extort Ukraine into helping him do, by announcing an “investigation” into the lie that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered, thus validating that lie — part of the corrupt plot for which he’s being impeached.

Giuliani’s latest moves

Giuliani is doing the same as we speak. The New York Times reports that Giuliani has traveled to Budapest and Kyiv, where he’s meeting with shadowy Ukrainian figures to keep building the case that Joe Biden and his son Hunter acted corruptly in Ukraine.

AD

AD

This line of nonsense has been thoroughly debunked, but Giuliani met with one of its key proponents, and is participating in the filming of a fake “documentary” that’s designed to make that narrative seem true.

In other words, Giuliani — who was the ringleader of the scheme to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that would also make that narrative seem true — has continued to try to achieve the same goals that drove the corrupt plot for which Trump is being impeached.

This, in and of itself, does not necessarily add to the case for impeachment. But, tellingly, when the Times pressed Giuliani to say whether he kept Trump informed of these latest moves, he refused to answer, even though he had previously kept Trump regularly apprised. That means it’s possible Trump has blessed Giuliani’s continued efforts to smear Biden with lies, though without the direct extortion element.

Trump’s intent is corrupt

All of this reinforces the corrupt intent that Trump has exhibited throughout. Republicans still laughably claim Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky only because he cared about “corruption” in Ukraine. But this shows again that Trump’s primary concern has been to achieve announcements of investigations into only the things that would help him politically.

In his July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Trump directed him to talk to Barr and Giuliani, who would, Trump hoped, act as his henchmen in helping Zelensky carry out those investigations. The two have simply continued to carry out this very same effort on Trump’s behalf.

AD

Even as Trump is getting impeached for using the power of his office to falsify the story of his corruption of our last election and to corrupt the next one, he’s still trying to accomplish both goals. And in Barr’s case, he’s cheerfully continuing to rely on the manipulation of the levers of government to do so.

That would be a terrible outcome. Among other things, it would prevent Democrats from employing the powerful case we just heard against Trump from constitutional scholars to Democrats’ maximal advantage.

In recent days, it has become clear that the debate among Democrats over what the articles will contain might already be too limited.

AD

Judging by what I’ve heard from Democrats, which dovetails with many news accounts, it appears the basic contours of the argument are over whether to include just two articles mainly focused on the Ukraine scandal, or to add a third that brings in obstruction of justice.

AD

The first two are likely to prompt consensus among Democrats. The first would charge that Trump abused his power by using the weight of his office to corruptly extort Ukraine into announcing investigations that were solely designed to satisfy his various political needs — validating lies absolving Russia of 2016 electoral sabotage and smearing potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.

That would likely include the conditioning of official acts — a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid — to pressure Ukraine, and the enlistment of multiple Cabinet officials and top White House advisers in the scheme.

AD

The second article would charge that Trump obstructed Congress’s efforts to learn the truth through maximal resistance to any and all subpoenas, and through blocking testimony from numerous figures who had first hand knowledge, among other things, of Trump’s decision to freeze the military aid to extort Ukraine.

AD

Some Democrats, however, want a third article included, which would also charge Trump with obstruction of justice, based in part on the special counsel report, which documented numerous episodes of such obstruction, some of which were shockingly lawless.

But some moderates in difficult districts appear to oppose including this third article. As Politico reports, those moderates see peril in including anything from the special counsel report, because it smacks of relitigating 2016.

AD

As one Democrat from a GOP-leaning district put it, “Activities from the 2016 election, I think, should be left to voters in the 2020 election.”

This would be a terrible mistake. It would squander an important advantage Democrats have right now.

One of the most powerful aspects of the case Democrats have built is that Trump is serially corrupt. He has abused his power again and again and again. He has repeatedly dangled official acts to solicit more foreign interference in the election after working extensively to coordinate with and benefit from the same last time around.

AD

Trump enlisted large swaths of the government in carrying out this scheme (the State Department, budget officials) and in covering it up (his Justice Department tried to bury the whistleblower complaint, and numerous Cabinet officials are refusing to testify and turn over documents).

AD

The obstruction of justice documented by the special counsel isn’t floating out in some other separate galaxy called “2016.” It is part of the same story we’re seeing right now and that will continue going forward, potentially through 2020 and beyond. In that story, Trump has worked to corrupt both elections on his own behalf and has corruptly tried to cover all of it up.

By rubbing our faces in his corruption, by defiantly asserting there was nothing wrong with his pressure on Ukraine, by blithely calling on Ukraine — and China — to investigate Biden after his scheme had been unmasked, Trump has flagrantly signaled he will continue using the levers of government to corrupt the next election.

AD

This pattern is powerful. The extensive obstruction of justice to obscure outside sabotage of 2016 runs right into his current obstruction of the investigation into his corrupt efforts to solicit outside interference in the next election. All together, it tells a story of shocking betrayal of the country.

AD

Those constitutional scholars demonstrated powerfully that this pattern of abuses is what signals that Trump represents a continuing threat to our free and fair elections, and that this requires the remedy of impeachment.

“The President has engaged in a pattern of abusing the trust placed in him by the American people by soliciting foreign countries — including China, Russia, and Ukraine — to investigate his political opponents and interfere on his behalf in elections,” testified Professor Michael Gerhardt.

AD

Arguably, establishing this pattern would be even more forceful if it included Trump’s abuses of his office to line his pockets — his nonstop profiteering off the presidency.

AD

But for now, let’s just note that failing to include obstruction of justice would paradoxically weaken the case Democrats are making on the Ukraine scandal itself. Moderates hopefully will see that this would also weaken the case they will have to make — both substantively and politically — to their voters as well.

Pelosi did not detail a specific timeline or how expansive the articles of impeachment would be. House Democrats have considered charges that include obstruction and bribery, according to congressional aides, as they continue to debate internally over widening the articles to cover Trump’s conduct outlined in then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation as evidence that the president has repeatedly obstructed justice and solicited or welcomed foreign interference in his election bids.

The aides cautioned that the situation remains fluid. But Democratic leaders believe they have overwhelming support for articles dealing with the core of Trump’s conduct regarding Ukraine, according to two leadership aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. Lawyers from the House Intelligence Committee, which drafted a 300-page report detailing Trump’s alleged misconduct, will present the official findings in another highly anticipated hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday.

Leading Democrats, including Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), have already identified as bribery and an abuse of office that rises to the “high crimes and misdemeanors” standard Trump’s effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch political investigations advantageous to Trump.

AD

AD

Democrats allege Trump withheld a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine in the face of Russian military aggression, to force Zelensky to order official inquiries into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

There is no appetite for trying to impeach Trump on grounds of treason, the third specific act listed in the Constitution’s definition of impeachable offenses, according to people familiar with the plans.

While Pelosi’s announcement was expected for weeks, it still marked a moment in American history. Only two of the previous 43 presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was convicted by the Senate and removed from office. Trump is likely to meet a similar fate, but the Senate trial would nonetheless occur less than a year before Election Day and will add another level of partisan animosity to a campaign that already promises to be full of rancor.

AD

Trump on Thursday dared Democrats to act quickly, turning his focus to the Senate, where the White House has already previewed an aggressive defense strategy that could entail calling witnesses to the chamber floor.

“They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy,” Trump tweeted. “Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business.”

Trump demanded to call as witnesses an array of Republican targets, including Pelosi, Schiff and the Bidens. Republicans have also floated summoning the whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine triggered the impeachment inquiry.

AD

Later at the White House, Trump dismissed any notion he is concerned that impeachment would tarnish his legacy.

AD

“It’s a hoax. It’s a hoax. It’s a big, fat hoax,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters that came during a meeting with U.N. representatives.

The entire GOP apparatus mounted a fierce defense of Trump as soon as Pelosi announced House Democrats’ next steps Thursday morning, with both Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, warning of political repercussions for Democrats in next November’s elections.

“Working Americans and their families are not well-served by Democrats’ political performance art. What they really need, what they really need, are results,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in response to Pelosi’s announcement. “The only path to results is bipartisan legislation.”

AD

AD

Pelosi, who confirmed shortly after her impeachment announcement that the House will vote next week on a bill to lower prescription drug prices, played down any potential political retribution for Democrats at the polls.

“This has absolutely nothing to do with politics,” she said.

House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) also suggested Thursday that Democrats would be free to vote as they choose on articles of impeachment without pressure from party leadership, saying in a statement that “this is not an issue that we are going to whip.”

But tensions over the impeachment inquiry and the contentious clash between the parties burst further into public view on Thursday when a reporter pressed Pelosi on whether she hates Trump — an accusation leveled by Republicans against the speaker and other Democrats.

AD

AD

“This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the president’s violation of his oath of office. And as a Catholic, I resent your using the word ‘hate’ in a sentence that addresses me. I don’t hate anyone,” an agitated Pelosi responded to the reporter, James Rosen of the Sinclair Broadcast Group. “And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.”

Trump, clearly following the day’s news developments, responded shortly after on Twitter, taunting Pelosi for what he called a “nervous fit.”

“She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more,” the president tweeted. “Stock Market and employment records. She says she ‘prays for the President.’ I don’t believe her, not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?”

AD

AD

The tensions also spilled onto the Democratic presidential campaign trail, when Joe Biden — campaigning in New Hampton, Iowa — engaged in an extraordinary exchange with an Iowa voter who pressed him on his son’s activities in Ukraine.

The younger Biden sat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, whose owner had come under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. As vice president at the time, Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden. But the Iowa farmer who challenged the former vice president accused him of “selling access” through Hunter Biden’s seat on Burisma’s board, even though there is no evidence Joe Biden played any role in getting him the job.

AD

AD

“We all know Trump has been messing around in the Ukraine over there, holding their foreign aid . . . saying they’re going to investigate you,” said the man, who declined to identify himself. “But you, on the other hand, sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company — that he had no experience with gas or nothing — to get access to the president. You’re selling access to the president, just like he was.”

Biden quickly responded.

“You’re a damn liar, man. That’s not true. And no one has ever said that,” he responded.

In an interview with Telemundo, Biden acknowledged that his son’s board posts “may have looked bad but wasn’t anything wrong” and contrasted it with Trump’s efforts to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

“Can you imagine that?” Biden said in the interview. “It’s like sayin’ to a governor in a state, ‘You have a tragedy; unless you agree to support me next time I run, I’m not gonna bring any — I’m not gonna allow any federal aid to come to help your citizens.’ Come on.”

Hunter Biden’s position on the Burisma board has become a major point of scrutiny for Republicans, who have been seeking to turn the tables against Democrats on impeachment, particularly once the fight shifts to the Senate. To that end, Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani met Thursday in Ukraine with one of the key figures working to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden.

The lawmaker, Andriy Derkach, posted on Facebook photographs of himself meeting Giuliani in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, vowing to set up an anti-corruption group in the Ukrainian parliament. Giuliani’s presence in Ukraine advances efforts by Trump allies to create an alternative narrative in the rapidly moving impeachment investigation.



But top Republicans have declined to answer why the GOP did not investigate the Bidens over the issue when they held both congressional majorities in 2017 and 2018 if they are so concerned about it now.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) repeatedly dismissed the fact that information about the Bidens’ actions regarding Ukraine was public knowledge well before 2019, including in several news accounts.

“Did you know any of the information?” he said in response to a question from a reporter after his weekly news conference."

In a Fact Checker column on Wednesday, The Post’s Glenn Kessler sought explanations from reps for Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) for assertions the lawmakers had made about certain events in Ukraine bearing on the ongoing impeachment proceedings. Graham’s office referred him to a relevant news account, though Kessler determined that it didn’t quite corroborate a Nov. 21 letter that Graham had sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

So Kessler renewed his efforts, pressing Nunes’s office on the matter, as well. An hour or two later, he got a call — from Solomon. ""Out of the blue we received a phone call from John Solomon, a former Washington Post reporter who apparently was the source for Republicans. He said two people from Capitol Hill had alerted him to our inquiry,” writes Kessler.

AD

AD

Which is to say, Solomon is now doing press for Republicans.

The Kessler fact-check is heavy on minutiae relating to a period in late 2015 and early 2016 when then-Vice President Joe Biden was pressuring Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to crack down on corruption, including a famous demand to fire Viktor Shokin, who was Ukraine’s prosecutor general at the time. A false narrative — in part enabled by Solomon’s reporting for the Hill — maintains that Biden lobbied for Shokin’s sacking to ease pressure on a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, that was paying the vice president’s son Hunter up to $50,000 a month to serve on its board. As Kessler points out, the truth lies in the opposite direction: Biden, his colleagues in the Obama administration and Western allies wanted Shokin out because he was weak on corruption.

The episode illustrates the overlap between Solomon’s reporting and Republican talking points. Graham’s letter to Pompeo asks for documents that might shed light on “allegations that Vice President Biden played a role in the termination of Prosecutor General Shokin in an effort to end the investigation of the company employing his son.” The request is premised upon these considerations, per Graham’s letter:

Compare that with Solomon’s timeline:

Notice the overlaps? Asked about the Solomon situation, Senate Judiciary Committee spokeswoman Taylor Reidy responded in an email that Graham is continuing to investigate what Hunter Biden “was doing on the board of a Ukrainian gas company,” considering his lack of experience in the energy sector. “As we investigate these troubling issues we will continue to follow and consult with a number of sources both inside and outside the government, including John Solomon’s reporting. We welcome others, including the media, to join in investigating these issues as well. For the most part, many media outlets have chosen to simply scoff at the troubling, unanswered questions of Ukraine corruption.”

AD

AD

We’ve also sought comment from Solomon and from Nunes’s office. We’ll update this post if we get a response.

Kessler awarded Four Pinocchios to both Graham and Nunes for their assertions about Biden’s phone calls and how they allegedly coincided with raids on the home of Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky in February 2016. In reality, notes Kessler, “nothing significant” happened in this time period, “except primarily the reinstatement of a previous court order.”

The episode shows the continued demand for Solomon’s work, even after his departure from the Hill and a career steeped in flimsy, debunked and tendentious stories. There’s demand on the Internet, there’s demand on Fox News and there’s demand among powerful GOP lawmakers. That’s all good news for Solomon’s next step: a media start-up that might just have some eager funders.

“What would you have done to me? Torn my ears off. Absolutely. I’d be a plagiarizing, no-good old man,” Biden told reporters, seeming to allude, in one sentence, to the plagiarism scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential bid and the nagging questions this time about his age.

The “No Malarkey” tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.

AD

AD

“I’m going to say something that I believe to be self-serving, and maybe it is,” Biden told voters in Emmetsburg, Iowa, on Monday. “In all those states we have to win, I do pretty well. . . . So, folks, I believe I can beat Donald Trump. I believe we will beat Donald Trump. I believe Donald Trump believes I will beat Donald Trump.”

Venting his anger

But the tour has also at times served as a bit of a release valve for weeks of seemingly pent-up frustration.

After stumbling in 1988, Biden endured another failed White House bid 20 years later when his 2008 candidacy was overshadowed by the electrifying primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And now Biden has been unable to put away opponents with shorter résumés and, in his view, a lesser chance of defeating Trump.

AD

On Monday, as Biden’s caravan traveled from a stop in northern Iowa to the airport, where he was jetting off for an evening of fundraising in New York before resuming the tour, he invited a group of reporters onto the bus for an unusually expansive conversation. At times, the exchange felt more like an airing of grievances, with Biden waving off staff members who noted he was going over the 30-minute agreed-upon time limit.

AD

“Look at the polling everywhere,” he said in response to a question about Warren. “Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself. She lives in Massachusetts. She’s advertising millions and millions in New Hampshire. Why shouldn’t she be known there?”

When it was pointed out that thousands of Warren supporters had come to see the senator recently in Chicago, he became incredulous.

AD

“Chicago. Oh, great, a great showing in Chicago. Look, guys, you always want to give me numbers but never want to apply numbers to them.”

He said the media’s bias toward Warren was evident as she shifted her stance on Medicare-for-all. Warren had embraced the single-payer plan trumpeted by Sanders. But last month, she pivoted to a more centrist idea: delaying the implementation of Medicare-for-all by three years. In the interim, health-care consumers could opt in to a government plan. But Biden said the media didn’t fully interrogate Warren about how much her initial Medicare-for-all plan would cost.

AD

“How many times did the press ask how much it will cost,” Biden said. “She never answered, because you kept talking about how she’s rising.”

AD

The electability argument

Biden said he felt he’d been fighting against another hurdle: the perception that he was too moderate for a Democratic Party that had become more liberal following Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016.

“What happened after Hillary. [People said,] ‘Guess what, man, the party has turned so far left. So far left, man. And you just can’t win, no one can possibly win, not in that lane.’ Now, and I was the one, remember all the debates in the beginning, ‘Biden is the moderate. Biden’s not progressive enough.’ ”

But now, he noted, other candidates have embraced a more moderate view on health care — adopting what he called the “Biden plan,” preserving the Affordable Care Act and giving the public an option to join a government program.

AD

AD

“I said it then, I’ll say it again, Medicare-for-all ain’t going anywhere, period, because there’s a thing called truth in getting there,” Biden said.

The “No Malarkey” theme, emblazoned in big white letters spread across Biden’s blue motor coach, comes from one of Biden’s favorite expressions. It’s another way of saying “straight talk,” which became the calling card for similar bus caravans that helped define the political brand of a longtime Biden friend, the late Republican Sen. John McCain.

The tour is an attempt to form connections with a larger swath of Iowans, particularly in rural areas, Biden said. It stretches through eight days and more than 660 miles.

AD

At times early on, Biden sounded hoarse or dabbed at his nose during a taxing long weekend of town halls and small-town pit stops. Staffers kept a glass of water tucked near any lectern where he was speaking. His speeches were short by Biden standards, around 20 minutes or so per stop, a move he said gave him ample time to talk with anyone who stayed after but also offered some respite for his vocal cords.

AD

Biden and his surrogates — he spent the first part of the tour traveling with former U.S. agriculture secretary and Iowa governor Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie — have argued that Biden is beating Trump head-to-head in battleground states that could decide the election. Iowa Democrats, they said, should consider those numbers when deciding which potential nominee could attract general election voters in key states.

“What about the people who aren’t as involved in politics? What about the independents? Who are they going to trust as well?” Christie Vilsack asked voters in Spencer on Sunday night. “The election is going to be won in the middle. And I want to make sure that I choose the person who’s most electable to the widest group of people.”

Some voters who came to see Biden along the tour acknowledged a concern that a more liberal nominee seemed like a risky bet in the general election.

“I hear a lot of people saying we need to take this . . . swat to the left, and I just don’t agree with that,” said Travis Halm, 29, of Council Bluffs, who came out to see the kickoff to Biden’s bus tour. “We can have a contest about who’s more liberal or who’s more progressive if we want, but it’s not going to do us any good if we’re sitting around sulking on November 4 after losing an election.”

Bob Seggerman, a registered Republican who voted for Trump and plans to do so again in 2020, got talked into coming to an event at a church-turned-restaurant in Spencer by some of his friends who are Democrats.

“I think [Biden has] got a softer appeal that’s more empathetic, and I like him more than the other Democrats,” he said. But, added Seggerman, who at 67 is a decade younger than Biden: “The only thing is, I look at the age of this man. A person who gets to be a certain age is ready to do just about anything but be president.”

AD

On the stump, Biden told voters that Trump’s America had failed middle-class and rural communities like the ones he was visiting on his bus tour. There were also lighter moments, like the widely mocked and memed image of Biden nibbling on his wife’s finger during her opening speech. Mostly, though, he stressed that he would bring a steady hand to the nation’s highest office and foreign policy, and that he’d put middle-class values first.

“I think we have to very deeply restore the backbone of this country, and by that I mean the middle class,” he said.

The tour underscored how Iowa remains vital to Biden’s hopes of winning the nomination. He has vowed to visit all 99 counties during the campaign, though even after the barnstorming trip, he will only have been to about a third. A weak showing in the Feb. 3 caucuses could affect his strength in two other early voting states — South Carolina, where he holds a big lead among that state’s large African American electorate, and Nevada, where he says he has strong Hispanic backing. If he survives there, another threat looms in early March, when the race turns to multiple big states in a Super Tuesday showdown where former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to make his stand.

'Still well in the game'

Biden, in his session with reporters, offered his analysis of the road ahead — all but conceding a potential Iowa defeat but insisting that he alone can rebuild the multiethnic coalition that propelled Obama.

“If I were to come in like some of the polling has shown, you know, like, five points behind, three points behind or seven points behind, I think I survive.” he said. “I think I do well, because of the depth of the support that I have in the African American [and] Latino community, and there’s not anybody so far that has risen to the point where they can all of a sudden everybody in the community can say, ‘Whoa. Wait a minute.’ Well, there is nobody else that’s in there that’s in a position to do what Barack was able to do."

Three of them (Biden, Warren, Sanders) are in their 70s, two are women and three are moderates (Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar).

Granted, it is a strange lineup for a party that is so dependent on nonwhite voters and, as the media keep telling us, has been trending far-left. The ascendancy of moderates is also reflected in Warren’s decline when she embraced the progressives’ Medicare-for-all plan. Sanders has a constituency that is loyal, limited and non-transferable. In short, right now we do not see enough staunch progressive voters to produce a plurality for any candidate. (The Warren-Sanders vote in national and early state polling cumulatively remains under 40 percent, although just barely in Nevada.) After all the hoopla about the party’s shift to the left, the three moderates might have the inside track for the nomination.

Despite an uneven performance and disproportionately negative coverage, Biden has kept a loyal base of supporters, including a significant plurality of African American voters, who have not been tempted to shift en masse to another candidate. If Biden can survive the first two primaries with comparatively few nonwhite voters, he will have a sizable advantage as states with higher percentages of nonwhite voters weigh in. The other candidates’ hopes rest with Biden’s unraveling in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden’s worst-case scenario would be a poor finish in both and a single opponent sweeping both.

Buttigieg’s path is straightforward: a top finish in Iowa and/or New Hampshire, the departure of one or more lagging candidates and then a one-on-one match-up against either a super-progressive or Biden. If it is the latter, however, African American voters might deprive him of the nomination.

Then there is Klobuchar, the emerging dark horse, if only because she has survived and gained stature by making it to the debate stage with better-known candidates. She successfully developed a solid ground game in Iowa and a feisty persona with a moderate message. She has to perform, as they say, “better than expected,"" in Iowa, which amounts to beating one or more of the top four contenders (Biden, Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg) and then slugging it out state by state. Her best hope comes in a race in which she becomes the last moderate standing.

It is worth noting that voters supporting a candidate who fails to get 15 percent in the first round in the Iowa caucuses are freed up to choose another candidate. The Iowa winner might turn out to be the second choice of the fifth-place candidate. (Yes, this is a heck of a way to pick a nominee.)

None of this means that Warren or Sanders, who have come down in the polls from their spring and summer highs, are out of it. However, as we know, once candidates’ poll numbers have dropped substantially (e.g., former congressman Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Kamala D. Harris), it is hard to get voters to reconsider them.

Between now and Feb. 3, when the voting starts in Iowa, a candidate can get hot, or stumble; an unexpected event (such as an impeachment trial) might throw a monkey wrench into the race. Anyone tempted to predict the outcome should consider just how many bits of conventional wisdom have evaporated upon contact with real voters. In other words, nobody will know much of anything until the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire speak.

But the group isn’t completely adrift. “We said if somehow this one doesn’t work out we’ll go with that one,” said Scott, who said they’ve been closely monitoring two other candidates. “We go deep into planning.”

Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next.

The California senator left the race after support and fundraising slumped — but after nearly 11 months she had amassed a well-regarded bounty of supporters, particularly among black Democrats.

AD

The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters.

AD

At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women.

The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.

AD

“I don’t know who needs to hear this but stay the [expletive] away from the Harris field,” wrote Dvorsky on Twitter. “Of course you want them to work for you. They’re freaking amazing. And sad. And grieving. Sit all the way down. They know where you live. They’ll get back to. Or not.”

A spokesman for Harris didn’t reply to questions about whether she would endorse another candidate in the race.

AD

By 9 a.m. Wednesday, less than a day after Harris’s surprise departure became public, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign announced he had won the endorsement of Mitch Henry, a key Iowa figure who had been a member of Harris’s Iowa Latinx steering committee.

In the hours after Harris left the race, everyone from her finance team, to a local South Carolina gun control activist to members of Congress who had sided with her were hearing pitches.

AD

Four campaigns — and one presidential candidate — reached out to Iowa state Rep. Ross Wilburn of Ames within 24 hours of Harris leaving the race.

“It was just offers of support, one or two with more of a pointed ‘here’s what my candidate brings to the table,’ ” Wilburn said, adding that he received a call from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and campaign officials representing former vice president Joe Biden, former Maryland congressman John Delaney, and Sens. Warren and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

AD

Other Harris supporters also were girding for a full-court press from candidates, with Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, warning the white candidates not to “pander.”

AD

“What have you done in the past that will give me an indication of what you will do in the future for people of color?” Fudge asked, explaining what she wants to hear. “A lot of people have great plans. But if you put a plan together without the input of the very people you say you want to help, that is just as pandering to me as anything else.”

“We like Warren. We like Sanders. We like Biden. We like our neighbor in South Bend,” said another caucus member, Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.), referring to Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of the Indiana city. “We’re just deciding which one we like the most at the moment.”

AD

During her campaign, Harris didn’t fit neatly into a particular ideological lane, meaning that there was no single obvious beneficiary of her departure.

AD

In South Carolina, some observers assume much of Harris’s support could go to Biden, who already is well known among African Americans there.

But Warren also is positioned to benefit, said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a group trying to elevate women of color in American politics.

“She’s been focusing on intersectional policies that directly address race and gender,” Allison said. “Warren and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders are beneficiaries of the latest dynamic.”

Many of Harris’s donors were already looking elsewhere. Roughly half of more than 100 well-connected fundraisers who raised at least $25,000 for Harris’s campaign also gave the maximum donation to some of her Democratic rivals, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.

AD

AD

Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic donor, jumped on board with Harris shortly after her campaign launched in Oakland in January. But later, Buell also supported Buttigieg.

When asked about Harris’s campaign shortly before she dropped out of the race, Buell said in a text message: “Sad that Kamala didn’t do better but she wasn’t ready.”

Buell added on Wednesday that she is now fully backing Buttigieg: “I am seeing his effective, creative campaign as a symbol of his leadership qualities. The energy and focus in the campaign is very positive and impressive.”

The ultimate fight will be for the individual voters who backed Harris, including people like Vanessa Phelan, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mother of two from Des Moines.

AD

Not long after Harris dropped out, texts started to come in from organizers of other campaigns. “It was, like, ‘Not today Satan,’ ” she said.

AD

Phelan said she will eventually settle on another candidate but isn’t sure when. The hardest part of Harris’s decision to quit, she said, was explaining it to her 4-year-old daughter Zoe.

“Kamala ran out of money,” Phelan told her.

The little girl looked at her mother with wide eyes, trying to understand. “I’ll give Kamala my piggy bank,” her mother recalled Zoe saying. “I want her to be president.”

One might reasonably ask why a political action committee trying to help a trailing candidate is going after the guy who’s currently in fourth place in national polls. Whatever the strategic calculation, there are a lot of people in the Democratic Party who resent Buttigieg’s (still modest) success and would like to see him taken down a peg or two.

AD

AD

Do they have a point?

The simplest answer is: Sure. Buttigieg is 37 years old. He’s the mayor of a city of approximately 100,000 people, which makes it the 306th largest city in the United States. On the most basic level, it’s ridiculous to think you could go from that job right to being president.

Booker isn’t the only one who has found Buttigieg’s success exasperating. Last month, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) argued that a female candidate of Buttigieg’s age and résumé would never be taken seriously. “Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,” she said of herself and the other female candidates. “Maybe we’re held to a different standard.”

AD

It’s difficult to argue with Klobuchar. In fact, it’s difficult to imagine a 37-year-old female mayor of a mid-size city even considering a run for governor, let alone president. Buttigieg has benefited from a particular kind of bias shared by the media and many voters: When we think “president,” we imagine a white guy, and so even an extremely young white guy seems plausible enough to take seriously.

AD

In all likelihood, Buttigieg decided to run for president because there were no more proximate rungs on his ladder. He can’t run for Congress because his district is heavily Republican. (In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by 23 points). Becoming governor of Indiana is similarly unlikely. And, these days, even an unsuccessful run for president can give your career a boost; heck, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson wound up with a Cabinet position in an area he had never spent even a moment contemplating.

And Buttigieg is unquestionably talented. He may not be Barack Obama, but he’s smart, articulate and personable. If you like former vice president Joe Biden’s ideological and political approach, but would prefer someone less than half his age, Buttigieg is your guy.

AD

Experience isn’t everything, of course; there have been good and bad presidents who brought experience to the job. But being a successful president does require a unique combination of knowledge, character, vision and temperament. They have to wrangle Congress to pass a legislative agenda, manage the world’s largest organization with more than 4 million employees and a budget of more than $4 trillion, navigate complex relationships with other countries, and deal with natural and human-caused crises.

AD

If nothing else, it’s easier for voters to determine whether someone can do all those things when they can look at what that person did in jobs of increasing responsibility that dealt with the types of domestic and foreign issues a president is responsible for. Since there’s no other job quite like that of president, voters will always be guessing at how a person might perform, but at least the candidate’s history can provide some clues. With Buttigieg, there really isn’t that much to go on.

It’s not all that surprising that Buttigieg would be the target of ire (spoken or otherwise) from some of his opponents. Every candidate who isn’t winning will inevitably believe there’s something unjust at work in a race that isn’t rewarding them for the fact that, in their own minds, they’re the obvious choice. To run for president, you need an enormous ego and tons of self-confidence, so all of them probably feel that if voters would just listen, they’d be in the lead — or at the very least where Buttigieg is, not leading but in a position to get there.

AD

But Buttigieg is particularly likely to frustrate other candidates. If you’re behind Biden you can say, okay, that makes some sense: He’s been around forever, he was vice president, he’s obviously qualified. You might look at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and say, I get it, he’s got a base of support on the left that won’t desert him no matter what. But a pipsqueak like Buttigieg? What’s he got that I haven’t got?

AD

In the end, the answer may be: Not enough, at least not this time around (after all, he could run 10 more times before he’s too old). But if he keeps gaining strength, other candidates both above and below will be only too eager to try to take him out.

We need to be much clearer on why Trump himself is doing these things — that is, on his true purpose in employing these lies to serve his own corrupt interests.

AD

And we need to grapple with the implications of this alliance with what you might call “Putinism” in a way that doesn’t treat it as a fleetingly useful political tactic, but rather as something with serious real-world consequences.

AD

The problem with the ‘dupe’ formulation

The occasion for this reevaluation is the devastating new House Intelligence Committee report detailing Trump’s extortion plot toward Ukraine and the Judiciary Committee’s consideration this week of whether Trump committed impeachable offenses.

On one level, the problem with the “Trump as Russian dupe” formulation is that it implicitly but dramatically downplays the severity of Trump’s corruption and the threat it poses to the country.

AD

The new House report vividly dramatizes why Trump undertook his corrupt plot to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do his political bidding and what that says about Trump’s intentions toward our government and democracy going forward.

For Trump, the utility of getting Zelensky to announce an investigation validating the lie that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in 2016 wasn’t simply that it would salve his bruised ego over his need for Russian help to win.

AD

This false narrative would also help Trump confuse the U.S. electorate with disinformation obscuring his own corrupt efforts to coordinate with and benefit from that sabotage of our political system. This in turn could facilitate benefiting from the next round of such sabotage, which he has openly invited.

AD

In short, the report demonstrates that Trump’s profiting off Russian sabotage last time, and his efforts to extort Ukraine into helping him again, are the same story — one that will continue.

Trump was emboldened by getting away with the first installment, and when the second installment was unmasked, Trump blithely said in reporters’ faces that Ukraine — and China — absolutely should launch an investigation of potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden, his other extortive demand.

On top of this, the report demonstrates how numerous cabinet officials and extensive government resources — and the conditioning of multiple official acts — were placed at the disposal of the whole corrupt scheme.

AD

AD

Taken together, the report concludes, this “presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office” to corrupt the next election on his own behalf, and that in so doing, Trump recognizes no legitimate “limitation.""

We now know that the lie about Ukrainian interference has been a mainstay of self-absolving Russian propaganda for years. But Trump hasn’t been duped into spreading it. He explicitly recognizes an alliance of his own interests with those of Russia in doing so (and in procuring whatever other outside help he can) in corrupting U.S. liberal democracy for his own malevolent self-interested purposes.

This has implications for impeachment. As Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman will argue to the Judiciary Committee, impeachment binds the president to the rule of law, as a remedy against abuses of power to advance nakedly corrupt self interest.

AD

AD

Which leads to the bigger point.

This has broader consequences

The Post reports that much of the GOP has now adopted the false narrative about Ukraine, in league with Trump. But many quoted ask too narrow a question: Whether this means the GOP is dropping its previously “hawkish” posture toward Russia.

It’s worth asking whether something more consequential is happening.

A broader approach was suggested to me by foreign policy scholar David Rothkopf, who argues that we should think about “Putinism” as a “worldwide movement” that allies various ethno-nationalist and illiberal authoritarian leaders against Western liberal democracy, the rule of law, international institutions and the commitment to empiricism in the face of disinformation.

AD

“Trump, his administration and the GOP have made a conscious choice to align themselves with Putinism,” Rothkopf told me. “It is not unwitting.”

AD

It’s not easy to say how committed Trump is to these tendencies. He yearns to operate more fully as other illiberal authoritarians do. But for all his bluster about our current alliances, it’s unclear how much damage he will do to them in the long run.

Still, it’s obvious that Trump — and, increasingly, many of his GOP defenders — are to some untold degree operating in sync with Putinism and are acting against the interests of our liberal democracy.

This also has ramifications for Democrats. The Post piece reports that some strategists “see a possible opening” for the eventual nominee to win over “hawkish Republicans and independents who are wary of the Republican drift on Russia.”

AD

But Democrats need to go bigger. As Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg suggested to me, party leaders must argue that the GOP’s “embrace of the Ukraine fiction” is not merely a matter of domestic political expediency. Rather, it’s time to ask whether we’re seeing the beginnings of a “realignment” with this global right wing movement against the values and even the interests of “the United States and the West.”

AD

“Democrats must step up here and explain to the country the gravity of the moment,” Rosenberg says.

Trump’s degradations have forced us to grapple with the correct language to describe the moment in all kinds of ways. It’s time to do away with the “dupe” formulation as well.

ALLENDALE, S, C. — The Democrats in South Carolina's bluest county had laid out the welcome mat for Pete Buttigieg: a crowded headquarters, a soul food buffet, and praise for being the first 2020 Democrat to visit.

The next thing the South Bend, Ind., mayor got was skepticism.

“I hear a lot about how you don't have support from African Americans,” said Willa Jennings, the county Democratic chair. She turned to Sharon McBride, a black member of South Bend's city council who'd come to campaign with Buttigieg. “Could you tell us some of the things that Mayor Pete has done in South Bend to benefit the citizens in your city?”

It wasn't comfortable. It wasn't supposed to be. Buttigieg, who has surged in polls of Iowa and New Hampshire thanks to support from college-educated white voters, had put together a sort of Southern humility tour. A candidate breaking crowd-count records in small, white towns was holding small meet-and-greets in nonwhite ones.

“I know a lot of African American voters have felt not only kicked around by the Republican Party, but sometimes taken for granted by the Democratic Party that knows how to come to church just before an election but doesn't always come back and engage the community when it's most needed,” he explained. “I know that as somebody who's new on the scene, I've got to earn that trust.”

Sometimes he linked his life as a gay man and son of an immigrant to the experience of nonwhite voters. Sometimes, more self-effacingly, he admitted what he didn't know. In Allendale, where McBride called it a “myth” that Buttigieg had problems with black voters back home, Buttigieg said he was working to connect his own experience to theirs, if he only got the time.

“It's so important to me to earn the support of black voters,” Buttigieg said. “Now, if you were the last poll that came out, I think there were two candidates who had double-digit support among black voters. All the rest of us were in [single digits]. But I don't think that's permanent.”

That was a reference to a national Quinnipiac poll, which had shown Buttigieg surging to 23 percent with white voters, a lead, while winning just 4 percent of black voters. No other candidate polling in double digits overall had such a large racial support gap. His weakness with nonwhite voters has become a punchline from “Saturday Night Live” (“My supporters are a diverse coalition from young to old, gay to straight, white to eggshell”) to the Onion (“Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote”). And racial justice activists had piled on, with a protest breaking out at a pro-Buttigieg event in South Bend, and four immigrant rights groups demanding that he give back any donations from McKinsey employees after revelations about the consulting firm's work on deportation.

Buttigieg's monochrome appeal has made the campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden (the two candidates with double-digit support from black voters in that Quinnipiac poll) happier about his rise in Iowa. In their view, the mayor could kneecap Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has made some inroads with black and Latino voters and take over her “lane” with well-educated white voters, only to get pushed out in Nevada and South Carolina. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, one of the state's most prominent black politicians — the kind of pol, an ambitious mayor of a mid-sized city, who has gotten behind the mayor in other states — endorsed Mike Bloomberg days before Buttigieg's latest trip began. Even this week, as Buttigieg went on the air with a $2 million ad buy, supporters of Biden and Sanders dismissed his chances.

“He's a nonstarter; he's not going to scratch,” said Dick Harpootlian, a state senator and Biden supporter. “This is a guy who's been the mayor of a town not even as big as Columbia, who's got tremendous issues with race relations, who's abandoned his city to run for president. He's not got any sort of civil rights record that would engage African American voters. He's too young and too white.”

The mayor's low-key Southern tour put all of his troubles on display, as well as the different ways he has tried to tackle them — sometimes admitting his blind spots, sometimes sounding too eager to link his relatively privileged life to black and brown struggles.

On Sunday, after attending a service at the Rev. William Barber's church in North Carolina, Buttigieg admitted that he “worked for years under the illusion that our schools in my city were integrated because they had to be, because of a court order.” On Tuesday, at a roundtable with Latino voters, he mentioned that his own father came to America in the 1970s under the “lawful immigration process.” But the experience of a first-generation Maltese American didn't really resonate in the room.

“Part of the bigger issue that is affecting our communities is really that fear in trusting someone again, right?” said Fernando Soto, a DACA recipient and immigrant rights activist from Charleston. (He'd attended a previous meet-and-greet with Biden.) “The Latino community is very, very loyal. But we've been burned many times. And with the Obama administration, I would say that we were tokenized in order for that election to be won.”

Soto wanted Buttigieg to promise an immigration solution in his first term, which Buttigieg did before returning to his overall theory of politics. “If this White House really wanted to resolve immigration issues, they could do it; there's a bipartisan consensus, and then they could claim credit for the achievement,” Buttigieg said. “But they've made a decision not to. And I think that shows that the division is more useful to them than the issue. For my White House, the reverse would be true. We are depending on a more unified country.”

Without Biden's long record in the state, or Sanders's civil rights history, or Warren's detailed critique of discrimination, Buttigieg was often asking voters to see his sincerity. In Allendale and at the Latino forum in Okatie, voters most impressed by Buttigieg cited his military service as evidence that he understood nonwhite voters.

“When you sign up you meet people from all kinds of different backgrounds,” said Gustavo Gomez, 47, a Marine veteran, who’d asked Buttigieg about Puerto Rican representation in Congress. (Buttigieg favored changing that “sooner rather than later,” which Gomez appreciated.) “That helps you govern better.”

On Monday afternoon, Buttigieg took a tour of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, solemnly visiting a memorial to students killed in 1968 when protesting a segregated bowling alley, then bowling a round at the alley on campus — eight pins, then a strike. Two dozen students stopped by for free pizza and conversations, appreciating that Buttigieg would spend the time with them.

“He just did an endorsement video for my Instagram,” said Kayla Hasty, 21, who was running in a contest to pick the top 10 “kings and queens” of historically black colleges and universities. “You don't see many politicians doing that.” She remained undecided.

Charles C. Patton, Hasty's running mate, was in some ways less impressed. Buttigieg was not connecting with black voters, he said, when he linked his own life to the civil rights struggle. As a queer man, Patton found Buttigieg most compelling when he talked about LGBTQ rights, a subject he clearly knew inside out.

“I was happy to hear that he knows what's going on in our community, with black trans women, with LGBTQ youth, with homelessness,” said Patton. “That mattered to me. I like him. He's cool. I love his policies, but sometimes people don't have real awareness of how it affects people, and he has that.”

It was as strong a connection as Buttigieg had all day. After their conversation, Patton was considering a vote for Buttigieg — or Biden, or Warren.

DEBATE SEASON

There are just seven days left for Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to make the sixth Democratic debate. It’s not likely to happen.

To climb onto the Los Angeles debate stage, Booker would need to hit 4 percent in four polls, or 6 percent in two polls of the early-voting states. There may not be enough polls in the field right now, even if Booker were experiencing a dramatic surge in support. Which he isn’t.

That was the backdrop for Booker's Thursday morning speech in Iowa, a late edition to his schedule in the wake of Sen. Kamala D. Harris's exit from the presidential race, where he argued outright that nervous donors and shortsighted debate rules were bleaching the primary before voters got to pick their candidate.

“People in Iowa, people in New Hampshire, people in Nevada, people in South Carolina should determine this race. Not how much [money] is being poured in,” Booker said. “This isn't about an individual candidate, as much as I am hurt, my family members hurt, as much as people are frustrated about Kamala’s story. Kamala was never in it for herself. She knew this was a bigger story. This is not about one candidate. It is about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump.”

Booker returned again and again to Harris, whose campaign had collapsed in Iowa, but who had been drawing bigger crowds, more endorsements, and more volunteers than the wealthy candidates who'd plunged into the race.

“She had this campaign that spoke to the aspirations of our country,” Booker said. “Here is a black woman, an Asian woman who broke barriers at every point of her campaign, and won in our largest state: 40-plus million people. She's lived her whole life dedicated to public service. I get to sit with her in the Judiciary Committee, I see who she is and I just want to say from my heart, it is a problem when an immensely qualified, widely supported, truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party, a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters, didn't have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa.”

It was a dramatic moment for Booker, who had been making this case again and again in the hours since Harris's campaign ended. Harris had qualified for the December debate, making her an inconvenient martyr for this cause. But her exit gave new urgency to an argument former HUD secretary Julián Castro had been making when he missed the November debate: The party was silencing several credible nonwhite candidates.

That argument has helped Castro, who has no path back to the stage under current rules, raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, keeping his low-overhead campaign afloat. It has found a guilty conscience in Tom Steyer, the billionaire whose omnipresent TV ads have helped him qualify for the debates.

“I’m calling on the DNC to open up the debate requirements for January so that more candidates can participate,” Steyer said in a statement. “In order to defeat Donald Trump, Democrats need to engage voters from every part of the country, and that means making sure voters hear from a diverse group of candidates before they select our nominee.”

Steyer was pushing on an open door; DNC Chairman Tom Perez told The Post last month that the DNC would revisit its debate rules in January. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said that the party had created “the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires,” and that Democrats were “proud of this historic and diverse field,” as showcased in most of the debates so far.

“While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process,” Hinojosa said. “Nobody who has failed to reach 4 percent at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that. In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We’ve never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Joe Biden, “Laughed At.” A pool camera covering a Buckingham Palace reception for NATO members captured Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau making fun of President Trump. Within 24 hours, Biden's campaign put it into an ad that focuses on the theme of his recent campaign spots: that Trump is embarrassing the country and the former vice president could restore its image. Three of Biden's last four commercials hit the same notes (and even the same imagery, of Biden walking alongside Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel), but this one went viral quickly, helped by audio clips of TV hosts discussing how little respect Trump commanded.

Elizabeth Warren, “Wealth Tax.” The senator from Massachusetts has spent less on TV than anyone else polling in double digits, and her campaign plunked down less than $1,000 to run this spot, in conjunction with her Bloomberg TV interview. It's her second time with this gimmick; previously, she bought time on CNBC to highlight criticism of the wealth tax from some of the network's wealthy guests.

Tom Steyer, “Save the World, Do It Together.” The billionaire candidate's march through early-state TV screens continues with a first: a subtle argument with another candidate. In the spot, Steyer asks a rhetorical question: “How are we going to pull this country together?” He answers it by talking about climate change. “We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world and do it together. You think that’d pull America together? I do.” It's a response to the message that has done well for Buttigieg recently, that the post-Trump president's first job will be reuniting Americans, something he doesn't tie to a particular issue.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (UC Berkeley, 1,694 California voters)

Bernie Sanders: 24% ( 5)

Elizabeth Warren: 22% (-7)

Joe Biden: 14% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg: 12% ( 6)

Kamala Harris: 7% (-1)

Andrew Yang: 3% ( 1)

Amy Klobuchar: 3% ( 1)

Mike Bloomberg: 2% ( 2)

This may be the final poll to offer Kamala Harris's name for voters, and a sub-question found that 61 percent of California Democrats thought she should leave the race. It's also Sanders's first good poll in the state for some time, though Harris's departure ameliorates the bad news for Warren: She was the most popular second choice for voters who had been sticking with the race's second-highest-profile female candidate. And she's in a better position than Biden, who trails Sanders with Latino voters and gets pummeled with young voters: By a landslide, voters under 30 stick with Sanders. Biden's strength with nonwhite Democrats, the basis of his lead in Southern primaries, is harder to find in delegate-rich California.

IN THE STATES

Florida. Andrew Gillum, last year's unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor, will become the chairman of iVote's board, following a year of voting rights advocacy and voter registration campaigns in his home state.

Georgia. Five-term Rep. Tom Graves will retire next year, a surprise for Republicans who saw a long future for their 49-year-old colleague. Graves's 14th District, which covered northwest Georgia, is safely Republican and backed the president by 53 points in 2016.

Washington. Four-term Rep. Denny Heck is leaving his relatively safe Democratic seat around Tacoma, explaining in a letter that the Republican response to the Trump presidency had wearied him: “Will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.” Trump lost Heck's 10th Congressional District by 13 points, making it a reach for Republicans in a state Democrats expect to easily win.

2020

Joe Biden. He got one of the biggest endorsements in the Democratic Party on Thursday, with former secretary of state and 2004 presidential nominee John Kerry getting behind his campaign. Kerry, who's three years younger than Biden, had been fitfully discussed as a 2020 candidate but made no moves toward a run. He'll campaign with the former vice president this weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Pete Buttigieg. He won endorsements from three lower-profile members of the Obama team: the president's personal aide Reggie Love, former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Austan Goolsbee, and former White House Office of Health Reform communications director Linda Douglass.

Bernie Sanders. He picked up the support of the Iowa CCI Action Fund, a liberal group in the state that had supported him in 2016 and worked with him in his campaigns.

Mike Bloomberg. In Aurora, Colo., the site of a 2013 mass shooting, he proposed a new gun control system that would include not just background checks but federal licensing, a bugaboo of gun rights activists.

Cory Booker. United We Win, the new super PAC that had bought an ad contrasting Booker with Buttigieg, announced $500,000 in new spending designed to help him enter the December debate. One example: a bus ad showing Booker next to Bloomberg and Steyer, with the legend, “We need diversity, not more billionaires.”

MEET A PAC

THE PAC: 1820 PAC

PARTY: Republican

FOCUS: Providing air cover for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, running ads that pitch her as a moderate who the Senate could not afford to lose.

BUDGET: It has paid for $400,000 of ads so far, and as of summer, it had raised $776,000 from wealthy donors, most of it from Blackstone Group chief executive Stephen Schwartzman.

PLAN: The group's first ad emphasizes ways in which Collins has broke with Republicans and the Trump administration. “When the big drug companies were gouging patients, Susan took them on and wrote a law to lower drug prices,” a narrator says. “When extremists in both parties shut down the government, Susan Collins led the bipartisan effort to end the stalemate.”

EFFECTIVENESS: It's on brand for Collins, whose campaign, like others that have expected super PACs to help them, had already uploaded b-roll footage for curious ad-makers. (Campaigns cannot coordinate with super PACs, but nothing prevents them releasing a few soundless clips of candidates meeting voters in factories.)

WHAT I'M WATCHING

NARAL's big 2020 bet. The abortion rights group is planning its biggest-ever political investment next year, spending $34.7 million to turn out 3.6 million voters in eight states: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina.

“We think abortion is central to the election, and it should be central,” said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. “It’s an issue Democrats can and do win on. The energy of the base on this is off the charts, because of the abortion bans we’ve seen in the states.”

NARAL's target states include a few of the Democrats' must-wins in the electoral college and a few the group sees as crucial for Senate math: Georgia and Iowa. (There are Senate races in all eight states, and Michigan and Minnesota have Democratic incumbents.)

The focus of the campaign, a combination of ads and organizing, will be “reminding people of what their senator has done and what Trump has led,” said Hogue. That included the “extraordinary overreach of judges,” the appointment of antiabortion judges who most of the targeted senators voted for (Collins was an occasional exception), and the passage or introduction of “dangerous medically inaccurate legislation” in the states.

That messaging, Hogue said, would activate three kinds of voters: the Democrats' base, lower-propensity voters who lean toward Democrats (and sat out some recent elections), and “soft partisan” women who've voted Republican before but bolted the party over abortion rights. Virginia, where Republicans tried and failed to turn legislation to loosen abortion restrictions into an election issue this year, was the proof of concept.

Hogue, who helped amend the Democrats' 2016 platform to make it more supportive of abortion rights, said that NARAL had advantages that didn't exist then.

“We were warning people that Trump said women should be punished for abortion, and that he’d appoint only pro-life judges,” Hogue said. “But there was a combination of people saying, 'Oh, he only says that to be elected,' and 'Oh, and that could never happen here.' That’s what’s been so shocking with these state laws, and that's why they're central to the campaign.”

Federal regulators are requiring Oregon to ensure its child welfare workers don’t discriminate against parents with disabilities, after the state lost its bid to take away the children of a low-IQ couple in a high-profile court battle.

This morning, the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services will announce an agreement with Oregon for the state to develop a system for ensuring its employees comply with federal law banning discrimination based on someone’s disability, whether it's physical or intellectual. Over the next two years, the state must set up training programs, provide OCR with written reports and review 10 specific cases to determine whether it acted appropriately, among other steps.

“We do commend Oregon for doing the right thing of looking hard at their policies and doing what they can to put safeguards in place so nobody falls through the cracks and ends up losing custody of their children,” OCR Director Roger Severino told The Health 202 in an interview yesterday.

Severino said the investigation into Oregon was prompted by the case of Amy Fabbrini and Eric Ziegler — a couple with below-average scores on an IQ test who lost custody shortly after both their children were born.

The couple’s IQ scores were low enough for them to have borderline mental disabilities — Fabbrini’s score was 72, while Ziegler’s was 66 — but both had graduated from high school and had taken parenting, nutrition and CPR classes to try to show their ability to care for their boys.

Yet the children were put in foster care over concerns the parents weren’t able to create a safe environment and were only returned after courts ordered it, when the boys were 4 years old and 10 months old. Deschutes County Judge Bethany Flint ruled in January 2018 that there wasn’t enough evidence to show Fabbrini and Ziegler couldn’t safely parent.

“The default presumption should be children stay with their parents and a person having an intellectual disability should not automatically change that presumption,” Severino told me.

Inside Edition did a story on the family:

Severino said his office reviewed Oregon’s compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws and found “systemic” issues with how the state follows federal law to prevent discrimination against parents with disabilities in Oregon’s child welfare system.

But OCR hasn’t reached an official conclusion on whether the state violated the laws. That’s because Oregon has agreed to undergo a self-examination process — a common way for entities to avoid being slapped with a finding of violation and potential loss of federal dollars.

""The Oregon Department of Human Services believes that all children and their families should be safe, healthy, and treated with equity and respect,” Fariborz Pakseresht, director of the state's Department of Human Services, said in a statement. “We appreciate...the assistance of the Office of Civil Rights in helping identify areas for practice improvements to ensure that all families receive the supports and services that meet their individual needs.""

Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

Oregon previously said its workers didn’t remove Fabbrini and Ziegler’s children from them solely based on their IQ scores — although the couple insisted that was the primary reason.

But requiring parents to take IQ tests as even a partial determination of whether they should be allowed to keep their kids is controversial among some advocates, who say it’s an unfair way of determining who is fit to parent.

“IQs test for problem-solving and short-term memory, basically which all goes out the window when a parent is under stress,” said Sherrene Hagenbach, who advocated on behalf of Fabbrini and Ziegler amid their court battle.

Hagenbach, who said she is also working with a deaf couple and an autistic father whose children were taken from them in Oregon, is the person who first alerted OCR to Fabbrini and Ziegler’s story back in fall 2018 and asked the department to investigate.

She’s glad to see the state launching a review but questions how much it will fix what she views as a systemic problem that is nationwide.

“I’m super excited to know they are able to review that case because it’s horrific on all levels,” she said. “I’m not sure this is gonna fix anything, but at least it’s a step in the right direction.”

AHH, OOF and OUCH

AHH: The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted 18 to 5 to approve the nomination of Texas radiation oncologist Stephen Hahn to be the new Food and Drug Administration commissioner -- but the panel's leading Democrat voted against him, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.

“Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said before the vote that Hahn is ‘exactly the type of nominee’ that should lead the FDA, citing his management and research experience,” she writes. “But Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the panel’s ranking Democrat, voted against Hahn, saying during his confirmation hearing last month he had ‘refused to commit to implementing a strong policy to clear nontobacco e-cigarettes’ from the market — a step President Trump promised in September but has not finalized. Other Democrats split, with some voting for Hahn’s confirmation and others voting against him.”

Dozens of medical, patient and research groups this week pushed to quickly confirm Hahn, even as other groups, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said he shouldn’t be confirmed to the post until the Trump moves forward on its vaping policy.

OOF: The Trump administration released details of a new program to provide free HIV prevention medication to uninsured individuals. The program — called “Ready, Set, PrEP” — will provide drugs from drugmaker Gilead Sciences to reduce the number of HIV infections a year in the country by 90 percent by 2030.

The government also reported yesterday that just 40 percent of adults in the United States have ever been tested for HIV, and fewer than a fifth of people at high risk of developing the infection get the preventive medication, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.

“Dramatic improvement of testing and prevention, as well as better treatment of people who already have HIV, are urgently needed if the government is to reach President Trump’s goal of virtually wiping out transmission of the infection by 2030, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said,” he writes. “The announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar expands government efforts to provide the highly effective medication to more people at risk of contracting HIV, including African American and Latino men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, people with mental illness and the homeless.”

Azar said about 200,000 uninsured individuals could get the free drug once they’ve tested negative for HIV and get a prescription. Three major pharmacy chains — CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Rite Aid — will be part of the program and will distribute the medication starting in March.

OUCH: Pete Buttigieg responded to the remarks from Democratic rival Joe Biden that the South Bend, Ind., mayor “stole” the former vice president’s health-care plan.

“Well, first of all, I’ve been talking about ‘Medicare for all who want it’ since at least February, and also the plans are not exactly the same,” Buttigieg said in an interview with CNN. “… Of course, I believe that our approach on health care is the best one, and I’m willing to bring that plan out and compete with any of my competitors on having the best plan.”

Biden said on the campaign trail this week that Buttigieg “doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderate — moderate plan. It’s the Biden plan.” “The former vice president then accused the media of going too easy on Buttigieg, saying his opponent had once supported a more liberal health care plan but then pivoted,” Politico’s Natasha Korecki reported. “Biden contended that if he had supported a different plan ‘and then I came along with the exact same plan, what would you have done to me? You would have torn my ears off. Absolutely, I would be a plagiarizing, no good, old man who did bum bum bum.’ ”

HEALTH ON THE HILL

— The House Oversight subcommittee on economic and consumer policy will hold a hearing today to examine the federal response to the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use.

The hearing follows recent reports that the Trump administration appears to be reversing course on a pledged ban on most flavored e-cigarettes.

“In a recent meeting with health groups, vaping advocates and tobacco executives at the White House, Trump expressed concern that a flavor ban could result in an increase in counterfeit products,” Laurie reports. “In a letter Monday, 28 members of Congress asked Trump to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market until they are cleared by the FDA. Vaping advocates have argued that a flavor ban would hurt adults using e-cigarettes to quit smoking and that youth use should be reduced in other ways, such as by restricting where the products are sold.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). (Ron Harris/AP)

— Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are calling on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Federal Trade Commission and five major health-care companies to provide information about how they are addressing bias in algorithms used in their systems.

A study published in the journal Science in October found a widely used algorithm meant to predict patient needs underestimated the health needs of the sickest black patients, as our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reported then.

“In using algorithms, organizations often attempt to remove human flaws and biases from the process,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and top executives of UnitedHealth Group, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, Humana and Aetna. “Unfortunately, both the people who design these complex systems, and the massive sets of data that are used, have many historical and human biases built in. Without very careful consideration, the algorithms they subsequently create can further perpetuate those very biases. Health care systems are not immune to the problem of bias.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)

— A little-known group, the Pharmaceutical Industry-Labor Management Association, is working to oppose drug-pricing proposals across the country, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) bill to address drug costs.

The coalition includes major pharmaceutical companies and construction industry unions whose members build pharmaceutical plants and research facilities, the New York Times’s Katie Thomas reports. The group has put its money in ads on Facebook, print ads in local publications and mailers out to voters in Democratic districts to defeat such proposals on the state and federal levels.

Their message “aligns closely with the talking points of drug companies, which claim that Ms. Pelosi’s bill would stifle innovation and damage a vital American industry,” Katie writes. “Even in the nation’s capital, where coalitions and dark-money groups are routinely used to repackage corporate interests in a more sympathetic light, the pairing of the drug industry and unions is an unusual one. Many unions, including some who are members of Pilma, help oversee their workers’ health plans and have an interest in lowering drug costs. And out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs are a financial strain on many Americans, including union members.”

She’s a relatively fresh face (in contrast to Biden), has experience in national security (sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee) and superior media skills. Moreover, she was friends with Biden’s deceased son Beau, a fellow state attorney general. One cannot help but think picking her as a running mate would strike a deep emotional cord with Biden.

Harris is one of those potential VP contenders who would help virtually any candidate — and not simply because the serious contenders who remain are all white and she is an African American woman. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could use someone older, with inside-the-Beltway experience and a record on civil rights that would reassure many nonwhite voters. If she is on the ticket with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), she provides some appeal for progressives; on a ticket with the super-progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), she becomes the more moderate vice president, someone with appeal outside the niche of white, New England progressives.

In one sense, Harris’s perceived fuzziness on issues during her own campaign becomes a plus as a vice president who can easily adopt the positions of the top of the ticket. Her own policy positions are not set in stone and are therefore not likely to clash with a running mate.

Sure, Harris’s campaign failed, but few would argue that she lacked political skills, charisma, smarts and media prowess. As a vice presidential nominee, she would not be running the campaign; she would be on one that successfully navigated through a crowded field.

There is one more interesting scenario in which she may play a significant role. This cycle really is the one in which there is a reasonable chance no candidate will get a majority in the primaries, setting up a convention fight. Who wouldn’t want to have on his or her side someone part of the largest delegation (California), someone who racked up endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus and someone who can deliver a boffo political speech in a big arena?

There will be plenty of other VP contenders, including the rest of the nonwinning presidential candidates, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, both New Hampshire female U.S. senators (Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan) and female governors Gretchen Whitmer (Mich.), Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.) and Laura Kelly (Kan.), all three of whom were elected in 2018. Nevertheless, if you want to start handicapping the vice presidential pick, Harris probably should be at the top of the list.

What happens next: Those articles will be voted on, one by one, by the House Judiciary Committee and then the full House.

There's little chance that impeachment will remove President Trump from office. But one Wall Street strategist notes that it could complicate his reelection path.

Economic forecasters have predicted that Trump should cruise to a second term next year given the strength of the economy. But a new analysis from JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that the onslaught of coverage of impeachment and Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals is drowning out the positive economic news he needs to win.

The dynamic highlights the challenge facing the White House as it pursues a split-screen strategy depicting Trump as focused on his agenda while congressional Democrats press ahead with impeachment.

Michael Cembalest, JPMorgan Asset Management's chairman of market and investment strategy, lays out the quandary facing Trump in a pair of charts. First, Cembalest crunched a raft of data to conclude Trump is heading into the 2020 campaign with the strongest economic tail winds going back to 1896.

The measures blended more than a century of readings on consumer price inflation, the jobless rate, the change in that rate, per capita economic growth, how that growth compares to that of other leading economies, stock market returns, and home price appreciation, among others:

But viewers tuning into primetime CNN and MSNBC from 8 to 10 p.m. over a year-long period ending in September saw barely a blip about positive economic developments. Instead, the Mueller investigation and Russian interference in the 2016 election overwhelmingly dominated those airwaves, followed by coverage of Trump’s personal conduct in office, then immigration issues, then administration corruption:

Trump critics will contend the president has earned that coverage through his behavior, while he merely inherited an economic expansion that has mostly continued apace. Cembalest mostly agrees: “Trump deserves the coverage he’s getting from those news outlets,” he tells me.

But he wrote the note to illustrate something he observed in his own home: His wife, a devoted MSNBC watcher, hears a version of the news that bears little resemblance to what he sees all day studying market and economic indicators. The divide both fuels and is fueled by a broader Balkanization of the electorate that suggests the traditional relationship between the economy's performance and the president’s political fortunes may be breaking down.

By matching historical economic data to presidential election outcomes, economists at Moody’s Analytics, Oxford Economics and Trend Macrolytics have all projected Trump will secure reelection more easily than his first win, barring a serious economic downturn. But the more relevant point of comparison may be 2018. An analysis Cembalest conducted after the election found that measured against the strength of the economy, Republicans suffered the worst midterm losses by a president’s party in at least a century.

The finding could reframe Trump’s political incentives in waging his trade war. Conventional wisdom has held the president keeps up the fight at his own peril, since it remains arguably the greatest menace to continued economic growth.

But if he can galvanize his base by stoking confrontation with the Chinese — and that outweighs whatever economic costs it brings — it may be in Trump’s interest to keep putting off a deal. “I think that’s true up to a point,” Cembalest says, arguing if the president goes forward with December 15 tariffs heavily targeting consumer goods, ""I think he’d lose them, because the global recession that could result would offset the benefits from the base. He has to figure out how to conduct the trade war” with lower stakes.

Some support for the theory comes from across the Atlantic. “Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, both of Bocconi University in Milan, study election results in 15 European countries,” per The Economist. “They find that areas facing greater competition from Chinese imports were more likely to vote for nationalist parties.”

More from that piece, titled ""Does the economy affect elections anymore?"": “The old straightforward relationship between the economic cycle and elections could yet return. But the implication of the new research is that support for populism is a deeper-rooted feature of Western economies… Voters care less than they used to about the economy's immediate impact on their wallets. But they care more than ever about how the economy shapes their identity--their sense of security, and their freedom.”

MARKET MOVERS

— Growth stumbles for services sector, private payrolls. Reuters's Lucia Mutikani: ""U.S. services sector activity slowed in November as lingering concerns about trade tensions and worker shortages pushed production to its lowest level in a decade, which could heighten fears about the economy’s health. Other data on Wednesday showed private employers hired the fewest workers in six months in November. The reports came on the heels of data on Monday showing manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November and a decline in construction spending in October.

""The continued manufacturing slump and second straight monthly drop in construction outlays tempered growth expectations for the fourth quarter, which had been boosted by a rush of upbeat reports on the trade deficit, housing and business investment. Still, the economy appears to be growing at a moderate pace rather than stalling.""

— Stocks snap losing streak. MarketWatch's Andrea Riquier: ""U.S. stocks closed higher for the first time in four sessions following a report that a phase-one trade U.S.-China trade deal was still in the works, helping to offset fears of a delay sparked a day earlier by [Trump’s] remarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 146.97 points, 0.5%, to 27,649.78. The S&P 500 index added 19.56 points, or 0.6%, to close at 3,112.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 46.03 points, or 0.5%, to end the session at 8,566.67.

""U.S. stock-index benchmarks recovered some of the week’s lost ground after Bloomberg News, citing sources familiar, reported that Beijing and Washington were making progress toward a phase-one trade pact. The comments also helped to provide a lift to European equities.""

— More S&P 500 companies face an earnings squeeze. WSJ's Akane Otani: ""Investors who have shrugged off tepid earnings growth this year have leaned on the argument that the majority of S&P 500 companies have wound up beating analysts’ expectations. Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management unit isn’t sold on that argument.

""The money manager found in an analysis of earnings that more than a third of S&P 500 companies have posted a year-over-year decline in earnings in 2019. The last times the share of companies posting contracting earnings was that high: 2009, 2008 and 2002, all periods when the broader economy, plus the stock market, were in decline. Will stocks buck the trend this time around? Morgan Stanley Wealth Management isn’t betting on it.""

— Mnuchin warns of issues with global tax rewrite: “The U.S. has ‘serious concerns’ with proposals being discussed in the global rewrite of corporate tax rules, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as he introduced a new idea that could complicate a deal over adapting the tax system for the digital economy,” the Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin and Paul Hannon report.

“In a letter to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Mr. Mnuchin cited concerns raised by U.S. businesses. He said that changing the mandatory rules for when countries have the right to tax companies could affect ‘longstanding pillars of the international tax system upon which U.S. taxpayers rely’ … Nevertheless, Mr. Mnuchin’s reservations come as a surprise given that the broad outlines of new rules agreed to in October were based on ideas advanced by the U.S., which has long pushed for measures that cover all companies, not just those whose businesses are highly digital.”

— Dems see USMCA deal on horizon: “‘We are on the 2 1/2-yard line,’ Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal said about efforts to wrap up negotiations on the replacement for Nafta and clear the way for approval in Congress,” Bloomberg News’s Erik Wasson and Eric Martin report.

“Mexico’s top trade negotiator, Jesus Seade, was meeting … with his Trump administration counterpart Robert Lighthizer in Washington in an attempt to resolve final issues. Neal said rank-and-file Democrats would be briefed on the details of the talks later in the day. California Representative Jimmy Gomez, a member of the U.S. House Democrats negotiating team, said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Lighthizer have offered Mexico a compromise on labor enforcement that ‘respects Mexico’s sovereignty.’ ”

“In response to an op-ed in Politico by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the head of the Chinese Mission to the EU said that claims about Huawei were ‘a far cry from the truth …’ “While Pompeo attacks the Chinese Communist Party and proudly claims the moral high ground, he forgets about the NSA’s notorious PRISM surveillance program and the wiretapping of America’s closest allies,” the Chinese diplomat added … Zhang was responding to the opinion article published Monday in which Pompeo wrote that ‘it’s critical that European countries not give control of their critical infrastructure to Chinese tech giants like Huawei, or ZTE.’ ”

— Amazon cloud boss chides Pentagon: “‘It’s fairly obvious that we feel pretty strongly that it was not adjudicated fairly,’ Amazon Web Services chief executive Andy Jassy said during a news conference at the company’s annual conference [in Las Vegas]. ‘If you do a truly objective, detailed, apples-to-apples comparison with the platforms, you don’t end up in a spot where the decision was made,’” my colleague Jay Greene reports.

“The contract, valued at up to $10 billion over 10 years, was awarded to Microsoft in October, and Amazon has formally challenged the Pentagon’s decision, filing a protest with the Court of Federal Claims last month that cites comments by President Trump as indicating bias against Amazon. Trump has repeatedly criticized Amazon, whose founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.”

— Under Pichai, Alphabet could face more scrutiny: “Alphabet’s leadership change has some investors hoping that the owner of Google will take a hard look at the cash-burning ventures championed by its founders,” Reuters’s Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich report.

“Shares of Alphabet rose 2% ... with some investors saying Pichai’s pragmatic approach and his background at Alphabet’s core business may make him less patient about money-losing projects fostered in recent years by [Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin]. One of the biggest changes for Pichai will be taking responsibility for those so-called ‘moonshots,’ which are aimed at diversifying Alphabet’s business.”

What those “moonshots” include: “Alphabet has plowed billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.”

“Alphabet has plowed billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.” Just how much is a Google worth?: Page and Brin “just got a $2.3 billion retirement gift from investors,” Bloomberg News’s Tom Metcalf reports. “They each own about 6% of the internet giant and still control Alphabet through special voting shares.""

— Expedia’s CEO, CFO ousted: “Expedia Group Inc.’s chief executive and finance chief were both forced to resign after clashing with Chairman Barry Diller and the board over the direction of the travel company,” the WSJ’s Patrick Thomas reports.

“The website that helps users find hotel rooms and flights said Wednesday that CEO Mark Okerstrom and financial chief Alan Pickerill would step down immediately from their roles, at the behest of the board. Expedia’s brands include Hotels.com, Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire and CarRentals.com.”

— Italy claims Fiat massively undervalued Chrysler: “Italian tax authorities have claimed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV underestimated the value of its American business by 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion) following its phased acquisition several years ago, presenting the carmaker with a potentially hefty bill as it prepares to merge with French rival PSA Group,” Bloomberg’s Daniele Lepido,Tommaso Ebhardt and Ania Nussbaum report.

“The dispute relates to the October 2014 restructuring that took place after the former Fiat SpA purchased the final part of its Chrysler unit, according to company filings and an Oct. 22 audit report seen by Bloomberg. The purchases stretched over five years and culminated in the full takeover of the once-bankrupt owner of brands such as Dodge, Ram and Jeep.”

“After an unsuccessful objection from his lawyer, Musk told the jury he has Tesla stock, and SpaceX stock, with debt against those holdings, and his net worth is about $20 billion. But contrary to public opinion, he said, he didn’t have much cash. Musk finished testifying after a total of about six hours on the stand over two days.”

— Walmart talks about how it collects data: “Walmart Inc for the first time … revealed the breadth of customer information it collects as it came out in favor of consumers having ‘reasonable controls’ with regard to collection, use and sharing of personal data,” Reuters’s Nandita Bose reports.

“The world’s largest retailer said shoppers should have an opportunity to ‘reasonably access, correct or delete their data while limiting the sale of their data to third parties and its use in digital advertising,’ as it testified at a hearing by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The hearing, which was also attended by companies like Microsoft, was convened to examine various legislative proposals to protect consumer data privacy.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Biden releases $3.2 trillion tax plan: “Former vice president Joe Biden released a plan to raise $3.2 trillion in taxes over 10 years to pay for his domestic spending proposals, including on health care and climate, as he seeks to cast himself as the fiscal moderate in the Democratic presidential primary amid pressure from his liberal rivals,” my colleague Jeff Stein reports.

“Biden’s plan calls for raising the tax rate paid by corporations from 21 percent to 28 percent, still below the 35 percent level in place before the 2017 GOP tax cut law. He also plans to raise $800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors, as well as $400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes, among other measures … The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.”

How it compares: “The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s. Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.”

The fight over Harris’s donors has begun: Sen. Kamala Harris’s “most affluent fundraisers, spanning from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, have been receiving calls and emails from people close to top-tier candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker. These people are hoping to snag the support of the bundlers and their donor networks,” CNBC’s Brian Schwartz reports.

Warren trolls Bloomberg on Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren accused former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg of trying to buy the 2020 election with millions of dollars in advertising to fuel his late entry into the Democratic race,” Bloomberg’s Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou and Joe Weisenthal report.

“Warren delivered her message in an interview on Bloomberg Television from the company’s headquarters in New York City. ‘I don’t believe that elections ought to be for sale,’ Warren said. ‘And I don’t think as a Democratic Party that we should say that the only way you’re going to get elected, the only way you’re going to be our nominee, is either if you are a billionaire or if you’re sucking up to billionaires.’”

That wasn’t all: Before the interview, Warren bought an ad to air on the network that directly attacked its owner-turned-candidate:

Warren proposes crackdown on bank mergers. NYT's Jeanna Smialek: ""Warren plans to introduce a bill in coming weeks that would intensify the scrutiny of bank mergers, a signal less of legislative action to come than of her intentions for the finance industry if she is elected president.

""The bill, a companion of which will be introduced Wednesday in the House by Representative Jesús 'Chuy' García, Democrat of Illinois, will almost certainly go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. But its argument that the 'review process for bank mergers is fundamentally broken' indicates that Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, still has the financial industry in her sights.""

New Georgia senator is ready to cut a big check to her campaign: “Soon-to-be Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler plans to spend $20 million of her own money on her 2020 Senate campaign in Georgia — a massive sum that could give potential rivals pause about trying to unseat her,” Politico’s Alex Isenstadt reports.

“Loeffler, a wealthy financial executive and co-owner of Atlanta’s WNBA team, was tapped Wednesday morning to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who is resigning later this month due to health problems, on an interim basis. She has told advisers in recent days of her intentions to tap her vast fortune to win next year's special election to complete Isakson's term, according to a person with direct knowledge of the decision.”

Loeffler is heavily connected to Bitcoin: “Loeffler has been the chief executive of Bakkt, the Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin-focused subsidiary, since the entity’s announcement in August 2018,” Coindesk’s Nikhilesh De reports. “Under her tenure, the company rolled out its physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts earlier this year.

While the report does not outline the specific articles of impeachment the president could face in the House, it signals that Democrats are at least preparing to accuse of him of obstructing Congress, finding that a dozen witnesses “followed President Trump’s orders, defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify.”

The House Judiciary Committee is charged with drafting the articles and will hold its first impeachment hearing Wednesday, with constitutional scholars set to testify. The rapid timeline puts the House on pace to impeach Trump by Christmas. The fight will then move to the Senate, where the White House and its allies believe that the president will be acquitted by the Republican-controlled chamber.

At the heart of Democrats’ case is their allegation that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine in the face of Russian military aggression, to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Trump has repeatedly said he did nothing wrong and has derided the impeachment inquiry as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.”

“I think it’s a disgrace. I think the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in London, where he is attending a NATO meeting. “If you look at impeachment, the word ‘impeachment,’ here there was nothing wrong, nothing done wrong.”

Democrats’ findings are primarily drawn from the testimony of witnesses who appeared before the Intelligence Committee last month, as well as the rough transcript of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky released by the White House, in which Trump asks the Ukrainian leader to “do us a favor though” with regard to the investigations.

AD

But the report also includes records showing that Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who orchestrated the pressure campaign against Ukraine, made phone calls to the White House and its budget office during key moments of the investigation.

AD

The records show he called the White House repeatedly on April 24, the day then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was summoned to Washington and removed from her post in Kyiv. Giuliani publicly alleged that she was anti-Trump, although Yovanovitch’s colleagues, including senior State Department officials, have defended her as an exemplary public servant.

Giuliani called the White House at least seven times on April 24 between 7:47 a.m. and 8:09 p.m. He also received a call from a White House number and spent more than eight minutes speaking to someone identified only as “-1” in the report.

The records do not provide any details about the nature of the calls or whether Giuliani spoke with Trump. On Twitter and in television appearances that day, Giuliani promoted the debunked theory, embraced by the president, about alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

In a news conference Tuesday, Schiff declined to say how his committee obtained the phone records but said they showed “considerable coordination” among key figures, including the White House, in the campaign to oust Yovanovitch.

The report also details calls that Giuliani made in August to people whose phone numbers are associated with the White House Office of Management and Budget, at a time when an Oval Office meeting for Zelensky was being sought and Trump had placed a hold on the military aid for Ukraine.

AD

And the report reveals new contacts between the Intelligence Committee’s ranking Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), and Giuliani, as well as other newly disclosed phone records that suggest Giuliani may have talked to Trump and Fox News host Sean Hannity on April 25, the same day Joe Biden declared his presidential bid.

AD

Trump was a guest on Hannity’s show that night and discussed a column by the conservative columnist John Solomon that described Biden’s efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor while he was vice president and questioned whether Biden had acted to protect his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence to back up that claim.

In a partisan, 13-to-9 vote Tuesday night, the House Intelligence Committee approved sending the report to the Judiciary panel. Republicans on the Intelligence Committee had issued their own report Monday, asserting that the majority party did not sufficiently make the case that Trump had committed impeachable offenses in the Ukraine matter.

“House Democrats have been trying to undo the results of President Trump’s historic election since before he was sworn in,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a statement praising the minority report.

The increasingly partisan impeachment fight continues as polling shows that the public remains deeply divided on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office.

Though the number of Americans who favored impeachment rose initially after the inquiry was announced in September, a Washington Post average of nationally representative polls conducted since the start of the public hearings on Nov. 13 found that the level of support for impeaching and removing Trump stood at 47 percent — little different from the 47 percent in the two weeks before the hearings began and 48 percent earlier in October. In key general-election states such as Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin, fewer voters back impeachment.

AD

The White House, which does not plan to participate in Wednesday’s hearing, continued its scathing criticism of how the Democrats have conducted their inquiry in its response to the report.

AD

“At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. “This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff’s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.”

In London, Trump said he would like top officials who have so far refused to cooperate in the House impeachment inquiry — such as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — to testify, but only in the Senate, where he believes he will get a fair trial.

AD

The White House has trained its focus on the Senate, where the president and his allies think they can fight on more favorable terrain against charges that he abused his office for political gain. Senate Republicans have been more muted in their defense of the president than their House colleagues but continue to back Trump, and it is highly unlikely at this point that two-thirds of the chamber would vote to remove him from office.

AD

White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who began strategizing with a small group of Senate Republicans last month on how to handle an impeachment trial, plans to attend a lunch with GOP senators Wednesday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has sidestepped most questions about the impending trial, on Tuesday outlined three scenarios that would help determine which witnesses are called and how the Senate proceedings would unfold.

One option is that McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) would negotiate a bipartisan deal on trial procedure, although the two leaders have yet to begin such discussions. Absent that, McConnell could attempt to round up 51 GOP senators in support of some procedural package.

The third option — which holds the most potential for chaos and is the least tantalizing course for the majority leader — would be for each side to put forward motions for witnesses and other procedural mechanisms one at a time, and senators would vote on each of them individually.

As the impeachment process continues, an increasing number of Senate Republicans have begun embracing the evidence-free claim — leveled primarily by Trump and his allies — that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election. That’s despite congressional testimony from administration officials and intelligence assessments that have found no merit to the claim that Ukrainians, and not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee email system in 2016.

“There’s no difference in the way Russia put their feet early on the scale, being for one candidate, and everybody called it meddling, and how the Ukrainian officials did it,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Tuesday, the second consecutive day he stated such claims.

From the Senate floor, Schumer called GOP assertions that Ukraine interfered “appalling.”

David Hale, the third-ranking official at the State Department, testified Tuesday that he was not aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election — and he supported the assessment of Fiona Hill, former White House National Security Council director for Russia and Europe, that the talking point was Russian propaganda.

“I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters Tuesday."

THE BIG IDEA: After the 8 1/2-hour impeachment inquiry hearing wrapped up last night, Rep. Louie Gohmert (Tex.) joined the other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee for a news conference. “All I got to say is: If you love America, mamas, don't let your babies grow up to go to Harvard or Stanford law school,” Gohmert said.

Constitutional scholars from those two institutions, invited to testify by the Democrats, had just finished laying out arguments for why President Trump’s conduct warrants impeachment.

Gohmert’s quip was a play on the country song popularized by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson in 1978: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. … Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.”

It was a fitting coda to a day that showcased a virulent strain of anti-elitism, even anti-intellectualism, that has flared up as Trump hijacked the GOP from the establishmentarians who once called the shots.

Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the committee, set the tone in his opening statement. “America will see why most people don’t go to law school,” he declared. “No offense to our professors. But please. Really? We’re bringing you in here today to testify on stuff … that we already know, out of the classrooms that maybe you're getting ready for finals in, to discuss things that you probably haven't even had a chance to [read or watch].”

Collins, who just got passed over for a Senate appointment despite Trump pressuring the governor of Georgia to pick him, pooh-poohed a sober-minded discussion about when the Founding Fathers thought impeachment would be advisable as “esoteric.”

Paul Taylor, the chief counsel for Republicans on the committee, suggested as he began questioning the four witnesses that the legal profession as a whole is somehow controlled by the left. He claimed at the start of his questioning – without any citations – that 97 percent of campaign contributions from lawyers during the 2016 presidential campaign went to Hillary Clinton while Trump received only 3 percent. “And the situation is essentially the same at law schools around the country, including those represented on the panel here today,” Taylor said.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who told reporters at the start of the day how much he disliked attending lectures in law school, told Stanford Law School Professor Pamela Karlan that she was unable to see from “the ivory towers of your law school” how condescending she was being to “actual people in this country.”

And so it went.

-- The attacks on law schools and the legal profession in general reflect the broader focus on process and style over substance in Trump’s defense strategy. There is little dispute about the underlying facts of the case, even as a growing body of evidence directly ties Trump to an alleged conspiracy to coerce the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into a 2020 challenger, former vice president Joe Biden, in exchange for transferring nearly $400 million of military aid, which Congress had already approved, and scheduling a coveted meeting with a neophyte president who was desperate to project strength in the face of an ongoing Russian occupation in his country.

-- Marginalizing experts and debasing expertise have been hallmarks of the Trump presidency. Trump doesn’t just reject climate science. His administration has suppressed research. He’s purged nonpartisan experts from an array of government agencies. He still refuses to accept the consensus of the professionals in the intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to boost his candidacy.

The manager of Trump’s reelection campaign, Brad Parscale, referred to the scholars invited by Democrats to testify as “the Three Stooges” on Twitter. “Just more of the same old sham!” he wrote.

-- The criticism of the professional class offers another proof point to illustrate why so many white-collar suburbanites who have traditionally supported Republicans have defected during the Trump era. But Trump has proven to also be a magnet for non-college-educated whites in the Rust Belt who are ancestrally Democratic, accelerating a once-in-a-generation realignment.

-- Karlan replied forcefully to Collins’s suggestion that she knew not of what she spoke. “I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts. I’m insulted by the suggestion that, as a law professor, I don’t care about the facts,” Karlan said. “I spent all of Thanksgiving vacation sitting there, reading these transcripts. … I ate, like, a turkey that came to us in the mail that was already cooked because I was spending my time doing this.”

-- Rank-and-file Republicans have soured considerably on the value of colleges and universities in recent years. A Pew Research Center study published in August showed that only 33 percent of Republicans see value in higher education, down from 53 percent in 2012. “Roughly eight-in-ten Republicans (79%) say professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom is a major reason why the higher education system is headed in the wrong direction (only 17% of Democrats say the same),” according to Pew. “And three-quarters of Republicans (vs. 31% of Democrats) point to too much concern about protecting students from views they might find offensive as a major reason for their views.”

-- The criticism of the legal profession came even though 15 of the 17 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee hold law degrees. Overall, 161 House members and 53 senators earned juris doctorates, according to the Congressional Research Service.

-- House Democrats signaled there will be at least one article of impeachment related to the 10 episodes of potential obstruction of justice outlined in Robert Mueller’s report. “President Trump welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election. He demanded it for the 2020 election. In both cases, he got caught,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

-- University of North Carolina Law Professor Michael Gerhardt, one of the witnesses, testified that an obstruction case against Trump is a slam dunk, citing the administration’s stated refusal to comply with any subpoenas for documents and depositions. “In our law schools, we would teach our students this is an easy, straightforward situation,” he said.

Gerhardt also argued that what Trump asked of the Ukrainians is impeachable, as well. “I just want to stress that if what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" he said. “This is precisely the misconduct that the Framers created a Constitution including impeachment to protect against. … If we cannot impeach a president who uses his power for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy.”

-- Even the witness that Republicans invited to testify, George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley, said that Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “anything but perfect.” But Turley argued that it’s not impeachable and accused Democrats of rushing to impeach without the testimony of key witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton and Mike Pompeo – who are refusing, at Trump’s direction, to appear.“If you rush this impeachment, you’re going to leave half the country behind,” he said.He later called the Democratic case “not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous.”

-- “Impeachment goes to college” is how Dan Zak and Ben Terris framed the hearing in their write-up for the Style section: “After last month’s testimony from bow-tied diplomats and stone-faced bureaucrats — ‘fact witnesses’ who actually saw or heard Trump’s inciting behavior — the impeachment process has reached the peer-review phase. During this hearing, professors referenced a 1640 sermon by John Winthrop and a 1792 edition of Samuel Johnson’s dictionary. There were multiple odes to forgotten founder William Richardson Davie, the onetime governor of North Carolina who argued fiercely for an impeachment provision in drafts of the Constitution. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) had in front of him a tattered college copy of the Federalist Papers, scrawled with marginalia.”

-- When he got a chance to question Karlan, Gaetz noted that the professor has given campaign contributions to Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He asked her about a comment she made on a podcast that suggested liberals cluster in tighter communities while conservatives tend to spread out. “Do you understand how that reflects contempt on people who are conservative?” Gaetz asked. “No, what I was talking about there was the natural tendency -- if you put the quote in context – the natural tendency of a compactness requirement to favor a party whose voters are more spread out,” she answered. “I do not have contempt for conservatives.”

Karlan later apologized for “getting a little overheated.” She also apologized for quipping earlier in the day that “the president can name his son Barron,” but he can’t make him a baron. “It was wrong of me to do that,” she said, after Republicans attacked her. “I wish the president would apologize, obviously, for the things that he's done that are wrong, but I do regret having said that.”

“That does not lend credibility to your argument,” Gaetz told her. “It makes you look mean.”

-- One Republican on the committee also floated a new defense of the president: Everybody does it. Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said that basically every president could have been impeached under the standards cited by Democrats for abuse of power. “When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he was president, directed the IRS to conduct audits of his political enemies ... would that be impeachable conduct?” Buck asked Turley. “How about when President Kennedy directed his brother, Robert Kennedy, to deport one of his mistresses as an East German spy?”

“Turley said he couldn’t rule it out, nor could he do so when Buck asked about allegations that President Lyndon Johnson used the CIA to plant a spy in the campaign of his 1964 Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater,” Mike DeBonis notes. “Buck ultimately landed on Obama, pointing to his interpretation of the recess appointments power that was later rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court, as well as his response to the 2012 Benghazi attack.”

“Can you name a single president in the history of the United States — save President [William Henry] Harrison, who died 32 days after his inauguration — that would not have met the standard of impeachment for our friends here?” Buck asked.

“I would hope to God James Madison would escape,” said Turley, who has written about Madison. “Otherwise, a lifetime of academic work would be shredded. But once again, I can’t exclude many of these acts.”

Buck reasoned that, if Democrats impeach Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine, Republicans will impeach the next Democratic president if they have control of the House because the concept of what’s in the “national interest” is so open for debate.

“Some people live in an ivory tower and some people live in a swamp,” Buck said. “And those of us that are in the swamp are doing our very best for the American people, but it’s not pretty.”

“Well, actually, I live in an ivory tower in a swamp because I'm at G.W.,” Turley replied. “But it's not so bad.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a brief speech this morning that she’s asked House committee chairs to proceed with articles of impeachment, saying lawmakers have “no choice but to act.” “The president has engaged in abuse of power undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections,” she said. “His actions are in defiance of the vision of our founders and the oath of office that he takes to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Sadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our Founders and our heart full of love for America, today I’m asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.” She didn’t give any indication of how quickly the process would move.

-- Attorney General Bill Barr’s handpicked prosecutor, John Durham, told Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that he can’t back up the right-wing conspiracy theory that the Russia investigation was a setup by American intelligence. Horowitz’s office contacted Durham, “the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett scoop. “The inspector general also contacted several U.S. intelligence agencies. Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign … But the intelligence agencies said the professor was not among their assets … And Durham informed Horowitz’s office that his investigation had not produced any evidence that might contradict the inspector general’s findings on that point. … That could rebut conservatives’ doubts — which Barr has shared with associates in recent weeks — that Horowitz might be blessing the FBI’s Russia investigation prematurely and that Durham could potentially find more, particularly with regard to the Maltese professor.”

-- Rudy Giuliani, trying to poke holes in the case against his client, is in Kyiv and Budapest this week to talk with former Ukrainian prosecutors. From the Times’ Ken Vogel and Benjamin Novak: “Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk … Mr. Giuliani is using the trip … to help prepare more episodes of a documentary series for a conservative television outlet promoting his pro-Trump, anti-impeachment narrative. His latest moves to advance the theories propounded by the prosecutors amount to an audacious effort to give the president’s supporters new material to undercut the House impeachment proceedings and an eventual Senate trial.”

-- The White House is preparing for an aggressive effort to defend Trump in the Senate. Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian report: “Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs, told reporters that Trump ‘wants his case made fully in the Senate,’ previewing a strategy that would include live witnesses on the floor, rather than videotaped depositions that were entered into evidence during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999. … Ueland was among a quartet of top White House officials, including Counsel Pat Cipollone, who met with GOP senators on Wednesday as the administration continues to strategize with Republicans on the Senate proceedings. The private session … underscored the extent to which Trump has largely blown off the House inquiry and is focusing on a likely trial in the GOP-controlled Senate, where the White House says he would get a fair defense and can easily win an acquittal.”

-- But Trump opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee’s first hearing, unlike Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. Paul Kane reports: “Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump’s side.”

-- Joe Biden said he would not voluntarily appear as a witness in a Senate impeachment trial if called to testify. Colby Itkowitz reports: “‘No, I’m not going to let them take their eye off the ball,’ Biden said [in Iowa]. … ‘The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes. And I’m not going to let them divert from that, I’m not going to let anyone divert from that.’ Biden added that he’d released 21 years of his tax returns, so if Trump is worried about corruption, ‘let him release some of his.’”

-- Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) announced he will not seek reelection. From Politico: “Heck, 67, was first elected in 2012 to represent a [solidly blue] district southwest of Seattle. He said in a Medium post he had time over the Thanksgiving recess for ‘rest and reflection,’ which led to his retirement decision. … Heck also wrote that the process of compiling the intelligence committee's recent impeachment report had left him ‘discouraged’ about continuing to serve in Congress. ‘The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary,’ Heck wrote. ‘I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.’”

Sandra Diaz, a former employee of the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster and an undocumented immigrant, poses for a portrait at home in Bound Brook, N.J. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Undocumented workers who served Trump recall his habits and outbursts: Joshua Partlow and Dave Fahrenthold have interviewed 48 people this year who worked illegally for the Trump Organization at 11 of its properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Virginia: “They have seen poolside tantrums and holiday arguments. They’ve laughed with the in-laws and watched after the grandkids. Their recollections also show how Trump’s entrance into presidential politics — denouncing illegal immigrants as criminals and job-stealers — upended their lives and prompted some of them to publicly confront their former boss.” Here are choice nuggets from their must-read piece:

“It was important for Sandra Diaz to be invisible. Before entering the Trump family villa, she would tie back her hair, pull on latex gloves and step into delicate paper shoe coverings. She knew not to wear makeup or perfume that might leave the faintest trace of her presence. As Donald Trump’s personal housekeeper, Diaz was dealing with a fussy celebrity owner who presided like a monarch over the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster long before he was elevated to president. She was an immigrant from Costa Rica working illegally for Trump with a fake Social Security card she had bought for $50. Being invisible was her life’s work. Moving quickly through the two-story house in the mornings, Diaz carried out Trump’s fastidious instructions. In his closet, she would hang six sets of identical golf outfits: six white polo shirts, six pairs of beige pants, six neatly ironed pairs of boxer shorts. …

“Those who cooked and served Trump knew that he liked … his Diet Coke in small glass bottles with a plastic straw that no one could be seen touching. Trump loved Tic Tacs. But not an arbitrary amount. He wanted, in his bedroom bureau at all times, two full containers of white Tic Tacs and one container that was half full. The same rule applied to the Bronx Colors-brand face makeup from Switzerland that Trump slathered on — two full containers, one half full — even if it meant the housekeepers had to regularly bring new shirts from the pro shop because of the rust-colored stains on the collars. A special washing machine in the laundry room was reserved for his wife Melania Trump’s clothing. Donald Trump liked Irish Spring bar soap in his shower. But his housekeepers quickly learned not to throw out his soap even if it had worn down to the tiniest sliver: Trump decided when he wanted something discarded. When that happened, with clothes or newspapers, he would toss them on the floor.

“A regular recipient of Trump’s castoff clothing was Melania’s father, Viktor Knavs … ‘They’re the same size and everything,’ [said Victorina Morales, Diaz’s successor as Trump’s housekeeper at Bedminster]. Knavs and his wife, Amalija Knavs, were favorites of the Bedminster staff, even if much was lost in translation from Slovenian to Spanish. … One day in 2013, Viktor Knavs went out to play golf wearing one of Trump’s discarded red baseball caps. When Trump spotted him on the fairway, he blew up, and he ordered his father-in-law, in front of other golfers, to remove the hat and get off the course. … Diaz and Morales were in the villa when Knavs returned, threw the hat on the ground and cursed Trump. The housekeepers pieced together the story from what Amalija Knavs told them in English and what they heard from the caddies who were on the course at the time. ‘Nobody could wear the red hat but [Trump],’ Diaz said.”

-- The Post’s year-long investigation on Trump’s employment of undocumented workers has led to these five additional findings:

At least 11 Trump properties hired undocumented workers, some who said they started working for Trump 17 years ago. Trump said in July he wasn't sure if his company employed undocumented workers. But many former workers said it's hard to believe that the managers didn't know. The Trump Organization didn’t face many legal consequences for using undocumented labor. The workers, however, have lost their jobs and have found it hard to get back on their feet after being fired by the organization. Some have also been ostracized by other undocumented workers who fear that the attention might put them at greater deportation risk. While some of the undocumented workers entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, others arrived on flights with tourist visas that they overstayed. In those cases, Trump’s promised border wall wouldn’t have mattered.

-- A gunman opened fire at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam near Honolulu, killing two and injuring a third before killing himself, base officials said. Reis Thebault and Marisa Iati report: “The shooter was identified as an active-duty U.S. Navy sailor and the three victims as civilian Defense Department employees working on the base’s shipyard. The surviving victim is at a hospital in stable condition, Rear Adm. Robb Chadwick said in a Wednesday evening news conference. The shooter’s motive is still unknown, Chadwick said, and it wasn’t yet clear whether the attack was targeted or random.”

-- Birds are getting smaller, and scientists believe it’s because of global warming. Ben Guarino reports: “So shows an analysis of migratory birds that died after colliding into buildings in Chicago and were collected as specimens for the Field Museum of Natural History. David Willard, a Field Museum ornithologist, has measured the Windy City’s dead birds since 1978. Data from his calipers and scales reveal decades-long trends in bird bodies: Their legs, on average, are growing shorter. They have lost weight. Their wings are getting slightly longer. These changes are present in nearly all of the species he measured, according to a study of 70,716 bird specimens from almost 40 years published Wednesday in the journal Ecology Letters. Morphing birds, Willard and his colleagues say, reflect a changing climate. ‘Warming temperatures seem to be having a pretty consistent and almost universal effect on a large number of different species, regardless of other aspects of their biology,’ said study author Benjamin Winger, who studies the evolution and ecology of birds at the University of Michigan.”

-- The freak storms of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season have left behind a trail of destruction. Matthew Cappucci reports: “Both Dorian and Lorenzo, which became the strongest hurricane to develop so far northeast in the Atlantic, attained Category 5 strength. The storms brought the count of Category 5s in the Atlantic since 2016 up to six, and marked the fourth year in a row with at least one Category 5, the longest stretch on record. The historic intensity of both Dorian and Lorenzo, along with the record-setting rains produced by storms Barry and Imelda in the United States, exhibited influences consistent with warming ocean waters and climate change. … This year had an above-average season. It was only the seventh season since the 1930s to rack up multiple Category 5s over the Atlantic Basin. Across the board, 24 percent more ‘accumulated cyclone energy’ than average was expended by storms this season. It also brought about one of the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfalls on record. But many in the United States view the season as a reprieve for the storm-beleaguered country, noting that only two hurricanes made landfall in the United States this season, along with one tropical storm. Both hurricanes were at Category 1 strength when they did so. The year was still incredibly active; the contiguous United States just got lucky.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Trump administration is considering sending 14,000 more troops to the Middle East to counter Iran. From the Wall Street Journal: “The deployment could double the number of U.S. military personnel who have been sent to the region since the start of a troop buildup in May. [Trump] is expected to make a decision on the new deployments as soon as this month … There is growing fear among U.S. military and other administration officials that an attack on U.S. interests and forces could leave the U.S. with few options in the region ... By sending additional military resources to the region, the administration would be presenting a more credible deterrent to Tehran, which has been blamed for a series of attacks, including one in September against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Iran has denied involvement.”

-- U.S. intelligence officials believe Iran is secretly moving missiles into Iraq. From the New York Times: “New intelligence about Iran’s stockpiling of missiles in Iraq is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s efforts to deter Tehran by increasing the American military presence in the Middle East has largely failed. The missiles pose a threat to American allies and partners in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and could endanger American troops ... Both Iran and Iraq have been gripped in recent weeks by sometimes violent public protests. In Iraq, some are protesting against Iranian influence.”

-- German authorities said they suspect that Russian agents were behind an execution-style killing in Berlin in the summer and expelled two Russian diplomats in connection with the case. Loveday Morris reports from Berlin and Robyn Dixon reports from Moscow: “The federal public prosecutor said there was ‘sufficient factual evidence’ that the Aug. 23 killing was carried out by Russian intelligence agencies or those of Russia’s Chechen Republic. The German Foreign Ministry declared two employees of the Russian Embassy in Berlin ‘persona non gratae,’ saying that Russian authorities have not cooperated with the investigation ‘sufficiently’ despite repeated ‘high-ranking’ requests. The killing compounds concerns about Russia’s efforts to assassinate political opponents on European soil less than two years after Britain accused Moscow of attacking former Russian agent turned informant Sergei Skripal with nerve agent in Salisbury, England. … [This] would represent the first such slaying on German soil since the end of the Cold War. It threatens to stymie relations between Berlin and Moscow, a fragile bond for Germany, which tries to balance political differences against its energy needs.

“Berlin prosecutors named the victim, who was shot in the head in a central Berlin park, as ‘Tornike K.’ — a 40-year-old Russian-Georgian citizen … Between 2000 and 2004, he commanded a Chechen militia that fought Russian forces during the Russian-Chechen war … The slain man also fought with a Georgian unit defending South Ossetia during the 2008 Georgia-Russia war … He survived a 2015 assassination attempt, despite being shot four times, and later fled to Germany, where he claimed asylum. … [H]e was tailed by a man on an electric bicycle before being shot with a Glock-26 pistol.” This is right out of the Kremlin's playbook.

-- Ukranian and Russian leaders will try to seal a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and agree on prisoner swaps when they meet next week. From Reuters: “With Kiev politically constrained and Moscow unlikely to bend, prospects for peace remain bleak, diplomats said. … Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions. Key to the accords are elections in the disputed eastern Donbass region of Ukraine. But both sides accuse each other of failing to stick to the deal, which includes restoring Ukrainian state control over the entire border with Russia and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the conflict zone.”

-- As the NATO summit concluded, ""Trump abruptly canceled a planned news conference, saying that he had already answered so many questions from reporters in other settings during his visit to Britain. He took off for Washington,"" Michael Birnbaum, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report from London. ""Though his conduct here fit his pattern of disruption at international summits, Trump did not make the fiery threats that have punctuated previous gatherings. NATO leaders were almost giddy as they survived another encounter with Trump with their alliance intact. Trump’s canceled news conference — eliminating one last chance for him to take aim at them — was to many the departure gift.”

-- The British Conservative Party breathed a sigh of relief after Trump left the U.K. without smashing its election strategy. From Politico: “It means [Boris Johnson] survived the Trump visit without any extra obstacles being put in his way ahead of the December 12 vote. … Johnson spent two days working hard to avoid being pictured with Trump, who is deeply unpopular in the U.K. He did not greet the president at the door of Downing Street when world leaders arrived for a reception on Wednesday night. The only photos of Johnson and Trump together were the full NATO group shot and the obligatory opening handshake snap.”

-- France is bracing for massive transportation disruptions starting today as trade unions launch a strike in response to changes Emmanuel Macron wants to make to the country’s retirement system. James McAuley reports: “Much of the Paris Metro will be shut down, as will many national and international train lines, including certain Eurostar services. Flights also will be canceled, as air traffic controllers say they will join the protests through Saturday. Strikes and protests, of course, are a well-known fixture of French life, from the student uprisings of 1968 to the ‘yellow vest’ demonstrations against inequality that stunned the French government last year with their vigor and violence. No other Western democracy seems to have as high a tolerance for burning cars and broken windows. But these protests could be bigger and more destabilizing than most.”

-- Australia is blocking asylum seekers held offshore from seeking medical care in the country. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton claims the policy has helped people migrate into Australia ‘through the back door.’ Physicians and refugee advocates say it has saved sick asylum seekers’ lives. And Wednesday, Australian lawmakers voted narrowly to revoke the policy, in what Doctors Without Borders described as a move that ‘endangers patients in need and ignores the ethical framework of the entire medical profession.’ At least 135 asylum seekers have sought treatment or assessment in Australia since the policy was approved this year. The law required physicians to deem their transfer to Australia necessary. It is unclear whether these asylum seekers are still in Australia.”

2020 WATCH:

-- The Democratic candidates have joined a new race – courting supporters of Kamala Harris. Annie Linskey, Chelsea Janes and Holly Bailey report: “Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next. … The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters. At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and [Biden] appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women. The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.”

-- Democrats were once excited about their diverse candidate field. That thrill is gone. Michael Scherer reports: “A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white. … The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black. … The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.”

-- Biden said he would consider Harris as a potential running mate. From CNN: “‘Of course I would,’ Biden said. ‘Look, Sen. Harris has the capacity to be anything she wants to be. I mean it sincerely. I talked to her yesterday. She's solid, she can be president someday herself, she can be vice president, she could go on to be a Supreme Court justice, she could be attorney general. I mean she has enormous capability.’”

-- The former vice president has not been energizing voters during his week-long bus tour around Iowa. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “The ‘No Malarkey’ tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails [Pete] Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors...""

Gabbard tweeted out a photo of a snowbound yoga session at her new place Tuesday.”

-- A Republican House candidate called for Rep. Ilhan Omar’s (D-Minn.) execution. Katie Mettler and Hannah Knowles report: “In a fundraising letter sent last week and first reported on Tuesday by the Tampa Bay Times, the campaign of George Buck, a St. Petersburg Republican running for Congress, repeated falsehoods about Omar’s alleged ties to foreign nations. ‘We should hang these traitors where they stand,’ the email said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In an initial comment to that newspaper, Buck denied writing the campaign email, which arrived in the form of a letter and bore his signature. ‘That was not me. I did not see that,’ Buck told Times reporter Steve Contorno. ‘I would never talk like that.’ But Buck sent another statement later in the day that cited the federal punishment for treason, which includes death, prison time of at least five years and a fine of not less than $10,000. … House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (La.) disavowed Buck’s words in a statement Wednesday, saying ‘there’s no place for inciting violence in politics.’”

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) shows no signs of voluntarily resigning from the House, despite his guilty plea to a felony campaign finance charge. From Politico: “When asked Wednesday about whether and when he intended to resign, Hunter blew off the question. ‘Good talk,’ Hunter told a Politico reporter. So far, neither Republican nor Democratic leaders have pressured Hunter to leave office, although there is precedent for expelling members who don’t step down following a criminal conviction. Hunter is not scheduled to be sentenced until March 17.”

Stephen Colbert had a few ideas about what Rudy Giuliani’s conversations with “-1” were like:"
224,Joe Davidson,"Although he and the whistleblower followed proper procedures, they have been subjected to criticisms as messengers of bad news.

Trump considered firing Atkinson, the New York Times reported, because the inspector general found the whistleblower’s complaint credible.

AD

AD

Atkinson didn’t mention Ukraine, but his reference to “recent events” is clear.

The complaint, about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find damaging information related to a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, was substantially confirmed during two weeks of public hearings last month by the House Intelligence Committee.

Nonetheless, Trump has insisted his call with Zelensky was “perfect.” Republicans have adamantly defended Trump, as they did in a staff report issued Monday that repeatedly criticized the whistleblower.

Atkinson’s defense of whistleblowers comes with a dose of uncertainty.

“Time will tell whether whistleblowers’ rights and protections will emerge from this period with the same legal, ethical, and moral strength they had previously,” he wrote. “It is my hope that recent events will not have a chilling effect on the willingness of individuals within the Intelligence Community to continue to shed light on suspected fraud, waste, abuse, or malfeasance in an authorized manner.”

AD

AD

That chilling effect is real in a government that punishes whistleblowers even as it celebrates them.

Atkinson, along with the other 70-plus inspectors general throughout the federal government, issues twice-yearly accounts of audits, management concerns and other sleepy topics that generate more snooze than news. But Atkinson used his latest report to defend whistleblowers and inspectors general broadly in the face of right-wing attacks.

Calling inspectors general “first responders” to “the most egregious matters, abuses of authority,” Atkinson, a former Justice Department official, said they “are able to fulfill their critical oversight function because, by law, they are independent of the agencies they oversee.” It’s a passage administration officials should take as instruction.

AD

Atkinson was not alone among inspectors general whose semiannual reports sent a message supporting whistleblowers.

AD

Kristi M. Waschull, the Defense Intelligence Agency inspector general, used her opening message to champion anonymity for whistleblowers who want it, even as Republicans on Capitol Hill have sought to unmask the Ukraine informant.

“Overall, maintaining confidentiality is of the utmost importance,” she wrote. “We do not disclose the identity of any whistleblower without their consent — unless disclosure is unavoidable, as required by law.”

Glenn A. Fine, head of the inspector general’s office at the Pentagon, added by email that “whistleblowers need to be protected from reprisals for their protected disclosures.” Waschull’s and Atkinson’s messages were previously reported by Government Executive.

AD

Atkinson received widespread support from his fellow inspectors general when almost all of them signed a letter backing him in his dispute with Trump’s Justice Department.

AD

A Sept. 3 memo from Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel concluded that because, in his view, the Ukraine whistleblower’s complaint “does not involve an ‘urgent concern,’ ” it did not require transmittal to Congress, as Atkinson did.

The letter from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency responded by saying Engel’s position “could seriously undermine the critical role whistleblowers play in coming forward to report waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct across the federal government” and “has the potential to undermine IG [inspector general] independence across the federal government.”

AD

Allowing other agency officials to second-guess decisions by inspectors general would be contrary to their independence and, the council’s letter added, “may impede the ability of Congress and taxpayers to obtain the objective and independent oversight they rely on from IGs.”

AD

“That would be a grave loss for IG oversight and, as a result, for the American taxpayer,” the letter concluded.

To create safer spaces for whistleblowers, their supporters want Congress to approve additional protections for federal employees who expose waste, fraud and abuse.

Among other measures, advocates have called for legislation that explicitly prohibits revealing whistleblowers’ identities if they want confidentiality. One long-standing proposal would allow federal whistleblowers to have civil jury trials in lawsuits against agencies accused of retaliation.

AD

Despite attempts to expose the Ukraine whistleblower’s identity and the Trump administration’s attempt to undermine Atkinson’s independence, he remains confident about the role of whistleblowers in the federal government.

“I am confident that those rights and protections will ultimately emerge stronger, and will not be diminished in any respect,” he wrote. “My optimism comes from my belief that the American people want an honest and effective government that reflects their hard-fought values.”

Andriy Derkach is an independent member of Ukraine’s parliament who has caught Giuliani’s eye by pushing for his own government to investigate former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden. As Time magazine reports, though, Derkach hasn’t really produced any information suggesting actual wrongdoing, and he hasn’t gotten much traction.

AD

Derkach’s name is a big one in Ukraine. A story about him might have even helped sparked that country’s 2004 Orange Revolution. That story involved a murder plot that implicated his father.

AD

The story is from 2000, and it suggested the younger Derkach could be the “Ukrainian Putin.” At the time, that label — a reference to Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin — was applied to a number of potential successors to President Leonid Kuchma.

Derkach said he was “highly irritated” by the label, according to a transcript of an interview with a local weekly magazine published by the BBC. The source of his irritation wasn’t because it was then a comparison to a strongman; No one knew at the time what Putin would make of his power over the following decade or so. Derkach did not want to be seen as having presidential ambitions.

AD

Kuchma didn’t appear to appreciate the article either. The online journalist Kuchma pegged as being behind it, Georgiy Gongadze, had been very critical of him.

AD

According to the English-language Kyiv Post, later-released recordings that allegedly captured Kuchma and his top aides featured them discussing the article and what to do about Gongadze. One of those aides just happened to be Derkach’s father, Leonid Derkach, who was the head of Ukraine’s security services.

According to Andrew Wilson’s book “Ukraine’s Orange Revolution,” here’s what the recording — which Kuchma claimed was of him but had been doctored — showed them discussing on June 12, 2000:

AD

KUCHMA: This Gongadze, right? LEONID DERKACH: Yes, yes. KUCHMA: You can take care of him? LEONID DERKACH: The time for him to mouth off will come to an end. I’ll crush this f---er.

In later conversations, they spoke more explicitly about organizing Gongadze’s abduction. Another aide said to “take [Gongadze] to Georgia and dump him there,” to which Kuchma responded, “The Chechens should kidnap him and ask for a ransom!” The man identified as Kuchma would return to the Chechen idea in another recording.

AD

Gongadze would soon claim he was being followed, and by September he was killed, his headless body discovered in a forest near Kyiv in November. Soon after, the above recordings, which had been made by an security service officer named Mikola Melnichenko who fled the country, were released.

They sparked protests calling for Kuchma’s ouster. Kuchma would survive it, but his governing coalition collapsed, and he was forced to fire Leonid Derkach. Some consider the protests to have set in motion the Orange Revolution of 2004, in which the demonstrations forced a redo of an allegedly corrupt election won by Kuchma’s chosen successor. The new election resulted in the election of a pro-Western leader, Viktor Yushchenko.

AD

Even Yuschenko’s government would struggle to provide accountability for Gongadze’s killing. In 2005, a Ukrainian parliamentary commission labeled Kuchma, Leonid Derkach and two other senior officials as being the masterminds of the plot. One of the other two, former interior minister Yuri Kravchenko, had been found dead of an alleged suicide earlier that year.

AD

The elder Derkach, a former KGB officer, was never charged with wrongdoing. Now his son, who attended the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow and formerly belonged to a pro-Russian political party, is working with Giuliani to try to affect another major election This one is in the United States, four years after the real Putin interfered in one.

Cory Booker has yet to qualify for the December debate) and reward rich, non-serious candidates who can bump up poll numbers with massive ad buys (e.g., Tom Steyer, who qualified for this month’s debate later on Tuesday). If Democrats cannot come up with a methodology to include the former and exclude the latter, they should have a lower debate threshold or eliminate them entirely. Instead of incoherent events with candidates trying to create viral moments, a series of roundtables with candidates chosen randomly would be more useful before actual voting begins. Thereafter, the top five or six candidates can be invited to debate.

Second, the primary schedule is outrageously imbalanced for a party so reliant on nonwhite voters. Iowa’s and New Hampshire’s locks on the first two contests needs to end, or their importance diminished by adding more diverse states. Iowa and Ohio could be paired, for example, as could New Hampshire and New Jersey. Allowing candidates to gain momentum and eliminate other contenders without ever attracting significant nonwhite support shows a stunning lack of concern for the Democrats’ most important voters. It risks producing a nominee who cannot inspire and turn out the demographic essential for a Democratic victory.

AD

AD

None of this is to say that, with different states in the mix or a different debate set-up, nonwhite candidates would still be in the race. However, as things are currently structured, the party is eliminating candidates that its most loyal voters might have seriously considered while perpetuating candidates who do not have to appeal to those same voters.

No one should expect the remaining candidates to go after Iowa and New Hampshire’s prime positioning just weeks before voting starts. However, the party itself should pledge to revisit the entire nominating process — including the order of primary states. All the candidates on the stage later this month should be pressed as to whether the current system should be perpetuated simply because that is the way it has always been done.

The problem goes beyond the party rules, certainly. The media’s fascination with white, male, working-class voters, the Democrats’ own perceptions of who is “risky” and who is not, and the money advantage some candidates enjoy (because they are self-funded billionaires or because they can move money from previous campaigns to the current race) all play a part. This does not, however, excuse the party from addressing factors that are within its control.

AD

AD

Given that the Democratic nominee will almost certainly be white, we might expect a nonwhite vice presidential pick. Indeed, the days of Democrats running two white males may be over. However, the vice presidency is not a consolation prize. A party dedicated to rooting out racism needs to start with some introspection and recognition that the system as presently structured is neither fair nor helpful in selecting the nominee best situated to win.

He gave no reason at all to regard the evidence gathered by [Rep. Adam B.

Tribe observed, “Fake dirt on Biden was of way more value to Trump than any number of French (or Russian) mistresses. [Turley] has cooked Trump’s French goose.”

Turley made some arguments that frankly do leave one wondering why Republicans thought he would be valuable. For example, Turley acknowledged, “[Trump’s] call was anything but ‘perfect’ and his reference to the Bidens was highly inappropriate.” It was highly “inappropriate” because we do not invite foreign governments to investigate political rivals. The “ask” was in and of itself a serious and impeachable act, especially given Trump’s own statements that he will continue to invite foreign meddling.

AD

AD

Turley also confessed, “The use of military aid for a quid pro quo to investigate one’s political opponent, if proven, can be an impeachable offense.” And we would assume that conditioning a White House meeting desperately needed by an ally could also be an impeachable act. Well, we had multiple witnesses including Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testify to precisely that. Experienced prosecutors, I am quite certain, could get a conviction under the criminal standard, beyond a reasonable doubt.

Even Turley’s primary excuse for not proceeding to impeachment is helpful to Democrats. They cannot, he says, do a thorough investigation without the testimony of key senior officials. Hmm, doesn’t that mean Trump has obstructed Congress in a way Richard Nixon never did? (Turley incorrectly asserted that Nixon defied court orders; in fact, the third of his impeachment articles referenced refusal to respond to subpoenas.)

Turley would prefer Congress wait for the testimony of figures such as former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Conservative lawyer and Trump antagonist George Conway suggests, “In the spirit of compromise, which I think is missing from this age, may I suggest this: Let’s impeach him now but keep investigating, and if we find more evidence, impeach him again.”

AD

AD

That shouldn’t be taken merely as a taunt. Why not impeach Trump now for inviting a foreign power to investigate an individual to further the president’s reelection spots and hold off until we get definitive rulings on witnesses who would bolster an article of impeachment based on the quid pro quo (aid and a meeting for dirt)? Even without additional witnesses, Congress could still impeach on the quid pro quo based on earlier testimony.

In short, Republicans once more appear to be their own worst enemies. “Ultimately, [Turley’s] presence is a reminder of the hypocrisy of the Republican position. He testified before Congress to advocate for Bill Clinton’s impeachment,” former prosecutor Joyce White Vance tells me. “But now, he’s concerned about the country’s future if we impeach a president who endangered our national security to [get] extra help with his campaign from a vulnerable ally.” If Turley is an example of the type of witnesses they think helpful, perhaps Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) should allow them to call many more.

Over the course of 58 calls on six days, Giuliani spent nearly two hours speaking with his associate Lev Parnas; with the Intelligence Committee’s ranking Republican, Devin Nunes (Calif.); with another attorney for Trump, Jay Sekulow; and with officials in the Office of Management and Budget. At times in this period, Giuliani spoke with people identified as connecting to him through switchboards in the White House or the White House Situation Room.

Those are just the calls for which the Intelligence Committee report offers specific details. There’s another instructive flurry of calls in early May as Giuliani was publicly exploring travel to Ukraine to assist his desired investigations. Those calls aren’t broken down with specific time stamps, but the exchanges are nonetheless revelatory.

Giuliani connected with someone at the White House on May 8 for more than six minutes. He also spoke with writer John Solomon, whose articles alleging impropriety in Ukraine were often cited by Giuliani and Trump, for about the same length of time. (Solomon is part of the loosely connected external team of attorneys and allies surrounding Giuliani that we’ve previously documented.) Giuliani separately spoke with Parnas and Derek Harvey, a Nunes staffer. Harvey traveled to Europe with Nunes at the end of last year, during a time the congressman was reported to have met with a former Ukrainian official. He was also in contact with other officials by phone, according to Parnas, and participated in Ukraine-focused meetings at Trump’s hotel in Washington.

The next day, with questions about Giuliani’s trip becoming public, he had lengthy conversations with Solomon and Parnas. After briefly connecting with White House switchboards, he had a four-minute call with someone at the White House. That evening, he had several more calls with Parnas.

On May 10, Giuliani spoke with Parnas several times. He then spoke for half an hour with Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker, who offered Giuliani advice related to his potential trip to the country. After speaking with Volker, Giuliani reached out without success to Kash Patel, a member of the National Security Council and former Nunes staffer. The two eventually connected.

After speaking to Patel, Giuliani talked with someone calling from a number identified in the committee report by the prefix ""-1.” The report doesn’t identify the number further, but it seems likely to represent Trump’s cellphone. Giuliani spoke to the “-1” number for 17 minutes and then to Parnas for an additional 12.

AD

AD

Giuliani canceled his trip later that day.

Where Giuliani’s outreach is best documented in the report is in relation to efforts to oust then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. This had been a focus of Parnas’s even before he worked for Giuliani, mentioned, for example, in the October indictment charging Parnas with campaign finance violations.

On April 1, Solomon published an article alleging improper behavior by former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine — an unfounded allegation that would become central to the Trump-Giuliani pressure campaign.

The report suggests that Giuliani, through Parnas, pressured Solomon to target Yovanovitch.

“Between April 1 and April 7, Mr. Parnas exchanged approximately 16 calls with Mr. Giuliani (longest duration approximately seven minutes) and approximately 10 calls with Mr. Solomon (longest duration approximately nine minutes),"" it reads. On April 7, Solomon wrote an article raising questions about Yovanovitch.

AD

The report documents a number of contacts over the next several days between Giuliani, Parnas, and administration and government officials.

On April 10, for example, Giuliani and Nunes spoke several times over the course of 15 minutes, with Giuliani first calling Nunes and Nunes then returning the call. After sending a text message to an unknown number, Giuliani again called back — and tried a third time without success.

Later that same day, he spoke with Solomon for about five minutes.

On April 12, there were numerous contacts centered on Giuliani. In the morning, Parnas exchanged calls with Victoria Toensing, an attorney for whom Parnas did some translation work and who, with her husband, represented Solomon. That same day, Toensing was retained by two Ukrainians who had served as sources for stories by Solomon.

AD

That same morning, Giuliani was contacted by the “-1” number. Over the course of the days documented in the report, Giuliani spoke with no individual contact more than “-1,” tallying at least 55 minutes. The records also indicate that “-1” always called Giuliani and not vice versa. On several occasions, the connections came after Giuliani called the White House.

He also spoke with someone at the Office of Management and Budget. It’s not clear who, but acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney remains the director of the OMB. (Walt Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, tweeted that “there is no good reason for Rudy Giuliani to be talking to OMB and plenty of bad ones.”)

The afternoon of April 12 involved a lengthy chain of communications, with Giuliani talking to Toensing, Parnas, Sekulow and someone at the OMB. He spoke with “-1” for more than 12 minutes.

AD

Parnas spoke with Solomon and Nunes — and Giuliani, numerous times.

Yovanovitch was ultimately forced out of her position and recalled to the United States. That occurred early in the morning (Kyiv time) on April 25. In the days prior, Giuliani spoke repeatedly with the White House, the OMB and Parnas.

“At 7:14 p.m. Eastern Time on April 25, Mr. Giuliani once again received a call from an unknown '-1′ number, which lasted four minutes and 40 seconds,” the report states. “Minutes later, Mr. Giuliani held a brief 36 second call with Sean Hannity, a Fox News opinion host.”

A few hours later, Trump called into Hannity’s show.

By early August, Giuliani had already met with a senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the administration’s desire for Ukraine to announce politically useful investigations had been explicitly conveyed. Giuliani, Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had been working with Zelensky’s aide to develop a statement announcing the new probes.

AD

AD

On Aug. 8, Giuliani phoned or texted with people in the White House or at the OMB 19 times and had six contacts with the “-1” number, speaking for a bit longer than four minutes.

That call with “-1,” though, didn’t come easy. Giuliani texted the White House. An hour later, “-1” tried to contact Giuliani repeatedly, connecting only briefly if at all. Giuliani contacted the OMB without luck and then the White House multiple times. Only then did the individual identified as “-1” call back so they could speak.

The next day, Guiliani and Volker spoke, and Volker contacted Zelensky’s aide to try to finalize the desired statement.

On Tuesday, hours after the report was released, Nunes was interviewed by Hannity on Fox News. Asked if he’d ever spoken with Parnas, Nunes said he didn’t recall. “I remember that name now because he’s been indicted,” Nunes admitted. “But,” he added, “it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people.”

According to the report, Nunes and this particular random person spoke for more than eight minutes on April 12.

Trump’s defenders suggest that they reflect Trump’s concerns about corruption (the Biden ask) and interference in the 2016 election by Ukraine (the hacking), though Trump’s asks were specifically not about either of those things. They were, instead, about specific theories that are and always have been broadly lacking in evidence — which, of course, is likely why his defenders are looking to recontextualize what Trump asked. The president’s opponents argue that his goal was instead self-serving, to undermine a possible 2020 election opponent and to undercut the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which was a nuisance to Trump for much of his presidency.

It is also understood that Trump declined to finalize a meeting at the White House with Zelensky (something the Ukrainian eagerly sought) and that he blocked the disbursement of congressionally approved aid to the country. Here, the disagreement is on the significance of those acts: Trump’s defenders claim they were either unimportant or a natural extension of Trump’s opposition to foreign assistance; his critics note that each offered points of leverage that could be used to push Ukraine to announce the aforementioned investigations. According to multiple witnesses, that’s in fact what happened.

It is nonetheless up to observers to determine which line of argument to accept, a theoretically necessary underpinning to answering the fundamental question at stake in impeachment: Did Trump behave in a way that necessitates his impeachment?

(We say “theoretically” because the evidence at hand strongly suggests that views of impeachment are driven far more by party identity than by the evidence presented.)

AD

AD

Three months ago, we simply didn’t know enough about what happened to answer that question definitively (or much of anything at all about Trump’s interactions with Ukraine, really). We now know more, though it’s often the case that the various details overlap and obscure one another. It has also been true that there have been gaps in what we know.

With the release of the House impeachment inquiry report Tuesday, a number of significant gaps have been filled. We now know, for example, when precisely the aid to Ukraine was stopped, necessary for understanding how Ukraine was viewing the constant push for Trump’s investigations. We know, too, how discussions of a possible White House meeting were repeatedly conflated with those investigations. We know how that evolved into a specific discussion of a public statement about the investigations and how that then became centered on an interview on CNN.

Using existing information and details from the report, we’ve created the following timeline articulating how those two main tracks — aid to Ukraine and the White House meeting — were or could have been used to pressure Ukraine into announcing the investigations Trump sought.

Three things happened on June 18 that shaped what followed.

AD

AD

One was fairly abstract. On that day, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had an encounter with National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill in which he declared that he was in charge of Ukraine policy. Taken aback, Hill asked him who had made that determination. Trump, Sondland replied, making explicit the secondary channel for Ukraine policy through which the apparent effort to pressure Zelensky would flow.

That same day, the Department of Defense announced $250 million in military aid to Ukraine, aid that had been approved by Congress months earlier. The next day, after having seen media coverage of the announcement, Trump began asking questions about the spending, according to the testimony of Office of Management and Budget official Mark Sandy. Sandy received a request for more information about the aid from a political appointee within OMB.

Meanwhile, the three officials (the “three amigos”) tasked by Trump in late May with leading policy on Ukraine — working with Trump’s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani — met at the Department of Energy. The three, Sondland, then-Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker and then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, discussed a Trump-Zelensky meeting at the White House. They were joined over the phone by acting Ukraine ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., who had begun work the previous day. Volker and Sondland would later inform Taylor that Trump “wanted to hear from Zelensky” before the meeting moved forward, an apparent reference to the investigations.

AD

AD

On June 27, Sondland was more explicit, telling Taylor that Zelensky needed to make clear to Trump that he wasn’t standing in the way of investigations.

The next day, Sondland, Taylor, Perry and Volker spoke with Zelensky by phone. David Holmes, an aide to Taylor in Kyiv, later testified that Zelensky was told that action on a Biden-related investigation was a precondition for a meeting at the White House. This appears to be the first point at which Ukraine was informed that a meeting was conditioned on investigations.

On July 2, Volker and Zelensky spoke again at an event in Toronto. There, Volker again linked a White House meeting to the investigations, referring to them as the “Giuliani factor.”

AD

The next day, July 3, government officials learned that congressional notification of the aid to Ukraine — a step in disbursing the funds — had been placed on hold. This was the first indicator that the aid would not move forward.

AD

A week later, on July 10, a number of members of the administration, including Sondland and Volker, met with Ukrainian officials at the White House. The Ukrainian delegation included Andriy Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, and Oleksandr Danyliuk, a top defense official. During two meetings, Sondland explicitly linked a White House meeting to the desired investigations, frustrating Hill and others present.

The halt to aid was formalized on July 12, according to the House report. It was announced broadly within the administration during a conference call on July 18, which is when staffers in Kyiv first learned about it. Over the rest of the month, there were a number of meetings in which stakeholders sought to move the aid forward, without success. When the Defense Department argued that it would need to begin disbursing funds by Aug. 6 to get them out the door by the end of the fiscal year, a deadline for the review (which OMB cited as the cause of the halt) was set for Aug. 6. That deadline, and several others, were missed.

AD

On July 19, Volker, Giuliani and Giuliani’s associate Lev Parnas had breakfast at Trump’s hotel in Washington. Volker later reported back to Sondland and Taylor that it was critical “for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation — and address any specific personnel issues — if there are any” in a conversation with Trump. Sondland spoke with Zelensky and conveyed that message, later reporting back on the conversation and its contents to Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

AD

The next day, Taylor had a conversation with Danyliuk in which the Ukrainian grumbled about his country being made into a pawn for the 2020 election.

Trump and Zelensky spoke for the first time on July 25. Trump asked Zelensky for the two investigations he sought, identifying the one related to the DNC hacking as being a favor he was requesting of Ukraine after Zelensky mentioned wanting to purchase military equipment. Before the call, Trump and Sondland spoke, with Sondland then asking Volker to send a message to Zelensky’s team: You’ll get the meeting if you agree to the probes. Zelensky agreed to the probes, and, afterward, Trump extended an invitation to the White House.

AD

That afternoon, staffers at the Defense Department received emails indicating that both Congress and Ukraine were to some extent aware of the hold on military aid. A former deputy foreign minister in Zelensky’s government told the New York Times this week that she knew with certainty by July 30. This is the clearest indication to date of when Ukraine knew about the aid freeze.

AD

The next day, July 26, Sondland and Volker held a number of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky and Yermak. Sondland testified that he believed he raised the investigations with Yermak in a one-on-one conversation. Later, he would call Trump and assure the president that the investigations were moving forward.

After their breakfast at Trump’s hotel, Volker had introduced Yermak to Giuliani, and the two of them set up a meeting in Madrid on Aug. 2. There, a new strategy emerged.

AD

“The Madrid meeting set off a ‘series of discussions’ among Mr. Giuliani, Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Sondland,” the report states, “about the need for President Zelensky to issue a public statement about the investigations into Burisma”— the company for which Biden’s son worked in Ukraine — “and the 2016 election conspiracy theory to secure a White House meeting with President Trump.”

AD

That desired statement became the focus of discussion between Sondland, Volker, Giuliani and Yermak for the early part of August. On Aug. 9, Sondland felt they were close, with Trump willing to set a date for the meeting because he really wanted the “deliverable” — that statement about the probes.

The next day, Aug. 10, Yermak proposed releasing the statement only after the date for a White House meeting was set, recognizing the inherent quid pro quo. It didn’t work. He sent a draft statement on Aug. 12, but it didn’t include specific mentions of the investigations Trump wanted to see.

Sondland, Volker and Giuliani agreed on revisions that included specific references to those probes and sent them to Yermak on Aug. 13. Yermak was hesitant, asking if there had been a formal request for an investigation made by the U.S. government. There hadn’t.

On Aug. 17, the group confirmed that they were still seeking a statement including the two probes. Ultimately, though, the statement was tabled, because Ukrainian officials were worried that including the specific probes would make it look as though they were playing politics. But Volker worried that Giuliani would consider the language too weak if the probes weren’t included. That Zelensky was planning to replace the prosecutor general added an additional layer of complication.

On Aug. 22, Sondland suggested to Pompeo that Trump and Zelensky meet when both were in Poland for a planned event the following month. Zelensky, he hoped, could tell Trump that he’d address the issue when the new team was in place, a conversation that he hoped could break “the logjam” with Zelensky’s team. Trump ended up not going because of Hurricane Dorian.

In the meantime, though, word of the halt in aid became public with a Politico article on Aug. 28. Yermak contacted Volker and Taylor on Aug. 29. As the State Department’s Catherine Croft testified, there was no reason for Ukraine to make the halt public, as it would send a message that U.S. support was softening. Once it was made public otherwise, the calculus apparently changed. That same day, Taylor sent a memo to Pompeo objecting to the halt in aid, a halt that he would soon connect to the desired investigations.

In Poland on Sept. 1, Sondland met with Yermak. Having come to the conclusion (without prompting, he testified) that aid was contingent on the desired investigations, he told Yermak that “the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.” Taylor, getting wind of the conversation, raised concerns with Sondland.

Holmes testified that Sondland’s assertion was probably redundant. Ukraine, having been pushed for months to announce new investigations and aware that aid was being withheld for no publicly stated reason, would independently have come to the same conclusion that Sondland did.

On Sept. 5, The Washington Post editorial board reported that it had learned that aid was being withheld to pressure Ukraine into launching an investigation focused on Biden.

Two days later, on Sept. 7, Trump and Sondland spoke, with the president denying a quid pro quo on aid but insisting that Zelensky announce the investigations. After speaking with Trump, Sondland “promptly” spoke to Zelensky, according to the report, at which point Zelensky agreed to announce the probes — in an interview with CNN later in the month.

On Sept. 9, Taylor again expressed concerns about tying aid to the announcement of new investigations. Sondland denied any quid pro quo, something he later testified was simply a recitation of what Trump had claimed. That same day, House Democrats announced an investigation into Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine and the hold on aid. On Sept. 11, Trump released the aid.

Ukraine appeared to still be planning to move forward with the CNN interview, however, despite concerns expressed by Taylor and others. On Sept. 13, Zelensky met with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, who was going to conduct the interview; as of then, it was still on. It was only several days later, on Sept. 18 or 19, that the interview was canceled.

By then, there was broad attention being paid to what happened in Ukraine. Within days, the administration released the rough transcript of the July 25 call in an effort to show that Trump had behaved properly and, in the president’s phrasing, that there had been no quid pro quo at stake."

A signal that impeachment will include Mueller?

The House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearings focused almost exclusively on Ukraine. That was the new information, after all, and that’s what the witnesses could speak to.

But at the start of Wednesday’s hearing, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) seemed to indicate he was inclined to include something else in the impeachment articles: the obstruction-of-justice portions of the Mueller investigation.

AD

AD

Nadler’s opening statement accused Trump of obstructing both the Ukraine probe and the Russia investigation, and it included plenty on the latter, in a way that suggests it was a calculated choice.

“When his own Justice Department tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws,” Nadler said of the Russia probe, “President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to obstruct the investigation, including ignoring subpoenas, ordering the creation of false records, and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses. Then, as now, this administration’s level of obstruction is without precedent.”

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III opted not to decide whether Trump had obstructed justice, given Justice Department guidelines that say a sitting president can’t be indicted. But there were five instances in which he suggested there was substantial evidence to support all three criteria for an obstruction charge.

AD

AD

The Washington Post’s Rachael Bade has written about how Democrats were quietly talking about including Mueller in the impeachment articles. Of course, just because Nadler may think that should be included doesn’t mean his fellow Democrats will agree.

2. Professor Pamela Karlan, center stage

Before the hearing began, the committee’s ranking Republican, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), was officially passed over for a Senate appointment by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who instead picked business executive Kelly Loeffler. Trump had wanted Collins, a fierce defender of the president, to get the seat.

And shortly thereafter, Collins was upbraided by one of the witnesses.

AD

Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan noted she had worked with some of the Republicans on the committee, and then addressed Collins directly. She took exception to Collins suggesting the hearings weren’t about the underlying facts and were instead about a political vendetta.

AD

“And here, Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing, because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts,” Karlan said. “So I’m insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor, I don’t care about those facts.”

It was a level of combativeness that you rarely see from a witness. And it made Karlan an early focal point of this hearing.

AD

Later on, Karlan made a pointed comment about the powers the Constitution delegates to a president, noting that a key restriction was on titles of nobility.

“So while the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,” she said, drawing some laughter.

White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham charged that Karlan was using “a teenage boy who has nothing to do with this joke of a hearing (and deserves privacy) as a punchline.” First lady Melania Trump also weighed in.

AD

A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) December 4, 2019

Karlan apologized later in the hearing. “I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the president’s son,” she said. “It was wrong of me to do that.” She added that she wished Trump would also apologize for the things he’s done wrong.

AD

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) used his time to criticize the comment as well. And he referred to past comments from Karlan in which she said liberals live closer together and that very conservative people tended to spread out, “perhaps because even they don’t want to be around themselves.” Gaetz suggested it showed Karlan’s contempt for conservatives; Karlan said she was merely making a point about how conservatives generally don’t want to live in crowded areas, even if their neighbors are like-minded.

Karlan once told The Washington Post that she would like to have been a Supreme Court justice — “but not enough to have trimmed my sails for half a lifetime.” That sensibility was certainly on display Wednesday.

AD

3. A unique GOP witness — who won’t defend Trump the man

The GOP’s lone witness at the table on Wednesday, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, is a veteran of these hearings. As he noted in his opening statement, he also testified at President Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings.

AD

And Turley clearly came prepared. His opening statement numbered 53 pages — significantly longer than the other witnesses’ — and contained extensive, detailed footnotes.

Perhaps his strongest argument came at the top, when he said that he has very little regard for Trump, even as he doesn’t believe Trump should be impeached.

“First, I am not a supporter of President Trump. I voted against him in 2016 and I have previously voted for Presidents Clinton and Obama,” Turley said in his written statement. “Second, I have been highly critical of President Trump, his policies and his rhetoric, in dozens of columns. Third, I have repeatedly criticized his raising of the investigation of the Hunter Biden matter with the Ukrainian president.”

AD

AD

Turley even said, contradicting Trump, that Trump’s July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky “was anything but perfect.” He added in his written statement that Trump’s “reference to the Bidens was highly inappropriate.” He even admitted the House had a legitimate reason to investigate the Ukraine situation. But he said impeachment wasn’t warranted based on current evidence.

Turley’s advocacy for a president he doesn’t support was a noted contrast to the other three witnesses, all of whom, as the White House quickly noted, had publicly disparaged Trump in the past. Some suggested Democrats should have invited witnesses who didn’t appear so ideologically opposed to Trump.

1. Strong agree.

2. Not that it would've changed any votes...

3. But that's not the point of any of this.

4. Tactics + Strategy. If the Dems care about long-term norms or a clearly better framing for all their 2020 anxiety, they should have invited more @chkbal folks in addition. — Jed Shugerman (@jedshug) December 4, 2019

Turley argued in his briefer verbal statement that impeachment was not a remedy for political anger, nor was it likely to reduce it.

AD

AD

“I get it: You’re mad,” Turley said. “The president’s mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad. And Luna is a goldendoodle, and they don’t get mad.”

He added: “So we’re all mad. Where’s that taken us? Will [a] slipshod impeachment make us less mad, or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?”

Turley did give Democrats some arguments, though, including when he suggested if a Ukraine quid pro quo was directly tied to Trump, it could be impeachable.

“In fact, non-crimes have been part of past impeachments; it’s just that they’ve never gone up alone or primarily as the basis of impeachment,” Turley said. “That’s the problem here. If you prove a quid pro quo, then you might have an impeachable offense.”

AD

4. A curious argument against impeaching Trump

One argument Turley kept coming back to seemed to be one that Republicans will run with, even though it had some key flaws. He repeatedly suggested that this impeachment process would set a record for speed.

“Why do you want to set the record for the fastest impeachment?” he asked the Democrats on the panel. “Fast is not good for impeachment.”

The first issue with this is we’ve had only two impeachments — Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson — so it’s not like there’s a lot to compare it to.

But the second is that it doesn’t appear to be correct.

It has been 71 days since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that the House would begin impeachment proceedings. In the case of Bill Clinton, it was 75 days between the House authorizing the impeachment inquiry and actually impeaching Clinton. There were process differences that make them less directly comparable: The investigative work for Clinton’s impeachment was already done by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, which allowed for the actual impeachment process to move more quickly. And this time, the House waited a month before voting on formalizing the inquiry, though depositions began very quickly after Pelosi’s announcement.

The Johnson example is worse for Turley’s comparison. Johnson was actually impeached just three days after committing the offense for which he was impeached — the removal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Johnson removed Stanton on Feb. 21, 1868; he was impeached on Feb. 24; and then the House decided on the actual impeachment articles. It was sent to the Senate by March 4 — less than two weeks after the offense for which Johnson was impeached.

The more valid part of Turley’s argument was that the impeachment hearing is moving faster than the courts, which have become involved in settling the disputes between Congress and the White House. House investigators subpoenaed many executive branch officials and documents, and the White House blocked officials from testifying and didn’t turn over the requested documents, so Congress sued.

Turley pointed out that President Nixon resigned after a Supreme Court decision that found he had to turn over evidence. Turley pointed out that it lent legitimacy that two branches of government trumped the executive.

The issues with it notwithstanding, Republicans like Collins seized on Turley’s argument that the impeachment process is rushed.

Prof. Turley: “Proceeding to a vote on this incomplete record is a dangerous precedent to set for this country. Removing a sitting President is not supposed to be easy or fast. It is meant to be thorough and complete. This is neither.” — Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) December 4, 2019

5. Nadler under fire

Republicans seem to believe they could make an example of Nadler and use him to argue that this process isn’t fair.

From the outset, they made clear part of their goal Wednesday was to ruffle Nadler. Nadler earned criticism for his committee’s handling of a September hearing with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and Pelosi’s decision to begin the proceedings in the Intelligence Committee, chaired by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), wasn’t exactly a vote of confidence in Nadler.

Shortly after Nadler’s opening statement, Republicans began peppering him with parliamentary inquiries and made a motion to compel Schiff to testify. Democrats moved to table the motion, and Republicans forced a vote on it. They also asked whether the federal rules of evidence could be enforced in the hearing.

When the first witness, Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, began speaking, Republicans repeatedly asked to be recognized for motions. Nadler said such motions had to wait until after the witnesses’ opening statements. But they kept trying.

When Feldman finished, Republicans moved to postpone the hearing. Democrats again objected, and Republicans forced another roll-call vote."

Giuliani tweeted that U.S. assistance to Ukraine on anti-corruption reforms could face a “major obstacle” until the “conversation about corruption in Ukraine” is resolved. Giuliani alleged “compelling” evidence of criminal misdeeds by Biden, but gave no specifics.

His presence in Ukraine also advances the efforts of Trump allies to create an alternative narrative in the rapidly moving impeachment investigation — tapping some of Ukraine’s most controversial figures who have spread theories of corruption and impropriety around Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

The New York Times, which first reported Giuliani’s travels, said he had meetings in Budapest and Kyiv this week to meet current and former Ukrainian officials for a documentary.

AD

Derkach noted that their meeting was filmed by “some kind of American television company” but offered no further details.

“Rudolph Giuliani has arrived in Kyiv. We met up immediately to discuss the establishment of the Friends of Ukraine STOP Corruption interparliamentary group,” Derkach said in a Facebook post.

AD

Derkach, an independent lawmaker who was formerly a member of a pro-Russian party in parliament, went to the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow. He is the son of a KGB officer who later served as head of Ukrainian intelligence.

Derkach wrote that Giuliani could help bring experts, journalists and analysts to investigate corruption in Ukraine and “benefit strategic relations between Kyiv and the United States.”

AD

Derkach said he had sent letters Tuesday to key Republicans including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.) and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, seeking their participation.

He said their involvement would help expose the ineffective use of U.S. tax dollars by Ukrainian authorities.

“We sent our proposal. We’re waiting for a reaction, an answer. We’re waiting to see how much this is something that the congressmen and senators are in need of. If they want to work together, we’re ready,” Derkach said.

AD

Derkach said he handed Giuliani documents on allegations relating to inefficient expenditure of U.S. government money on projects in Ukraine and other matters.

AD

The documents do not mention the Bidens. But Derkach makes reference to the energy company Burisma, which had Hunter Biden as a board member.

Right-wing network One America News announced Tuesday it was conducting a “special investigation” with Giuliani, flying three Ukrainian officials to the United States and “debunking Schiff’s impeachment narrative.”

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) chaired the Intelligence Committee that handed down a report concluding that Trump sought to undermine U.S. democracy and endangered national security.

Derkach did not state whether the TV crew with Giuliani was from One America News.

Derkach and another parliamentary deputy, Oleksandr Dubinsky, called a news conference in Kyiv last month announcing plans to launch an investigative committee of the Ukrainian parliament, claiming corruption by top Ukrainian political figures and Burisma.

AD

AD

The company is at the heart of the impeachment investigation, with allegations Trump withheld military aid to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open corruption investigations that could have damaged Joe Biden, a potential rival in next year’s presidential election.

Analysts have dismissed Derkach as spreading disinformation to support the theory, being promoted by Trump allies, that Biden sought the dismissal of a former Ukraine prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, because he wanted to protect his son.

Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said in October that he would carry out an audit to review the handling of all previous cases involving Burisma.

AD

No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has emerged, and European powers were also seeking Shokin’s dismissal, seeing him as corrupt and an obstacle to reform.

AD

Derkach has previously led calls to investigate the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. In 2017, he wrote a letter to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, demanding an investigation into alleged interference in the elections by Ukrainian officials to hamper Trump’s campaign, claiming this had “seriously damaged Ukraine-American relations.”

The July 24, 2017, letter came one day before Trump called on the U.S. attorney general’s office in a tweet to investigate “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage the Trump campaign.”

AD

Derkach and Dubinsky, however, seem to be experiencing difficulty attracting the support of 150 members of parliament — the number required to form the investigative group.

Derkach and Dubinsky have “zero” chance of forming an investigative committee, said one parliamentarian Thursday, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the issue’s sensitivity.

AD

Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and analyst on corruption in Russia and Ukraine, tweeted last month that Derkach and others were spreading “lies” on behalf of Trump and Giuliani.

“Stay away from them! All lies!” he wrote.

He tweeted Wednesday that Giuliani “has chosen Ukrainian interlocutors who are criminals & NEVER say anything true.”

AD

On Tuesday, Giuliani met again with another key figure, former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko, in Budapest, according to the New York Times. Giuliani had met previously with Lutsenko, who also has pushed the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in 2016 elections.

The New York Times reported Giuliani was seeking other meetings with two former prosecutors, Shokin and Kostiantyn Kulyk.

Ukrainian anti-corruption campaigner Daria Kaleniuk, director of the nonprofit Anti-

Corruption Action Center, described Derkach on Twitter as having associations with Ukrainian security services and an allegedly corrupt pharmaceutical firm. She noted that he opposed a system of electronic declaration of parliamentarians’ assets in 2015, designed to clean up endemic Ukrainian corruption.

The Investigations

BRING IT ON: That seems to be the White House's new attitude now that it's all but certain the House will vote to impeach President Trump.

The White House is encouraging Republicans to aggressively defend the president at what's sure to be a rough and tumble impeachment trial in the Senate — and even bring in live witnesses who could counter inevitable accusations Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rivals.

If you can't beat it, join it: ""This isn't going anywhere,"" a source close to the White House working on impeachment told Power Up. ""So [Trump's] leaning fully into it.""

Strategy preview: GOP senators had a private lunch yesterday with White House officials, who briefed senators on the desired parameters for an impeachment trial. ""The president wants his case made fully in the Senate,"" the White House director of legislative affairs, Eric Ueland, said after the lunch, per our colleagues Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian.

The plan for live witnesses is a departure from ""videotaped depositions that were entered into evidence during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999,"" our colleagues write.

Key: “In this instance, we believe very strongly — given the fatally flawed process in the House — that if they were to elect against our better advice [and] send over impeachment to the Senate, that we need witnesses as part of our trial and a full defense of the president on the facts,” Ueland said.

“In this instance, we believe very strongly — given the fatally flawed process in the House — that if they were to elect against our better advice [and] send over impeachment to the Senate, that we need witnesses as part of our trial and a full defense of the president on the facts,” Ueland said. Also briefing senators: White House counsel Pat Cipollone. And two officials who recently joined the White House to steer the response to the inquiry: Pam Bondi, former attorney general of Florida, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman.

Sources familiar with the White House's thinking on impeachment dismissed the current focus in Washington on which Senate Republicans might break with Trump.

""Everyone is focused on defections with Republicans but the more realistic outcome is that there are defections on the Democratic side,"" one source told Power Up, pointing to the most vulnerable Senate Democrats such as Doug Jones (Ala.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va).

Even Democrats are not optimistic about the odds Trump will be convicted: ""There will probably be less votes to impeach Trump in a trial than there was for Bill Clinton,"" a Democratic lawmaker told us.

There's also a political benefit: A public trial with headline-grabbing witnesses puts Trump exactly where he wants to be -- occupying valuable media real estate coveted by the Democrats running for president as they head into the first in the nation's presidential primaries early next year.

Fighting with the media and Democrats ""on the front page of every newspaper for the next few months guaranteed,"" a senior Republican aide on the Hill told us.

Key details are still murky, however: White House officials did not specify which witnesses should be called nor specifics of ""how they would like the trial to be structured,"" our colleagues write. ""Republican senators acknowledged they would not know much about how the trial would unfold until the House drafted articles of impeachment and voted on them.""

Mark your calendars (or not): The Senate floor schedule just released for 2020 doesn’t start until Feb. 1.

The Senate floor schedule just released for 2020 doesn’t start until Feb. 1. “The only thing I know for sure is that nobody knows what we’re doing in January yet,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told them.

EVERYONE GETS A PEP RALLY: Trump could be impeached by the House before Christmas, if the aggressive schedule House Democrats are planning is any indication. Before an 8½ -hour public Judiciary Committee hearing, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) made that clear, even though they haven't announced any firm decision or timeline. From our Post team:

""Are you ready?' Pelosi asked her colleagues, after describing constitutional circumstances posed by Trump’s alleged abuse of power surrounding his Ukraine dealings, as well as his subsequent decision to stonewall the House investigation into the matter.""

after describing constitutional circumstances posed by Trump’s alleged abuse of power surrounding his Ukraine dealings, as well as his subsequent decision to stonewall the House investigation into the matter."" ""The caucus, according to multiple members who attended, erupted with shouts of approval.""

Expect to hear more from Pelosi today:

The Speaker’s Office has just announced the following: Speaker Pelosi will deliver a statement today, Thursday, December 5, at 9:00 a.m. E.T. on the status of the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry. — Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) December 5, 2019

Vice President Mike Pence gave House Republicans their own pep talk, encouraging them to ""turn up the heat"" on Democrats.

""The vice president was clear that he was proud of how the House Republicans have stood together on the impeachment inquiry but wanted to remind us that in our discussions back home, we need to talk about things that are not happening because House Democrats are consumed with impeaching the president,” Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) told our colleagues. He pointed to legislation to curb prescription drug costs and a pending trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.

On The Hill

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT MARATHON HEARING: ""After a more than eight-hour hearing with four constitutional scholars, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said [Trump’s] conduct with Ukraine rose to an impeachable offense,"" our colleagues Colby Itkowitz, Felicia Sonmez and John Wagner report.

From a Democrat's perspective: ""I’m disappointed with our Republican colleagues who spent all day talking about process -- and it’s because they’ve been unwilling to confront the grave misconduct of Trump,"" Judiciary member David Ciccilline (D-R.I.) told Power Up after the hearing.

""They complained about absence of witnesses? Well the single greatest cause of that has been from the president, who has been obstructing Congress,"" he added. ""I think the American people are seeing right through this.""

Back to (law) school: Our colleagues Dan Zak and Ben Terris described the atmosphere in the hearing room. ""And now, here come the academics: Four of them, trailing their curricula vitae like billowing robes, ready to act as counsel for the Founding Fathers, who remain very dead but continue to haunt us. What would the founders think of us? What would they think of [Trump], and the effort to impeach him? To find out, the House Committee on the Judiciary held a sort of seance.""

“Some day we will no longer be alive, and we’ll go wherever it is we go — the good place or the other place,” said one of the Democrats’ witnesses, Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School. “And, you know, we may meet there [James] Madison and [Alexander] Hamilton, and they will ask us: ‘When the president of the United States acted to corrupt the structure of the republic, what did you do?’ ”

The hearing offered a hint at what possible impeachment articles might include: ""Nadler’s opening statement accused Trump of obstructing both the Ukraine probe and the Russia investigation, and it included plenty on the latter, in a way that suggests it was a calculated choice,"" our colleague Aaron Blake reports.

What the GOP is talking about: ""In one of the more heated moments of the day, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) confronted Stanford University law professor Pamela Karlan for invoking Trump’s youngest son Barron when asserting that there are limits to Trump’s power,"" Politico's Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio report.

What happened: Karlan when asked what the difference between a king and a president were quipped, ""While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,” she said before later apologizing.

Karlan when asked what the difference between a king and a president were quipped, ""While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,” she said before later apologizing. The White House seized on the moment: Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed Karlan's joke, and first lady Melania Trump made a rare public and political statement about it, too.

What the Judiciary panel is like: Our colleagues Daniela Santamariña, Kate Rabinowitz and Kevin Uhrmacher illustrated what the committee that will lead this phase of the impeachment inquiry.

What's next?: For now, the Judiciary panel does not has any more public hearings scheduled. But that could change should lawmakers still want a floor vote by the end of the year.

Our colleagues have a helpful breakdown on where this could go from here:

Should the Judiciary Committee write and approve articles, there would then be a floor vote on each article.

The magic number in the House could be 216, whether or not Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calf.) resigns, per Paul Kane.

If articles pass the House, we would move to a Senate trial:

In the Agencies

ANOTHER BARR-RELATED SCOOP: ""The prosecutor handpicked by Attorney General William P. Barr to scrutinize how U.S. agencies investigated [Trump’s] 2016 campaign said he could not offer evidence to the Justice Department’s inspector general to support the suspicions of some conservatives that the case was a setup by American intelligence, people familiar with the matter said,"" our colleagues Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report.

More details: ""Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s office contacted U.S. Attorney John Durham, the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, the people said,"" our colleagues write. ""Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign, the people said.""

""Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s office contacted U.S. Attorney John Durham, the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, the people said,"" our colleagues write. ""Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign, the people said."" But there is no evidence the professor was an asset: The professor in question is Joseph Mifsud, who told Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos of possible dirt on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos was later overheard talking about this by an Australian diplomat who tipped off U.S. officials, which started what eventually became the Mueller probe.

This is could rebut conservative doubts ""that Horowitz might be blessing the FBI’s Russia investigation prematurely and that Durham could potentially find more, particularly with regard to the Maltese professor,"" our colleagues write. Barr has expressed these feelings to associates in recent weeks.

It also undermines a potentially GOP counter-theory: Trump allies and even some lawmakers have long questioned the origin story of the Mueller probe and hinted, if not, outright stated that Papadopoulos and others may have been set up. Part of this theory rests on Mifsud, a shadowy figure, being more than just a professor.

But we'll know a lot more soon: Horowitz's report is expected to be published on Monday, and he will testify in front lawmakers just days later.

Hale’s statement’s echoed last month’s testimony by Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser on Russia, who dismissed claims of Ukrainian interference as “a fictional narrative” spun by Russian intelligence.

Republicans’ promotion of Trump’s Ukraine conspiracy theory is the latest example of their capitulation to him and of the GOP’s rapid transformation on Russia — from a party that for decades celebrated its hawkish stance toward the Kremlin to one that is reluctant to take a hard line and risk Trump’s wrath.

For some seasoned Republican foreign policy voices, the GOP’s refusal to back away from Trump’s position on supposed interference by Ukraine risks erasing values forged in the Cold War and defined for a generation by President Ronald Reagan’s prescient call for the Berlin Wall to come down.

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” said Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who has advised top Republicans on global affairs, said “it’s entirely a reflection of the political reality of where we are and the gravitational pull of President Trump and his singular hold over the Republican political establishment. … They don’t just ignore the Democrats but embrace alternative theories.”

There is also a growing view inside the GOP that the party’s core voters will not revolt if the party takes a softer position on Russia — a calculation backed by polling during Trump’s presidency. Gallup’s surveys, for instance, show that an expanding group of Republicans — 40 percent in July 2018 — now says Russia is a U.S. ally or is friendly, up from 22 percent in 2014, while “25 percent of Democrats say the same, little changed from 2014.”

“The base supports the president, and every Republican knows that — and they don’t think that this issue will rise high on the list of issues that matter to voters when they go to the polls,” said Republican consultant Michael Steel, who worked forJohn A. Boehner (R-Ohio) when Boehner was House speaker. “Whether what some of them are saying on Ukraine is consciously intellectually dishonest or not, they think the election will turn on jobs and the economy, not on Russia.”

Trump’s claims on Ukraine are part of the long list of incendiary conspiracy theories he has championed while paying little to no political cost within his own party, including questioning former president Barack Obama’s birthplace and patriotism, linking the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to John F. Kennedy’s assassination and alleging that Trump Tower was wiretapped during the 2016 campaign.

Many Senate Republicans who spoke with reporters around their weekly lunch Tuesday argued that the way Ukrainian officials spoke about the 2016 presidential campaign constituted interference on par with Russian interference — a position that is directly at odds with the conclusion of U.S. intelligence officials.

AD

AD

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he saw evidence of Ukrainian “cheerleading” for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 that was “not insignificant.”

Even Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has drawn praise for his emphasis on bipartisan investigations, nodded this week toward Trump’s belief that Ukraine interfered.

“There’s no difference in the way Russia put their feet, early on, on the scale — being for one candidate and everybody called it meddling — and how the Ukrainian officials did it,” Burr said Tuesday.

Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), a vocal Trump ally, was among the first key lawmakers to state that they believed Ukraine’s conduct in 2016 was all but equivalent to Russian interference. But he has strained at times in doing so, pinballing from touting the claim to somewhat recanting to touting it again during a Sunday television interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where he claimed that Ukraine’s former president, Petro Poroshenko, “actively worked for Secretary Clinton” in 2016.

AD

AD

The inchoate and unproved nature of the Republican case against Ukraine has not prevented several GOP leaders from taking up the cause.

Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of GOP leadership who is close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), picked up directly on Kennedy’s argument this week, saying that Kennedy “has pointed out I think eight different stories” to show Ukraine and Russia “both meddled.”

Barrasso declined to elaborate on whether there was an equivalence between Russia’s covert 2016 election interference campaign and public statements made at the time by Ukrainian officials critical of Trump, who during the 2016 campaign had expressed a disdain for NATO and an interest in recognizing Crimea as Russia’s following the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian territory.

AD

When asked to define what he understood “meddling” to be, Barrasso said, “I’m not going to get in the middle of a fight that you want to have picked.”

AD

Such assessments appeared to confound some members of the GOP who serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Hale testified Tuesday that he was not aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) — the party’s 2012 presidential nominee and the informal standard-bearer for GOP hawks — was one of the few Republican lawmakers who stood by the assessment of U.S. officials. Romney famously declared in 2012 that Russia “is, without question, our number one geopolitical foe.”

AD

“I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” Romney told reporters Tuesday.

Romney added later, “Leaders of the countries are pulling for one candidate or another, that’s to be expected, but there’s a big difference between pulling for someone, hoping someone wins in the American election and interfering in the way Russia did.”

AD

Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) — who like Romney sits on the Foreign Relations Committee — said Tuesday that while “Russia meddled in the election,” he was “not aware of” evidence that Ukraine did.

AD

McConnell, meanwhile, declined to comment on the ongoing GOP debate over Ukraine and interference in the 2016 election.

“The intelligence committees have the ability to look at any of these suggestions,” he said at a news conference. “My view is that’s something for Senate Intelligence to take a look at it, and I don’t have a particular reaction to it.”

In other influential gathering places on the right, conservative media figures, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have been at the forefront of right-wing claims that Russian interference has been overstated by U.S. officials and the national political establishment, fueling the congressional Republican push to shrug off talk about Russian hostility.

AD

“It never happened. There was no collusion. Russia didn’t hack our democracy,” Carlson wrote on Fox News’s website Tuesday. “The whole thing was a talking point, a ludicrous talking point, invented by the Hillary Clinton campaign on or about November 9th, 2016 to explain their unexpected defeat in the last presidential election.”

That column by Carlson came hours after he said on his Monday broadcast that “I think we should probably take the side of Russia, if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine.”

Hill testified last month that while serving in the Trump White House and in the months since she left, she refused to be “part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine — not Russia — attacked us in 2016.”

“These fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes,” Hill said.

Putin has appeared to be amused by the turn of events in the United States. Speaking in Moscow last month, he said, “Thank God no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore. Now, they’re accusing Ukraine.”

Senate Democrats expressed alarm Tuesday as the Republicans chimed in along those lines; Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said in a floor speech that “by spreading the false and unsupported narrative that Ukraine — not just [Russian President Vladimir] Putin — was responsible for interfering in the 2016 elections, Republicans are endangering our democracy and empowering Vladimir Putin, at the same time.”

“Even wondering aloud about the debunked Ukrainian interference theory helps Putin muddy the waters and deflect the blame away from his country, which our intelligence services have all agreed — I think it’s seventeen of them — that he interfered in the election. He’s trying to create a diversion, and our Republican colleagues are going along,” Schumer said.

Veteran Democratic strategists see a possible opening for the party’s eventual nominee to win over some hawkish Republicans and independents who are wary of the Republican drift on Russia.

Throughout the campaign season, most Democratic presidential candidates have spoken sharply of Russia, calling out its election interference and defending what former vice president Joe Biden has called the “liberal international order.”

“The responsible position is to recognize that Russia is a force one has to reckon with, but certainly not a force to embrace,” said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama. “Among ‘Never Trump’ Republicans, you could see it as a huge, animating factor next year because they tend to be neocons who are strongly anti-Russia.”

Axelrod added that the GOP shift on Russia is among a number of “stunning Republican changes, from being the free-trade party to the tariff party, from a pro-immigration party to anti-immigration” that could have an impact on next year’s election.

But Democrats have been grappling with figures within their ranks whose foreign-policy rhetoric is skeptical of the political establishment and has elements of Trump’s worldview, highlighting that the party’s positioning is far from universally hawkish and that Democrats face their own turbulence on foreign policy.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a presidential candidate, has argued in favor of a noninterventionist U.S. foreign policy in Syria and elsewhere and has been favorably covered by the Kremlin-backed news agency RT. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton claimed in October that Gabbard was the “favorite of the Russians,” drawing quick criticism from Gabbard."

A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white.

Democratic contenders who kicked off their campaigns promising to break gender barriers, or rally the rainbow coalition of Barack Obama, instead found themselves fighting concerns that the country’s lingering racism or sexism could help reelect Trump.

AD

“I do think this is a real moment of reckoning in the party,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, a veteran of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign who now works for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, most of whose members are immigrants or women of color. “We had the most diverse field in history, and there is an argument that was soundly rejected by voters.”

AD

To a striking degree, Democratic voters appear to be adopting the role of pundits, choosing candidates based on how they believe other voters will act rather than their own preferences, interviews with voters shows.

Still, the nomination is far from settled. Obama trailed Clinton in the polls in late 2007 before going on to win the nomination, and past nominees such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004 came back from polling deficits the preceding fall. But neither of those candidates was excluded from the party’s debates because of low polling, a prospect that has hit some women and nonwhite candidates particularly hard this year.

Currently, six white candidates, including two women and billionaire financier Tom Steyer, have qualified for the December debate. Two others, businessman Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are of Asian descent, need one more poll at 4 percent to qualify. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who is black, and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, who is Latino, are not likely to make the cut. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black and who entered the race last month, also is not expected to make the stage.

AD

“We have more billionaires onstage than black people,” said former South Carolina state representative Bakari Sellers, who had endorsed Harris. “The Republican top six candidates at this time in 2016 was more diverse than our top six candidates.”

The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black.

AD

Sellers cautioned against buying into fears that Trump would more easily beat a minority candidate. “Trump is an interesting phenomenon: He has actually put the Democratic Party in what I feel is an untenable position by believing we need a white candidate to win,” he said.

Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who had endorsed Harris, said journalists and others were disproportionately critical of the senator’s campaign.

AD

“I think we as a party give lip service to diversity, but we really care very little about it,” Fudge said. “I would say for the highest-ranking elected black woman in the country to have gotten the kind of dismissal by so many people, I think is nothing more than misogynistic, as well as in some respects quite racist.”

AD

Strategists and candidates blame the struggles of female and minority candidates on a variety of factors. The initial fury of the women’s marches that greeted Trump’s arrival in Washington has faded, they say. Individual weaknesses were shown by candidates like Harris, who struggled to articulate a consistent campaign message, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), who ran an unabashed women-focused campaign that failed to connect with voters.

Others point to media coverage that they say focused on white working-class male voters and suggested the party’s overriding challenge was to win them back. Candidates like Harris, Castro and Booker, in contrast, have run explicitly on their promise to turn out more urban voters in the general election.

AD

“There is a narrative that has developed in the media about who can best take on Donald Trump, about this moderate working-class white voter in the Midwest,” Castro said in an interview. “I don’t recall any articles that have spent nearly as much time figuring out what happened with the decline in the black vote, looking at Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia.”

AD

The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.

“You do hear over and over again from women in focus groups, ‘I would like to see a female president, but I think it would be harder for a woman to win,’ ” said one Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private surveys. “People are projecting who people will vote for, who they think will win.”

AD

Some Democratic candidates have directly addressed such fears. Both Castro and Booker have regularly urged Democrats to avoid defaulting to a “safe” choice.

AD

“People have been traumatized by a president who often sounds more like George Wallace than we would hope would sound like George Washington,” Booker said in an interview.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has leaned into her history-making quality as potentially the first female president, has made calls for dreaming big and doing hard things a central part of her message. And at the last Democratic debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) tried to dispel doubts that a woman could take on Trump.

“Women are held to a higher standard — otherwise we could play a game called ‘Name Your Favorite Female President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men,” Klobuchar said. She cited the example of the House speaker. “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,” she said.

Karen Finney, a strategist who worked on Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said the recent gains by women and minorities, including the election of Obama and the nomination of Clinton, do not erase the head winds faced by such candidates.

“There is still cultural bias, frankly,” Finney said. “Some of it is unconscious. There is a sexism and some racism about what a leader looks like and who we think can win.”

In public polls, voters give conflicting signals about their association of race and sex with electability. A June Los Angeles Times/USC survey found that when Democratic voters were asked to describe the characteristics of a nominee with the best chance of beating Trump, 68 percent said that imaginary candidate would be white and 70 percent said the person would be a man.

On the other hand, a September Washington Post-ABC News poll found nearly 8 in 10 saying a candidate’s race did not matter in his or her ability to defeat Trump, while nearly 7 in 10 said the same about gender.

AD

Booker and Castro have argued that rules of the nominating process have contributed to the struggles of nonwhite candidates. Castro points to the enormous influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, two overwhelmingly white states, on selecting the nominee.

Booker blames the rules for qualifying for the Democratic debates, established by party Chair Tom Perez, which emphasize polls and grass-roots fundraising. Such guidelines favor candidates with a narrow appeal, Booker says, and force campaigns to shift focus away from their field programs to raise more money.

Perez allowed 20 candidates to attend the first debates, and he has been gradually winnowing the stage. All the networks hosting debates are required by the party to have nonwhite and female representation among the moderators.

Booker argued that for the January debate, the qualifications should be changed to include endorsements in Iowa and other factors like whether a candidate is considered a second or third choice in the state.

“It is unacceptable that there is a true competition in Iowa that you will not get to see right before their caucus,” Booker said. “That incongruence is unacceptable.” The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3.

Another obstacle for nonwhite candidates has been the staying power of former vice president Joe Biden. He received 27 percent support from Democratic-leaning voters overall in a late October Washington Post-ABC News poll, but 30 percent support among nonwhites and 39 percent support among blacks. Those numbers may shift if he fails to perform well in the early contests in states such as Iowa, where he is polling lower.

Charles Lewis, chairman of the Greenwood County Democratic Party in South Carolina, said many voters in the first Southern state to cast its primary vote feel safer with Biden’s profile.

“I think because he is, of all things, an older white man and this is the South,” said Lewis, who is African American. “People think they rolled the dice on Obama, but now let’s be safe this time and let’s get something done.”"

The Investigations

WE READ THE 300 PAGE REPORT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO: Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee laid out an extensive case that President Trump abused the powers of the presidency by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations into his political opponents — compromising America's national security for his personal gain.

Democrats not only meticulously outlined Trump's alleged misconduct — based on “two months of testimony from diplomats and administration officials, in addition to call records and other evidence discovered by the committees” — but said a “campaign to conceal his conduct from the public"" amounts to obstruction.

A watershed moment: The House intelligence Committee approved the report in a partisan 13-to-9 vote on Tuesday night, sending it to the Judiciary Committee. The document will serve as an outline for Democrats on that panel, which is responsible for drafting articles of impeachment against Trump.

The next phase of the impeachment inquiry begins today at 10 a.m.: Judiciary will host law experts to speak about the constitutional grounds for impeachment as the panel determines whether Trump's actions constitute high crimes and misdemeanors.

In the meantime, here's what you need to know from the report:

1. Democrats laid out eight different episodes of how Trump propelled a ""scheme"" to condition a White House meeting and $400 million in military aid to Ukraine upon a public announcement by its government of investigations that would help his reelection campaign.

The core of Democrats' case is this alleged quid pro quo for probes of of vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, according to our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, and Seung Min Kim.

for probes of of vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, according to our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, and Seung Min Kim. The report doesn't mince words on how this is an abuse of power: “President Trump used the power of the Office of the President and exercised his authority over the executive branch, including his control of the instruments of the federal government, to apply increasing pressure on the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically-motivated investigations desired by President Trump.”

“President Trump used the power of the Office of the President and exercised his authority over the executive branch, including his control of the instruments of the federal government, to apply increasing pressure on the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically-motivated investigations desired by President Trump.” From the Democrats: “The President’s actions have damaged our national security, undermined the integrity of the next election, and violated his oath of office,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), whose panels have overseen the inquiry, said in a statement to our colleagues.

2. Democrats are at least preparing to accuse Trump of obstructing Congress, though the report does not outline the specific articles of impeachment the president could face. The report found that a dozen witnesses “followed President Trump’s orders, defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify.”

“This allegation is an entire section of the report, encompassing more than 50 pages. Democrats point out that an article of impeachment drawn up against Richard M. Nixon was for his failure to comply with subpoenas,” our colleague Amber Philips reports.

Dems allege Trump's obstruction is unprecedented: “Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiries — including Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton — acknowledged Congress’ authority to investigate and, to varying degrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas​​​​​,” according to the report.

“Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiries — including Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton — acknowledged Congress’ authority to investigate and, to varying degrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas​​​​​,” according to the report. And will cause serious harm to U.S. democracy: “The damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the president’s ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked,” the report concludes. “Any future president will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three.”

3. Whether House Democrats will impeach Trump for “bribery” is still an unknown.

From Karoun : “The document concluded that Trump and his subordinates 'conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, on politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump’s domestic political opponent.' But it stopped short of recommending that Trump be impeached for what Schiff said those words constitute: bribery, which is one of the premises upon which the Constitution says Congress may remove a president from office.”

“The document concluded that Trump and his subordinates 'conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, on politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump’s domestic political opponent.' Schiff told Karoun in an interview ""that’s exactly what’s gone on here"" -- though it's up to Judiciary to recommend impeaching Trump on bribery: “This is certainly, I think, what the founders had in mind when they used that word in the Constitution.""

4. Call records show extensive contact between Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and the White House during key moments of the Ukraine episode.

""The call records provide powerful circumstantial evidence that Giuliani was coordinating with the White House on his Ukraine gambit, something Giuliani has previously acknowledged. The records also show contact between a Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, and one of Trump’s key defenders in Congress, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.),"" our colleagues Paul Sonne, Rosalind Helderman, and Greg Miller report.

As just one example: ""The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and [Zelensky] that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and '-1' on Aug. 8. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, is also simultaneously serving as the acting White House chief of staff.""

Who is the owner of the '-1' phone line?: ""Investigators are trying to determine whether the unidentified phone number belongs to Mr. Trump, said [Schiff]. If so, the phone calls with Mr. Giuliani could be further evidence of the president’s direct involvement in the Ukraine affair,"" the New York Times's Sharon LaFraniere and Julian Barnes report.

""Investigators are trying to determine whether the unidentified phone number belongs to Mr. Trump, said [Schiff]. the New York Times's Sharon LaFraniere and Julian Barnes report. AT&T and Verizon were likely subpoenaed: As our colleagues note, the report attributes the phone records to “document production” from the companies. ""The report doesn’t say whose phone records were subpoenaed, but the text suggests the committee obtained extensive records of calls by Giuliani and Parnas.""

As our colleagues note, the report attributes the phone records to “document production” from the companies. ""The report doesn’t say whose phone records were subpoenaed, but the text suggests the committee obtained extensive records of calls by Giuliani and Parnas."" Nunes responded to the call records on Tuesday night on Fox News:

5. Democrats say Trump's pattern of behavior requires urgent action the president potentially solicits another foreign government for help in the 2020 election:

First it was Russia, then Ukraine: “Democrats tried to place Mr. Trump’s conduct in a broader context of wrongdoing that they said dated to the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump, they argued, first accepted help from one foreign power, Russia, to win the presidency, and then turned around and tried to enlist another, Ukraine, to bolster his 2020 reelection campaign,” the New York Times' Michael Shear and Nick Fandos report.

Mr. Trump, they argued, first accepted help from one foreign power, Russia, to win the presidency, and then turned around and tried to enlist another, Ukraine, to bolster his 2020 reelection campaign,” the New York Times' Michael Shear and Nick Fandos report. And take China as another example: The report notes that “on October 3, 2019, even as our Committee was engaged in this inquiry, President Trump publicly declared anew that other countries should open investigations into his chief political rival, saying, 'China should start an investigation into the Bidens,' and that 'President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.'”

6. There could be more to come: Former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration Neal Katyal tweeted that the most important language is in the first sentence of the report.

“The Committee Report details the evidence gathered 'THUS FAR.' They are clearly laying down a marker that the investigation continues and that the President is bent on obstructing it/trying to gag [executive branch] employees from telling the truth,” he added.

7. The report is likely to do little to sway Trump's Republican allies on the Hill, who released a draft of their own 123-page counter-report yesterday.

From the White House: “Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,” press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. “Chairman Schiff’s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.”

On The Hill

HAPPENING TODAY: The Judiciary hearing today will feature “some of Capitol Hill’s most aggressive and colorful characters — Republicans and Democrats,” our colleagues Elise Viebeck, Mike DeBonis, and Rachael Bade report.

What to watch: “There could be disruptions from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) … There could be conspiracy theories from Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) … And there could be antics from Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a vocal Trump critic who brought a bucket of fried chicken to a hearing in May to highlight the absence of Attorney General William P. Barr, who was scheduled to testify.""

“It’s a bunch of brawlers sometimes on the Judiciary Committee, so it should get pretty hot under the collar as we go along,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the panel, said on Fox News over the weekend.

Nadler used an expletive in a closed-door meeting to state clearly he was not going to put up with antics on either side of the aisle. From Politico's Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris: ""[The] rare cuss word from the lawyerly Manhattan Democrat that prompted some lawmakers to sit up in their chairs, according to multiple people in the room.”

All eyes will be on Nadler: “Nadler’s warning shot referred to likely GOP antics to try to undermine the first impeachment hearing in the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. But it wasn’t lost on Democrats that Nadler’s message could also apply to those in his own party who have closely scrutinized his role in the House's impeachment probe,” per Caygle and Ferris.

Leading the impeachment fight for Republicans: Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.). ""Known as a Southern spitfire among his colleagues, [he] steered the GOP through several rowdy Judiciary hearings related to the Russia probe earlier this year,"" Politico's Melanie Zanona reports. ""During the impeachment proceedings, Collins and his band of Republicans on the panel are expected to hammer Democrats over their process and the breakneck pace of their impeachment probe.""

Collins's star turn comes at a crucial time: Georgia will soon have an open Senate seat after Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson retires at the end of the year. Trump favors Collins to be appointed to the chamber, but the state's Gov. Brian Kemp is expected to tap business executive Kelly Loeffler instead, our colleague Seung Min Kim reported. Regardless, Collins will still be on national T.V. today defending the president, which could also further stoke the intraparty fight over the appointment.

The People

GOP TURNS TO DEBUNKED CONSPIRACY TO DEFEND TRUMP: A number of Republican lawmakers are pressing ahead with debunked claims about Ukraine as they defend Trump based on conspiracy theories that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has helped spread, our colleagues Robert Costa and Karoun Demirjian report.

Key quote from a seasoned GOP foreign policy figure: “Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission told our colleagues. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission told our colleagues. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.” They're led by Sen. John Kennedy (La.), who is known for his folksy idioms and easy access to the press, though even he appeared to grow tired of talking about the subject, according to a Politico report.

The claims that seek to cast blame on Kyiv rather than Moscow for interfering in the 2016 election are debunked: We’re repeating this for the people in the back.

If you want to dive further into the subject: There have been multiple detailed fact checks, including by our colleague Glenn Kessler who wrote there were “not enough Pinocchios” for one particular debunked theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s emails. David Hale, the No. 3 official at the State Department, also testified that he is not aware of any evidence Ukraine meddled in the election.

David Hale, the No. 3 official at the State Department, also testified that he is not aware of any evidence Ukraine meddled in the election. What is happening: Russia is actively trying to interfere in the 2020 election, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified in July and Hale reiterated yesterday.

Some GOP members have had enough: “I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham said the strategy is hurting Trump: “It was the Russians. I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the DNC was by Russian operatives, no one else,” the South Carolina senator told reporters on Capitol Hill, CNN’s Phil Mattingly and Chandelis Duster report.

The Campaign

HARRIS IS OUT: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) “proved an uneven campaigner and was ultimately engulfed by low polling numbers, internal turmoil and a sense that she was unable to provide a clear message amid the roiling, impassioned politics of the moment,” our colleague Chelsea Janes writes in The Post’s postmortem.

Other possible implications: “The most diverse primary field in U.S. history is now one that may well be represented in its December debate by four white men and two white women,” our colleague Philip Bump writes.

A number of activists are concerned about the very real prospect of this happening:

No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic.

TRUMP MEETS WITH JOHNSON: “Boris Johnson and [Trump] snuck in a quick private meeting Tuesday evening with little fanfare ahead of a NATO leaders' meeting in London Wednesday,” Politico Europe's Emilio Casalicchio reports.

Why the hush-hush?: “Johnson wants to avoid appearing too close to his U.S. counterpart, who is deeply unpopular in Britain, for fear it could scupper his chances in the country's general election next week,” Politico reports. “That could explain why the meeting was not announced in advance.”

Trump seemed to get this telling reporters “I'll stay out of the election,” but shortly thereafter added “I think Boris is very capable and I think he'll do a good job.” Though those words are a far cry from July when Trump said people called Johnson “Britain's Trump.”

During a news conference Tuesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), said “the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.”

The report attributes the phone records to “document production” from AT&T and Verizon, suggesting the companies were subpoenaed. The report doesn’t say whose phone records were subpoenaed, but the text suggests the committee obtained extensive records of calls by Giuliani and Parnas.



Giuliani’s phone records include calls with a number designated only as “-1,” sometimes close in time to calls between Giuliani and the White House switchboard. The suggestion is that “-1” might be a phone belonging to Trump, though the report does not state that clearly.

AD

AD

Schiff, speaking to the Los Angeles Times, said he suspects the number could be Trump’s and that the committee is trying to find out whether calls logged as “-1” indeed came from the president.

A lawyer for Giuliani declined to comment.

The records show that Giuliani made several calls to the White House on April 24, the same day that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was summoned to Washington and told that she had lost Trump’s confidence. Giuliani called the White House at least seven times that day between 7:47 a.m. and 8:09 p.m. He also received a call from a White House number and spent more than eight minutes on the line with “-1.”

AD

The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and “-1” on Aug. 8.

AD

Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, is also simultaneously serving as the acting White House chief of staff.

The report uses the phone records to bolster evidence that Giuliani, his associates and “one or more individuals from the White House” coordinated a smear campaign against former vice president Joe Biden.

AD

In the weeks leading up to Biden’s April 25 announcement that he would seek the presidency, the logs show contacts between Giuliani, Parnas and John Solomon, then a conservative columnist for the Hill newspaper.

On the day that Biden announced his campaign, Solomon published a piece alleging that Ukraine had planted Russia collusion allegations against the Trump campaign. The column also described Biden’s efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor and questioned whether Biden had acted to protect his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company facing an investigation, as the fired prosecutor has alleged. No evidence has surfaced backing the prosecutor’s claim.

AD

At 7:14 p.m. that evening, Giuliani received a call from “-1” that lasted nearly five minutes. Moments later, according to the records, Giuliani spoke to Fox News host Sean Hannity for 36 seconds. Later that night, Trump was a guest on Hannity’s show. The Fox News host asked Trump to respond to Solomon’s latest column.

AD

Trump said, “that sounds like big, big stuff. I’m not surprised.”

The call records also show a number of phone calls between Nunes and Giuliani and between Nunes and Parnas earlier this year. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, has accused Nunes and his staff of participating in Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.

Call records also show that on May 10, as Giuliani came under fire for a planned trip to Ukraine to meet Zelensky, the former New York mayor began trading missed calls with Kash Patel, an official at the White House National Security Council who previously worked for Nunes.

AD

In the afternoon, after the aborted calls, Giuliani and Patel managed to connect and spoke for over 25 minutes, according to the report. Five minutes later, Giuliani connected with “-1” for more than 17 minutes.

AD

Patel has denied news reports — based in part on the closed-door testimony from Fiona Hill, former top Russia adviser on the National Security Council — that he was serving as a back-channel to Trump on Ukraine issues.

“At no time have I ever communicated with the president on any matters involving Ukraine,” Patel said earlier this year in a statement to Axios. “Any reporting to the contrary, and any testimony provided to Congress, is simply false, and any current or former staff who suggest I have raised or discussed Ukraine matters with President Trump, are similarly misinformed or spreading outright falsehoods.”

AD

The report Tuesday doesn’t detail any communications between Patel and Trump regarding Ukraine. It does say that he was talking to Giuliani right at the moment when Ukraine was at the top of the former New York mayor’s agenda.



AD

After his call with Patel and “-1,” Giuliani went on Fox News and said that he would be canceling his trip to Ukraine, because Zelensky was surrounded by “enemies of the president.”

A spokesman for the National Security Council didn’t respond to a request for comment regarding Patel’s call. Nunes, speaking on Tuesday to Hannity on Fox News, said he has known Giuliani for a long time and spoke with him about Robert S. Mueller III’s probe. Nunes said he didn’t really recall the name Parnas but it was possible he had spoken to him and needed to check his phone records. “But it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people,” Nunes said.

AD

Another Parnas lawyer, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., reiterated that, “with appropriate protections,” his client would fill in the blanks for lawmakers on the content of the calls. “All phone records show you is that a phone call was made,” he said. “It takes a participant in the phone call to tell you what was said.”

AD

It is unlikely Parnas will actually testify. Parnas is seeking immunity from Congress before talking to lawmakers. Such a move could complicate the campaign finance charges against him in federal court in New York, and lawmakers rarely take such a step without the blessing of the Justice Department. He has denied wrongdoing.

Trump, looking to showcase foreign policy wins as he heads into an election year, offered a more optimistic outlook for NATOs future. He took credit for boosting the share of NATO nations that are meeting the alliance’s goal of spending 2% of gross domestic on defense and sought to pressure more countries to increase their military budgets. But he also put a spotlight on his administration’s lingering to-do list: ending a China trade war he instigated, passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement as well as trade deals with the European Union and Britain.

A day after Trudeau was overheard gossiping about Trump during a reception at Buckingham Palace, Trump called the Canadian leader “two-faced.” In an unguarded conversation, Trudeau told leaders, including Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that “he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top,” an apparent reference to Trump’s long and unscheduled question-and-answer session with journalists earlier that day. Trudeau also said, seemingly about his meeting with Trump: “You just watched his team’s jaws drop to the floor.”

Trump fired back during a Wednesday afternoon meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He suggested that the Canadian’s overheard comments were precipitated by Trump’s decision to highlight the fact that Canada falls short of NATO goals on defense spending.

AD

AD

“The truth is that I called him out on the fact that he’s not paying 2% and I guess he’s not very happy about it,” Trump said. Later, seeming to relish the spat, Trump remarked “That was funny when I said that guy was two-faced.”

Relations between Trump and Macron, once the American president’s closest European ally, deteriorated a day earlier in feisty exchanges on live television.

First, Trump laced into the French president for what he called “very, very nasty” comments by Macron, who had lamented NATO’s “brain death” under Trump’s leadership of the U.S. Then, in a later meeting on the sidelines of the summit, Macron rebuked Trump over his insistence that Europe repatriate its citizens who fought with the Islamic State group, as well as his unilateral decision to withdraw American troops from northeast Syria.

AD

AD

Trump’s shift on Syria had cleared the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had been allied with the west in the fight against IS militants. There was more disagreement between Trump and European leaders over Turkey. Macron, in particular, wanted the alliance to do more to confront Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over his incursion into Syria and his purchase of Russian surface-to-air missiles.

On Wednesday, Trump falsely claimed that Macron had taken back his comments about NATO’s “brain death,” even though the French leader said he stood by them.

It was far from the only inconsistency highlighted during two days of summitry.

AD

Trump, who has celebrated every new stock market high, claimed that he didn’t pay too much heed to the market after stocks tumbled following his remarks that a China trade deal may not come until after Election Day. He also claimed that it was his decision not to more quickly reach an agreement with China, as relations have soured over U.S. support for pro-Democracy protests in Hong Kong. Previously, Trump had said that it was China that would rather wait for the election results.

AD

Trump also declared NATO to be the healthiest it’s ever been even as the alliance is grappling with fundamental questions about its funding and whether its requirement for mutual defense still makes sense as it confronts threats that now extend beyond Russia to a rising China and international terrorism.

Trump has resisted some European efforts to put more pressure on Erdogan, whom he met with on the sidelines of the summit. The president praised the Turkish leader despite widespread calls in Washington and Europe for the Turkish government to suffer consequences for its actions in Syria and decision to buy the Russian air defense system.

AD

The president abruptly canceled a news conference that would have played out at the same time as the impeachment hearing in Washington. But he insisted he’s unconcerned about the inquiry, with Democrats facing a mountainous climb to remove Trump from office. While Democrats hold the majority in the House, Republicans control the Senate and not one GOP lawmaker in the upper chamber has signaled support for ousting Trump. An impeachment conviction in the Senate would require 67 votes out of 100.

AD

Still, Trump lashed out at Democratic lawmakers for scheduling the hearing while he was overseas and predicted low ratings for testimony from constitutional experts.

“These people, you almost question whether or not they love our country,” Trump said of the Democrats.

AD

Democrats argue that Trump acted improperly when he pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s dealings in the eastern European nation. Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.

During his meeting with Merkel, Trump told reporters he didn’t know why his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was speaking with the White House Office of Management and Budget — a revelation that was included in phone records published in the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment report.

AD

“I really don’t know,” he said. Trump encouraged reporters to ask Giuliani about the calls, but insisted they are “no big deal.”

AD

Trump has frequently criticized NATO members for falling well short in doing their financial part through the first three years of his presidency, and he was eager to take credit for recent increases in defense spending by alliance members.

After a NATO summit last year, he called for members to devote at least 4% of GDP to military spending and took particular aim at Merkel, whom he accused of paying Russia ‘”billions of dollars for gas and energy” while failing to meet her nation’s commitment on defense spending.

At this year’s summit, he told reporters: “I don’t think, frankly, before us, that NATO was changing at all, and NATO is really changing right now.’’

AD

But while NATO leaders emphasized unity, Trump convened his own sub-group of the alliance — limited to only those who had met the defense spending target.

AD

“We call them affectionately those two percent-ers,” he said of the nine nations assembled of the soon-to-be 30-member alliance. “So this is a lunch that’s on me.”

THE BIG IDEA: Research experiments conducted by social scientists help illustrate why it’s so insidious for President Trump and his congressional defenders to keep parroting the debunked conspiracy theory, which originated with Russian intelligence agencies, that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.

People who are repeatedly exposed to the same false information, even if they’re initially told that it is false, feel fewer qualms sharing it on social media after each additional time they see it. In five experiments involving more than 2,500 Americans, Daniel Effron, who teaches organizational behavior at the London Business School, and Medha Raj, a PhD student at the University of Southern California, documented how seeing a fake headline just once leads individuals to temper their disapproval of the misinformation when they see it a second, third or fourth time. They outline their findings in the new edition of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

The researchers asked online survey participants to rate how unethical or acceptable they thought it would be to publish a fake headline, and how likely they would be to like, share, block or unfollow the person who posted it. Participants were much more prone to “like” or share headlines they’d seen previously and less likely to block or unfollow the person who posted them, even if they were warned the information was false. The results shows a tendency of humans to misremember false headlines as true because they’ve seen them before. The researchers argue that repeating misinformation in the echo chamber of something like social media lends it a “ring of truthfulness” that can increase people’s tendency to give it a moral pass, regardless of whether they believe it.

“Misinformation can stoke political polarization and undermine democracy, so it is important for people to understand when and why it spreads,” said Effron.

-- Thus far, the truth is that the president’s broader efforts to muddy the waters surrounding the Ukraine affair have been remarkably effective. About four dozen national and state polls have now been conducted since the impeachment inquiry was announced. Public attitudes have stayed remarkably consistent, and they didn’t shift in a statistically significant way after the televised congressional hearings. Our in-house pollsters Scott Clement and Emily Guskin review the data:

“Democrats and Republicans are mirror opposites on the issue, with an average of 86 percent of Democrats supporting impeachment, compared with 9 percent of Republicans. Democrats have grown more united in their support for impeachment since before the inquiry began, when polls showed roughly two-thirds supported impeachment. Among Republicans, an average of 87 percent are opposed, while 8 percent of Democrats say the same. …

“The stability of Trump’s approval ratings affirms just how locked-in Americans are in their views toward Trump, even as some independents and Democrats changed their opinion on whether Congress should impeach and remove him from office. The lack of movement in this essential measure of Trump’s political standing also indicates that while most Americans think Trump did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, news and congressional testimony about this issue have not shifted how people feel about the president.”

-- Anecdotal evidence also bears this out. An Associated Press reporter interviewed voters around Wisconsin last week and found that many either aren’t paying attention or don’t know how to decipher the back-and-forth over the president’s conduct. To wit: “Everything they say, it’s so repetitive. To me, it’s like they’re beating their heads against the wall,” said Harry Rose, a 78-year-old retired factory worker and Trump supporter in Racine County. Nicole Morrison, a 36-year-old nurse who can’t see herself voting for Trump in 2020, had a similar review. “There’s so much information that sometimes it’s hard to decide which is the truth and which is just rumors,” she said. “So I just don’t pay attention to it.”

-- In a preface to the House Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday afternoon, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) noted that the core facts aren’t in dispute and warned about the “corrosive” dangers of tribalism. “If there was one ill the Founding Founders feared as much as that of an unfit president, it may have been that of excessive factionalism,” Schiff wrote. “Although the Framers viewed parties as necessary, they also endeavored to structure the new government in such a way as to minimize the ‘violence of faction.’ As George Washington warned in his farewell address, ‘the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.’”

The Constitution is mentioned more than 100 times in the 300-page report, which alleges that Trump “compromised national security to advance his personal political interests” and engaged in an “unprecedented campaign” to obstruct congressional efforts to uncover his abuses of power. “Today, we may be witnessing a collision between the power of a remedy meant to curb presidential misconduct and the power of faction determined to defend against the use of that remedy on a president of the same party,” Schiff concluded. “But perhaps even more corrosive to our democratic system of governance, the President and his allies are making a comprehensive attack on the very idea of fact and truth. How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences?”

-- A procession of events over the past 24 hours underscored the pervasiveness of factionalism. The Intelligence Committee approved Schiff’s report on a party-line, 13-to-9 vote. Republicans on the committee released their own 123-page prebuttal the day before that said Trump’s approach to Ukraine was founded on “genuine and reasonable” suspicions about the country.

-- Attending the NATO summit in London, meanwhile, Trump accused Democrats of being “unpatriotic” by moving ahead with impeachment while he’s traveling overseas. Trump then suggested that Schiff might be “in a jail” if he wasn’t in Congress for what he’s said about the president. “I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being,” Trump said. “I think he’s a very sick man.” Trump boasted that Democrats trying to impeach him is getting rank-and-file Republicans to rally around him. “I don’t think we’ve ever had the spirit right now that we have in the Republican Party, and the impeachment hoax is what’s done it,” he said, adding that the GOP is will stick together “like glue” because of the investigations.

Democrats punched back, such as New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. But this only underscored the partisan divisions:

Unpatriotic?



You are not a King.



You are not the Chosen One.



You are not the Supreme Leader.



You are an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to our democracy who will be held accountable for your brazen #AbuseOfPower.



Count. On. It.

A video that went viral overnight shows three foreign leaders apparently laughing about Trump’s antics behind his back during a reception at Buckingham Palace. Unaware that they were on camera, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seemed to ask Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron if they were late for their audience with Queen Elizabeth II because of Trump’s impromptu press conference. “You just watched his team’s jaws drop to the floor,” Trudeau answers.

This morning, Trump called Trudeau “two-faced” for his comments on the hot mic. Sitting beside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he added that the Canadian was just lashing out because he called him out for not spending enough money on defense.

-- Perhaps the most revealing illustration of the tribalism, though, came last night when 71 House Republicans voted against a bipartisan resolution saying that Russia should not be allowed to attend future Group of Seven summits until it respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors, gives Crimea back to Ukraine and adheres to the standards of democratic societies. The measure passed with 339 votes, including unanimous Democratic support and 116 Republicans.

Republican lawmakers loudly and overwhelmingly cheered Mitt Romney when, as the party’s nominee for president in 2012, he declared that Russia was the biggest geostrategic threat facing the United States. Now, with a very different standard-bearer in Trump, many of those same lawmakers try to look the other way as a revanchist Russia viciously asserts itself against free societies and deepens strategic ties with communist China. In this case, 71 did. (The list of Republicans who voted with Russia is here.)

Trump wants to welcome an emboldened Vladimir Putin back into the fold. At the G-7 summit in France this summer, Trump strongly advocated on Russia’s behalf over multiple days. He even announced plans to invite Putin to the G-7 summit in the United States. Rank-and-file Republicans take cues from right-wing elites, including Trump and Tucker Carlson, who has used his prime-time platform on Fox News to make some startling, eyebrow-raising comments about Russia in recent days. “I think we should probably take the side of Russia, if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine,” Carlson said last week.

-- A Post contributing columnist who formerly served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia and has held a senior post on the National Security Council under Barack Obama, chastised Carlson:

I speak Russian. I know Russia. I've lived there for 8 years of my life. You are wrong Mr. Carlson. Putin does hate America. You (I assume unwittingly) help his anti-American objectives with these ill-informed rants. Be a patriot. Stop attacking Americans & defending Putin. https://t.co/izg1TwNJwH — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) December 3, 2019

-- “The inchoate and unproved nature of the Republican case against Ukraine has not prevented several GOP leaders from taking up the cause,” Bob Costa and Karoun Demirjian report. “There is also a growing view inside the GOP that the party’s core voters will not revolt if the party takes a softer position on Russia — a calculation backed by polling during Trump’s presidency. Gallup’s surveys, for instance, show that an expanding group of Republicans — 40 percent in July 2018 — now says Russia is a U.S. ally or is friendly, up from 22 percent in 2014, while 25 percent of Democrats say the same, little changed from 2014.”

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” said Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

-- As other Republicans have capitulated to Trump on Russia, Romney is holding firm. “I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” the senator from Utah told reporters on Tuesday. “Leaders of the countries are pulling for one candidate or another, that’s to be expected, but there’s a big difference between pulling for someone, hoping someone wins in the American election and interfering in the way Russia did.”

-- Many Democratic lawmakers are forcefully rejecting the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered, but this also has the unintended consequence of drawing more attention to the underlying false claim. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he’s sat through more than 25 hearings and briefings about what happened in 2016. “In none of those meetings was there ever a hint, a breath, a suggestion, a word that somehow Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election in the interference or the influence campaign. It was Russia. And it was Russia in a systematic, widespread way,” King said on CNN.

Ukrainians, including government officials, spoke out against Trump publicly in 2016 after he said that maybe Crimea should remain part of Russia. “That would be like us being angry that somebody else took Florida,” King noted. “I mean, it was understandable, but that's been blown up into somehow that Ukraine was involved in the 2016 interference campaign. It wasn't.”

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), asked David Hale, the third-ranking official at the State Department, a hearing yesterday if there was any reason to doubt Fiona Hill’s testimony last month that the conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s interference in 2016 “is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian Security Services themselves.” Hale said he did. “Is our national security made stronger or weaker when members of the administration or members of Congress insist on repeating debunked Russian lies?” Menendez asked. “That does not serve our interest,” Hale replied.

-- This whole donnybrook is just the latest illustration of the president refusing to believe his own intelligence briefings. Speaking publicly for the first time since being pushed out of government after 30 years of service, former deputy director of national intelligence Sue Gordon told the Women’s Foreign Policy Group on Tuesday that one of Trump's most common responses to intelligence briefings is to doubt what he's being told. She said “I don’t think that’s true” was the president’s most frequent reply. Trump broke with protocol by blocking Gordon from becoming acting director of national intelligence when Dan Coats stepped down this summer.

“Gordon seemed to suggest that it was more difficult trying to figure out where the President had gotten the information that was shaping his beliefs and opinions than dealing with his tendency to doubt what he was being told,” CNN reports. “Gordon's ouster came about because Trump, who has had a contentious relationship with his own intelligence services, wanted a political loyalist in the role who would ‘rein in’ the intelligence agencies. … Gordon suggested that the President's intelligence briefers not only faced a challenge because of Trump's lack of familiarity with the world of intelligence, but also because he consumes information and hears opinions that aren't as carefully vetted as an intelligence product.”

-- Believe it or not, the rank partisanship will grow even starker as the impeachment process shifts today from the Intelligence Committee to the House Judiciary Committee. Trump’s defenders are intent on making the process look as partisan and circus-like as possible, and they now have a good venue to do so. Some of Capitol Hill’s most aggressive and colorful characters are members, from Matt Gaetz and Louie Gohmert on the Republican side to Steve Cohen and Sheila Jackson Lee on the Democratic side.

Nancy Pelosi gets to handpick the members of the Intelligence Committee. Schiff keeps his members on a much tighter leash. In contrast, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is much more free-wheeling. That’s partly how that Corey Lewandowski hearing got so out of hand in September. Nadler says he’s ready for the spotlight this time. (Elise Viebeck, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore the power dynamics within the committee more deeply.) “It’s a bunch of brawlers sometimes on the Judiciary Committee, so it should get pretty hot under the collar as we go along,” said Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the panel, during an interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Phone-call records disclosed in the Intelligence Committee’s new report show extensive contact between Rudy Giuliani and the White House during key moments of the Ukraine saga. Paul Sonne, Rosalind S. Helderman and Greg Miller report: “The call records provide powerful circumstantial evidence that Giuliani was coordinating with the White House on his Ukraine gambit, something Giuliani has previously acknowledged. The records also show contact between a Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, and one of Trump’s key defenders in Congress, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.). … [Schiff] said ‘the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.’ …

“Giuliani’s phone records include calls with a number designated only as ‘-1,’ sometimes close in time to calls between Giuliani and the White House switchboard. The suggestion is that ‘-1’ might be a phone belonging to Trump, though the report does not state that clearly. Schiff, speaking to the Los Angeles Times, said he suspects the number could be Trump’s and that the committee is trying to find out whether calls logged as ‘-1’ indeed came from the president. …

“The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and [Volodymyr Zelensky] that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and ‘-1’ on Aug. 8. … The call records also show a number of phone calls between Nunes and Giuliani and between Nunes and Parnas earlier this year. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, has accused Nunes and his staff of participating in Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.”

-- The report details 58 calls Giuliani made over the course of six days. (Philip Bump breaks them down here.)

-- Nunes, speaking last night to Sean Hannity on Fox News, said it’s “possible” that he spoke with Parnas, although he doesn’t recall doing so. “I remember that name now, because he’s been indicted,” said the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. “But it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people. … We have Americans and foreigners contact us every single day with information.” He also dismissed questions about his contacts with Giuliani. “We were actually laughing about how [Bob] Mueller bombed out,” Nunes said of his conversations with Giuliani. (Felicia Sonmez)

QUOTE OF THE DAY: ""They weren’t talking about where to find sushi in Kyiv,"" Parnas's lawyer said of the phone conversations between his client and Nunes. He's trying to get immunity in exchange for the testimony of his client, who has been indicted on a host of charges. ( Wall Street Journal )

THE LEGAL BATTLES:

-- Trump’s personal attorneys remain on the sidelines as the president battles the inquiry. Carol D. Leonnig reports: “The president is relying almost exclusively on White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and his in-house team of attorneys … The White House lawyers are not sharing with his personal attorneys some internal government records central to the inquiry about the pressure the administration put on Ukraine, citing the need to protect executive privilege. The unusual decision to have the White House counsel captain the president’s defense — at least for now — departs from how previous presidents have contended with impeachment proceedings and has worried some Trump allies, who believe a multipronged defense would be stronger. … Cipollone has taken the lead, operating separately from Jay Sekulow, a conservative Christian legal advocate who is the leader of the president’s personal legal team, joined by seasoned white-collar defense lawyers Jane and Marty Raskin.”

-- A federal judge is weighing whether to order the State Department to release internal communications between Pompeo and two of the three men designated by Trump to steer Ukraine policy. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Christopher R. ‘Casey’ Cooper of Washington on Tuesday heard arguments in a public-records lawsuit seeking communications by Kurt Volker, former State Department envoy to Ukraine, and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, with other State Department officials including Pompeo. … The Trump administration has declined to release records to the House, as part of the White House’s blanket refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. However, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) empowers judges to order the release of documents requested by members of the public, and federal lawsuits to enforce such requests can move much more quickly through the courts than battles over congressional subpoenas.”

-- A federal appeals court ruled that House Democrats can access Trump’s private financial records from two banks, citing a “public interest” by refusing to block congressional subpoenas. Ann E. Marimow and Renae Merle report: “The New York-based appeals court upheld Congress’s broad investigative authority and ordered Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House subpoenas for the president’s financial information. The court gave the president seven days to seek review by the Supreme Court in the case … Sekulow said in a statement Tuesday that Trump’s legal team believes the subpoenas are ‘invalid as issued’ and is reviewing the ruling to determine next steps, ‘including seeking review at the Supreme Court.’”

-- A key witness in Mueller’s investigation has been indicted with seven others on charges of conspiring to funnel more than $3 million in illegal campaign contributions. Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report: “George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates who acted as an intermediary for members of [Trump’s] presidential campaign seeking to forge contacts in the Middle East, was charged with conspiring to make conduit campaign contributions and related offenses in a 53-count indictment unsealed Tuesday in Washington, prosecutors said. U.S. prosecutors also charged Ahmad ‘Andy’ Khawaja, a Lebanese American businessman, with 35 counts related to allegations that he conspired with Nader to conceal the source of more than $3.5 million in campaign contributions directed to U.S. political committees associated with presidential candidates.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 Democratic race. Chelsea Janes reports: The California senator, “proud of being one of the only presidential candidates to spend Thanksgiving in Iowa and not at home, invited reporters into her temporary residence in Des Moines on the holiday to show off her turkey preparation skills. What she didn’t say at the time was that she was also having intensive conversations with her husband, her sister Maya Harris and Maya’s family as the tightknit group grappled with whether there was any path forward for her campaign. The talks extended into late Monday night, as Kamala Harris stayed up until 2 a.m. futilely trying to find a way to push on. But Tuesday around 12:45, she called her staffers to tell them it was all over. … [The end] marked a long, painful fall from her January kickoff, when Harris ran onstage to electrify a crowd of more than 22,000, the embodiment of Democratic hopes that she represented one of their best chances to beat Trump — a rising female star with a mixed-race background who could rebuild the coalition that propelled Barack Obama. …

“In a note to supporters Tuesday, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her departure. ‘I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,’ she wrote. ... Some Democratic activists saw Harris’s departure as a troubling sign that minority candidates are not faring well despite the party’s ostensible sensitivity to diversity. … The news came as a particular shock to backers who that very morning had announced a super PAC to support Harris’s candidacy. Some donors spent the day frantically trying to retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars they had wired into the super PAC’s account. …

""Harris remains a potentially appealing running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee. Unlike the senators staying in the race, she will be free to spend January focused on Trump’s expected Senate impeachment trial … An aide said an assessment of the campaign’s finances conducted over the weekend found that after raising about $12 million in each of the year’s first three quarters, the operation was failing to keep up that pace, raising just ‘a fraction’ of that amount this quarter. That left Harris without money to spend on ads in Iowa and elsewhere, essentially forcing her hand.”

-- Harris’s exit indicates that a once historically diverse Democratic field may winnow down to only whites. Philip Bump reports: “The six candidates who’ve earned a slot [in the next Democratic debate] are white. … Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. [The DNC's] strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.”

-- Castro said Harris’s campaign suffered because the media holds candidates of color to different standards. From BuzzFeed News: “‘I don’t know if it impacted her decision to withdraw from the race or not, but I’m sure it didn’t help,’ Castro, the only Latino candidate running for president, [said] on Tuesday night. ‘This was a narrative from very early on. … From the earliest critique that she has no black support, the [Congressional Black Caucus] is going other directions. It’s just holding people to different standards,’ he said.”

-- As he fights to establish himself as the most liberal candidate, Bernie Sanders has split from Elizabeth Warren with his embrace of far-left foreign leaders. From Politico: “Sanders’ foreign policy views are a clear mark of distinction from Warren in a race in which their domestic agendas are viewed as very similar. Left-wing leaders around the world see an ally in Sanders — Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently thanked him for his ‘solidarity’ and Bolivia's ousted Evo Morales called him ‘hermano Bernie Sanders’ — but have not publicly embraced Warren in the same way. … Sanders has made clear during his campaign that he shares many of the left wing's long-held critiques of American imperialism — from opposition to clandestine interference across the world, but particularly in Latin America and the Middle East, to disapproval of the American military's global footprint. … Warren, by contrast, has been more cautious on foreign affairs, straddling the line between the left and the Democratic foreign policy establishment. She has not been as definitive about the situation in Bolivia, where Morales was forced to resign under pressure by the military after allegations of election fraud in what Sanders deemed a ‘coup.’ Nor has she gone out of her way to praise and cultivate relationships with leftist figures around the world.”

-- North Carolina has a new congressional map for 2020. Ted Mellnik and Tim Meko report: “According to the Associated Press, state judges said the new map, drawn last month by Republican legislators, was good enough for immediate use and that there was not time for further study. The map is likely to add two seats for Democrats in 2020, but it probably won’t end controversy over partisan gerrymandering in the state. … Based on 2016 election results, the new map appears to tilt five districts to Democrats and eight to Republicans. The two new congressional seats expected to favor Democrats are in the 6th and 2nd districts. The 6th will pool Democrats previously divided among three Republican districts around Greensboro. The new 2nd has been carved out of a Democratic stronghold in Raleigh. There is little change in the 12th District, where Charlotte Democrats and minorities remain packed. The Democratic seats under the new map are not locks for the party. The 1st, 2nd and 4th districts all lean Democratic by less than five points, meaning they could have competitive races in 2020.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump unsettled the world stage on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London. Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: “Trump openly jousted with French President Emmanuel Macron — a leader who until recently had been one of Trump’s earliest and most prominent partners in bromance. He thrust Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau uncomfortably into the spotlight, dubbing Trudeau’s country ‘slightly delinquent’ and asking for Canada’s ‘number’ on meeting its financial commitment to NATO’s shared defense. And he previewed a likely confrontation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, also over Germany’s financial contributions to NATO. … To watch Trump perform alongside other world leaders was to witness his use of disequilibrium as political strategy, deployed throughout his presidency to keep everyone slightly off-kilter. Over the course of three one-on-one meetings with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Macron and Trudeau, Trump turned what were expected to be brief photo opportunities into his own personal daytime cable show. As the other leaders largely bore witness, the U.S. president — frequently affable, occasionally bored — held forth for a collective two hours, fielding questions on topics ranging from the impeachment investigation he left at home to the British election campaign he flew into here. …

“At his afternoon appearance with Macron, Trump and the French president articulated their disagreements — at times quite forcefully — but with a veneer of conciliation. … Macron reiterated that he was not backing down from his comments to the Economist. … ‘When we speak about NATO, it’s not just about money. We have to be respectful with our soldiers. The first burden we share, the first cost we pay, is our soldiers’ lives,’ [Macron said]. Trump then turned to Macron and suggested that Europe — and the French president in particular — should shoulder more responsibility for taking back captured Islamic State fighters. ‘Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?’ Trump asked with a smirk. ‘I can give them to you.’ … By nightfall in London, Trump and Macron appeared to have put the day’s acrimony aside. … Several leaders will enter the formal NATO meeting on Wednesday with strategies inside their thick briefing books about what to do if Trump threatens to quit NATO on the spot.”

-- Today is the second day of the NATO summit, and participants are bracing for more contentious meetings. Michael Birnbaum raises the curtain: “Trump was scheduled for a day of highs and lows: after the three-hour discussion with all 28 other NATO leaders, he planned to have lunch with representatives from countries that are meeting spending alliance spending guidelines. It could be a moment to showcase his efforts to boost European defense contributions. But he will also have a one-on-one meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel … At the meeting, leaders are expected to approve a slew of new defense plans in a choreographed move intended to paper over the contentious relations of recent years. They will agree that outer space is a military domain that NATO needs to defend. They will also discuss how the alliance should handle the rise of China as a potential strategic threat. And they will agree on plans for Europe and Canada to spend more money on NATO’s central budget, to save the United States some money — a drop in the bucket in the context of overall defense spending, but still a symbolic gesture to Trump’s demands that other countries pick up some of the slack. Leaders are also expected to clash about a Turkish demand that the alliance give concessions about the Kurdish fighting groups in northeast Syria that have been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Erdogan says the Kurds are dangerous terrorists — and he has blocked unrelated approvals for updated military plans to defend the Baltics from Russia until he gets his way.”

-- The French government threatened massive European Union retaliation if Trump follows through on his threats to slap tariffs on dozens of popular French products. James McAuley reports: “Later in the day, [Trump] suggested that some kind of compromise might be achievable, and [Macron] indicated his willingness to work toward one. This came hours after Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, vowed what he called a ‘strong European riposte’ to Trump’s proposed tariffs.”

-- Trump announced that next year's G-7 summit will be held at Camp David after giving up plans to hold it at his private resort in Doral, Fla. Colby Itkowitz reports: ‘We’re going to do it at Camp David and we’ll be doing some special things at Camp David,’ Trump said. ‘It’s nearby, it’s close. We’re going to give really great access to the press, you’ll have great access. And we’ll have a little bit of a Washington deliverance. But it will be at Camp David, which is a place people like.’ The White House had previously panned suggestions that he host at Camp David in Maryland, as [Obama] had in 2012. ‘I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7,’ acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had said in an Oct. 17 news conference. ‘It was way too small. It was way too remote.’”

-- Trump is waging a war of attrition against America’s diplomats. From GQ: “Previously unpublished data from the AFSA shows that the foreign service is losing people at an alarming clip. In the first two years of Trump’s presidency, nearly half of the State Department’s Career Ministers retired or were pushed out. Another 20 percent of its Minister Counselors, one rank level down, also left.”

-- Trump nearly avoided wading into British politics while at NATO. William Booth and Karla Adam report: The president “was relatively diplomatic Tuesday, promising to ‘stay out’ of British politics, just 10 days before a general election. But he couldn’t quite help himself. In the same breath, Trump declared that his ally Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ‘very capable and I think he’ll do a good job” if elected Dec. 12. As for Johnson’s opponent, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, the president on Tuesday said, ‘I can work with anybody.’”

-- Murky allegations of supposed Russian interference in the British election are flying, with less than two weeks to go before voters head to the polls. Adam Taylor reports: “The latest victim is Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party and a challenger to the Conservative government of Boris Johnson, who had last month proudly displayed a series of leaked government documents that portrayed ongoing bilateral trade negotiations in an unflattering role. On Tuesday, the country’s leading center-right newspaper splashed its front page with a headline that argued the dossier ‘points to Russians.’ Citing an investigation by the consulting firm Graphika, the Daily Telegraph wrote that senior members of the Conservative Party were now calling for Corbyn to ‘come clean.’ But wait — hasn’t the Conservative government been asked to come clean, too? Yes, Johnson’s right-wing government has its own, unresolved issues with Russia. At the start of November, it was accused of sitting on a report that investigates possible Russian interference in British politics, delaying the release of the report’s supposedly damning findings until after the Dec. 12 vote.”

-- Global greenhouse gas emissions will hit another record high this year, experts project. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Total carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry totaled 36.8 billion tons, according to an estimate from the Global Carbon Project, an academic consortium that produces the figures annually. That represents a 0.6 percent increase from 2018, which until now stood as the record. … Global emissions have risen for three consecutive years, at a time when they should be starting to drop sharply if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The news of still-growing greenhouse gas emissions is the latest in a drumbeat of negative findings that come as world leaders gather in Madrid for an annual climate change conference, where they face mounting pressure to alter the current trajectory.”

​​​​​​-- North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is -- quite literally -- back on his white horse, inspecting “revolutionary battle sites” on a sacred mountain as Pyongyang foreshadowed a major policy decision later this month. Simon Denyer and Min Joo Kim report: “The images of Kim on horseback, returning to Mount Paektu after a similar visit in October, were high on symbolism. But it was a second, more dryly worded announcement on Wednesday that was at least as significant. The Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea decided to convene the fifth plenary meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea in the latter part of December, the Korean Central News Agency said, ‘to discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad.’ Put simply, after giving the United States until the end of the year to change its approach to denuclearization talks and warning that North Korea would follow a ‘new path,’ Kim appears to have made his decision on what that path should be, experts said.”

-- China criticized the U.S. House for passing a bill backing sanctions on Beijing over the mass detention of Muslims. Gerry Shih reports: “The Uighur Act cleared the House by 407 to 1 a week after [Trump] signed legislation that would sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials involved in human rights abuses in the protest-ridden financial hub. China has angrily denounced both measures and said Wednesday it would respond to the House’s passage of the Uighur Act, which must be reconciled with a Senate version passed in September before it reaches Trump’s desk. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged the United States to ‘immediately correct its mistake, stop the above bill on Xinjiang from becoming law, and stop using Xinjiang as a way to interfere in China’s domestic affairs.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- McKinsey, the consulting giant, has been helping to support the implementation of the Trump administration's immigration agenda. But some of their draconian suggestions for cost-cutting have been deemed as overly harsh, and even inhumane, by career ICE employees. From ProPublica and the New York Times: “ICE quickly redirected McKinsey toward helping the agency figure out how to execute the White House’s clampdown on illegal immigration. But the money-saving recommendations the consultants came up with made some career ICE workers uncomfortable. They proposed cuts in spending on food for migrants, as well as on medical care and supervision of detainees, according to interviews with people who worked on the project for both ICE and McKinsey and 1,500 pages of documents obtained from the agency after ProPublica filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. McKinsey’s team also looked for ways to accelerate the deportation process, provoking worries among some ICE staff members that the recommendations risked short-circuiting due-process protections for migrants fighting removal from the United States. The consultants, three people who worked on the project said, seemed focused solely on cutting costs and speeding up deportations — actions whose success could be measured in numbers — with little acknowledgment that these policies affected thousands of human beings.”

-- The Trump administration plans on cutting off food stamps benefits for about 750,000 Americans. From Bloomberg News: A new regulation will make it “harder for states to gain waivers from a requirement that beneficiaries work or participate in a vocational training program … The work requirement only applies to ‘able-bodied’ recipients who aren’t caring for a child under 6 years old. The measure would be the first of three Trump administration initiatives curtailing food stamp benefits to take effect. The Urban Institute estimated in an analysis last month that the measures together would cut 3.7 million beneficiaries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, often known by its previous name, food stamps.”

­-- The White House is torpedoing the bipartisan tradition of confirming nominees from both parties for positions at independent agencies. From the National Journal: “For decades, presidents have tapped Republican and Democratic nominees in tandem to fill open slots on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and many other independent bodies. But this week, senators are preparing to confirm Republican Robert Duncan to another term as chairman at one of those agencies, the United States Postal Service Board of Governors, without a Democratic companion.”

-- Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone resigned following accusations that he mishandled sex abuse cases. Chico Harlan reports: “Under Malone’s watch, Buffalo had become perhaps the U.S. Church’s most scandal-tainted diocese. It faces an FBI probe and more than 200 lawsuits. Malone pledged to institute reforms, but he was instead battered by accusations of coverup and by embarrassing leaks. One whistleblower said she found a 300-page dossier on accused priests hidden away in a supply closet near a vacuum cleaner. In a short statement, the Vatican said that Malone would be replaced on a temporary basis by Albany’s bishop, Edward Scharfenberger. Malone, 73, is departing two years before the mandatory age at which bishops must offer their retirements to Pope Francis — though many prelates stay on the job beyond the 75-year mark.”

-- Senate Republicans are poised to confirm either today or tomorrow a Trump judicial nominee who claimed that fertility treatments and surrogacy have “grave effects on society, including diminished respect for motherhood and the unique mother-child bond; exploitation of women; commodification of gestation and of children themselves; and weakening of appropriate social mores against eugenic abortion.” HuffPost reports: “Sarah Pitlyk, [Trump’s] nominee to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, argued those points in a 2017 amicus brief opposing a California statute that protects the right to assisted reproductive technology like in vitro fertilization, or IVF, and gestational surrogacy. Pitlyk … went on to say in a 2017 interview with the National Catholic Register that ‘surrogacy is harmful to mothers and children, so it’s a practice society should not be enforcing.’ Nearly 1 in 6 U.S. couples face infertility, according to a 2014 National Institutes of Health study.

“Pitlyk, 42, fits the mold of many of Trump’s judicial nominees: She’s young, white and a member of the Federalist Society. … She defended anti-abortion activist David Daleiden, who broke federal and state laws by secretly recording and deceptively editing videos that falsely claimed to expose Planned Parenthood’s illegal sale of fetal tissue. She defended Iowa’s six-week abortion ban that was later struck down as unconstitutional. In another case, Pitlyk argued that it is ‘scientific fact’ that ‘human life begins at the moment when a human sperm fertilizes a human egg.’ (It is not scientific fact.)

“So far, Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the only Republican who plans to oppose Pitlyk’s confirmation, meaning Pitlyk has the votes to be confirmed. In a statement, Collins cited Pitlyk’s ‘troubling assertions’ about fertility treatments. … Collins also raised concerns with Pitlyk earning a rare and embarrassing “not qualified” rating by the American Bar Association based on her lack of experience. The rating was unanimously decided. … Pitlyk previously clerked for Brett Kavanaugh. … When Kavanaugh was credibly accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Pitlyk came to his defense. … Pitlyk also publicly dismissed Ford’s story, saying in a CNN interview that it was ‘hard to take it seriously…’”

-- Describing it as an “untamed beast” in “distress,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos wants to spin off the Federal Student Aid office into a new agency. Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports: “The proposal follows a series of missteps involving the office that intensified scrutiny of DeVos’s leadership, including the release of $11 million in loans to unaccredited for-profit colleges and the violation of a court order to halt collections on former Corinthian Colleges students. … Policy experts have questioned whether the office has the economic expertise to meet the challenge and have recommended changes, but they have stopped short of calling for anything on the scale of what DeVos is proposing. … The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators has long urged Congress to review whether the Federal Student Aid office is subject to enough supervision by the education secretary. DeVos referred to the trade group’s past critiques of the office in her speech Tuesday, but the group’s president, Justin Draeger, noted that spinning off the unit was never among its recommendations.”

-- The Supreme Court seems skeptical that Superfund landowners can seek a more extensive cleanup than what the Environmental Protection Agency has approved. Robert Barnes reports: ""The court was considering a massive cleanup of arsenic from a 300-square-mile section of Montana where a copper smelter operated for nearly 100 years. The Anaconda valley has been a Superfund cleanup site since 1983, and owner Atlantic Richfield already has spent more than $470 million to remove toxic chemicals from the land. But nearly 100 homeowners in the area want more work done, and they went to state court in hopes of convincing a jury that the company should pay an additional $50 million to reduce the arsenic level in the ground. The Montana Supreme Court said the suit could proceed. But the question for the U.S. Supreme Court was whether such a supplemental lawsuit undermines the EPA’s authority to implement a cleanup plan it deems appropriate for all parties.”

-- New York City is shipping its homeless to squalid housing out of the state, officials in Newark allege in a new lawsuit. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The complaint, which names the city of New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks as defendants, accuses the city’s Special One-Time Assistance program, or SOTA, of violating commerce laws by pushing recipients into Newark apartments that are not suitable for living and sometimes illegal. The suit comes amid a national battle to mitigate a national homeless crisis that has left many of the country’s urban areas desperate for answers.”

-- Rep. Steve Watkins (R-Kan.) is facing perjury and voter fraud allegations for listing a UPS store as his home residence. From the Topeka Capital-Journal: “Shawnee County records show the first-term Republican listed his official residence as 6021 S.W. 29th St. in Topeka, which corresponds to a UPS Store, when he signed a form to change his residency for voter registration purposes in August, signed an application for a mail-in ballot in October and signed a document to complete advance voting for the November election. It isn’t clear where the congressman physically resided in Kansas after August nor what Topeka precinct he was legally qualified to be part of when voting in November. By asserting his place of residence to be the UPS Store, Watkins left the Topeka City Council’s 5th District for the city council’s 8th District. He then cast a November ballot in an 8th District contest decided by 13 votes.”

-- The D.C. Council voted unanimously to recommend Jack Evans for expulsion over multiple ethics violations. Fenit Nirappil reports: “The action comes after a series of investigations that found Evans, the city’s longest-serving lawmaker, used his public office to benefit private clients and employers who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars. … A person who spoke to Evans on Tuesday afternoon said the lawmaker recognized his council tenure was over and was concerned about being the first member to be expelled but was not yet prepared to resign. … Evans has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. In a letter sent last week, Evans’s lawyers argued that expulsion would override the will of voters.”

Biden’s campaign also mocked Trump’s repeated insistence that the United States requires a president who isn’t a “laughingstock,” ending the ad with a graphic that read, “We need a leader the world respects.” By early Thursday, the roughly minute-long video had been watched more than 5 million times.

The pointed ad marks the continued fallout after Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other dignitaries were caught on camera Tuesday engaging in a brief exchange apparently about Trump that quickly spiraled into an international incident. On Wednesday, Trudeau, Macron and Johnson were forced to field questions about the candid conversation and Trump was described as “the scorned child on the global playground” and “a sulking, brooding president,” The Washington Post reported.

Set to dramatic instrumental music, Biden’s ad opens with Trump grinning and flashing a thumbs up as he stands flanked by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.

But the video quickly cuts to the Tuesday footage of the leaders at Buckingham Palace and their animated conversation.

“World leaders caught on camera laughing about President Trump,” a narrator says.

“Several world leaders mocking President Trump,” another speaker says. The video zooms in on Macron talking before jumping to a close-up of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte mid-laugh. Other clips show Johnson and Trudeau smiling.

The ad then calls attention to other occasions where Trump has been met with derision from foreign leaders, including video of the president addressing the U.N. General Assembly last year, where his remarks were met with “audible guffaws” from audience members, The Post’s David Nakamura reported.

“A president the world is laughing at,” reads all-caps text superimposed on footage from Trump’s address.

As videos of Trump play, Biden slams the president, calling him “insincere, ill-informed, corrupt, dangerously incompetent and incapable, in my view, of world leadership.”

“And if we give Donald Trump four more years, we’ll have a great deal of difficulty of ever being able to recover America’s standing in the world, and our capacity to bring nations together,” Biden says over images of himself with foreign leaders such as Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

In a Wednesday tweet, Trump defended his behavior at the summit, writing, “I got along great with the NATO leaders.”

“The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO,” Trump tweeted, adding that there was “only deep respect” for the United States.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2019

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, hit back at Biden over his own foreign policy credentials.

AD

“As the President has said, Joe Biden claims that foreign leaders have told him they want him to win the election. Of course they do,” Murtaugh wrote in an email to The Post. “They want to keep ripping off the United States like they did before Trump became President.”

The viral video from Buckingham Palace offered Biden a chance to highlight a regular theme from his campaign: emphasizing his foreign policy experience, while slamming Trump’s handling of global relations. In November, Biden’s campaign touted endorsements from 133 foreign policy experts and former officials who supported the former vice president as the “best antidote” to Trump, The Post’s Josh Rogin wrote. Days later, Biden accused Trump of “shredding our alliances” during an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon.

AD

At an event in Ames, Iowa, earlier on Wednesday, Biden had declined to directly attack Trump’s NATO performance, citing his stance that presidents shouldn’t be criticized while they are on foreign soil, WHO-DT reported. “What happened in the recent NATO conference has disturbed me. Really, really disturbed me,” he said.

AD

But less than an hour after Air Force One delivered Trump back to the U.S. on Wednesday night, Biden dropped his ad.

On social media, the video was met with mixed reactions. Some praised Biden’s team for creating what one person called “the best anti-Trump ad I’ve seen yet.” Others warned that the ad would only inspire a similar video from the Trump campaign centered on Biden’s numerous gaffes.

Viewers, however, did appear to largely agree on one thing: Trump would not be pleased.

“@realDonaldTrump is going to explode,” one person tweeted.

The ad marks the latest development in the story of several world leaders — including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, French president Emmanuel Macron, and British prime minister Boris Johnson — mocking Trump at a NATO summit this week. Trump called Trudeau two-faced when asked about the hot-mic moment. But he also said Trudeau is “a nice guy.”

The ad also includes video from a speech Trump gave to the United Nations in 2018. “In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,” Trump said, eliciting laughter from the crowd.

When Trump was running for president, he often spoke about the world laughing at the U.S. In fact, he’s been saying it for decades, according to the Washington Post, which found “103 times, going as far back as 1987” of Trump saying the U.S. is a global laughingstock. He was supposed to end that."

Joe Biden called an 83-year-old Iowa man a “damn liar” and challenged him to a push-up contest at a campaign stop Thursday. The tense exchange began with the man, who identified himself as a retired farmer, telling Biden he has two problems with him.

“You’re too old,” the man said, pointing out that he himself is 83 and doesn’t have the “mental faculties” he once did. (Biden is 77.) Then he moved on to Ukraine. “We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine, over there, pulling their foreign aid for them to say they’re going to investigate you,” he said.

“But you on the other hand, sent your son over there,” he continued. “You’re selling access to the president, just like he does.”

“You’re a damn liar, man,” said Biden, who had reason to object. The former VP has a record of pushing anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine and there’s no evidence he “sent” his son to Ukraine to sell access to President Obama. The two went back and forth for another 90 seconds, with Biden countering the man’s concerns over his age by challenging him to a push-up contest and an IQ test.

An NBC News reporter caught up with the man after the event and he refused to give his name. He also said he wants Biden to move aside for the next generation."

From the first:

“Men on board ship live in particularly close association; in their messes, one man sits beside another; their hammocks or bunks are close together; in their common tasks they work side by side; and in particular tasks such as those of a gun’s crew, they form a closely knit highly coordinated team.

“How many white men would choose, of their own accord, that their closest associates in sleeping quarters, at mess, and in a gun’s crew should be of another race? How many would accept such conditions, if required to do so, without resentment and just as a matter of course?”

These were not the musings of a member of the Ku Klux Klan, but the official statement of the chairman of the General Board of the Navy to the secretary of the Navy, Jan. 16, 1942. The subject: “Enlistment of men of colored race in other than messman branch.”

As to the question “how many white men would choose” associations with blacks, the General Board chairman said “the answer is ‘few, if any’ and . . . if the issue were forced, there would be a lowering of contentment, teamwork and discipline in the service.”

AD

That view prevailed until July 26, 1948, when President Harry S. Truman issued an executive order that led to the end of racial segregation in the armed forces.

AD

Then came this, 40 years after the Navy’s General Board spoke:

“Homosexuality is incompatible with military service. . . . The presence of such members adversely affects the ability of the Military Services to maintain discipline, good order, and morale; to foster mutual trust and confidence among servicemembers . . . to facilitate assignment and worldwide deployment of servicemembers who frequently must live and work under close conditions affording minimal privacy.” — Defense Department Directive 1332.14, Jan. 28, 1982.

AD

That pernicious Defense Department regulation against gays relied on the same stereotyping and myths that undergirded the military’s bias against African Americans.

The regulation was cited by U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch in his Dec. 9, 1991, decision to uphold the Navy’s right to expel a gay midshipman from the U.S. Naval Academy.

AD

The midshipman was within months of graduating in the top 10 percent of his class. He was on tap for a prestigious postgraduate assignment on a nuclear submarine. His talents as a singer enabled him to sing the national anthem before the Army-Navy game on nationwide TV during his senior year. He simply told a classmate he was gay. Once he said he was gay, he became unfit to associate with his classmates.

AD

The Defense Department was judging men and women not on the basis of their ability to perform as sailors, soldiers or Marines or serve in the Air Force, but solely because of a distinction that should have been irrelevant: race in the first case, sexual orientation in the second.

In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a measure allowing gays to serve openly in the military.

Last year, President Trump imposed policies restricting Obama’s 2016 directive allowing transgender service members to serve openly.

Simply stated, LGBTQ discrimination keeps close company with racism.

So, yes, because I have been and am on the receiving end of racial prejudice, I can relate to others who fall victim to bigotry.

That may explain why I share, in a special way, the revulsion, pain and anger felt by many Jewish community members over the profane and viciously anti-Semitic seven-second Snapchat video recently recorded by two George Washington University students.

And why I recoil at the sight of torch-wielding white nationalists in Charlottesville marching and chanting “Jews will not replace us.” Change one word, and they are railing against me.

Eyes that glare at the sight of a hijab or turban or a brown migrant worker get just as irritated when someone looking like me enters the room. I know what hostile stares feel like.

It’s interesting to recall that just over two months ago there was speculation that Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign might be finished. After the natural initial fears faded, nobody really thought his heart attack would keep him from staying in the race. But the general feeling outside his own camp was that it was a potential coup de grace for an already-struggling campaign that had lost a lot of its mojo to the high-flying Elizabeth Warren.

Instead, Sanders has hung in there and improved his relative position even as Warren has lost altitude. And as pundits have come back around to examining his base of support, many have come to realize something about it that is somewhat different and quite important, as Ron Brownstein reports:

[T]here are signs Hispanics may prove a kind of secret weapon for Sanders. In a recent Fox News poll of Nevada, Hispanics there preferred Sanders over Biden by 7 percentage points. Sanders also led Biden with them by 9 points in a recent Latino Decisions poll of California and doubled the former vice president’s vote among them in the University of Texas at Tyler poll. Sanders narrowly led Biden with Hispanics in a New York Times/Siena poll of Florida, and the two ran even in Arizona, according to the OH Predictive Insights survey.

The evidence of Sanders’s strength among Latinos is everywhere, most recently in a University of California IGS survey of the Golden State, where Sanders led the field, in no small part because of his 32 percent showing (Biden is second at 19 percent) among Latinos.

Brownstein notes that Sanders did well among younger Latinos in 2016, but quotes his pollster to the effect that Bernie is now exhibiting “more appeal across generations” in this demographic group. Perhaps — though cross tabs from Morning Consult’s most recent tracking poll show Sanders leading Biden 40/16 (with Warren at 11) among under-35 Latinos and 24/18 (with Warren at 16) among Latinos aged 34–44. But among Latinos aged 45–65, Biden leads Sanders 35/16 (Warren is at 12) and among Latino seniors Biden’s lead balloons to 45/10 (with Warren at 9). Sanders has an overall 29/23 lead over Biden (with Warren at 12) in this demographic because Latinos are an unusually young ethnic group.

The age factor is also critical to Sanders’s solid if less-powerful positioning among African-American voters, too. According to Morning Consult, Bernie is leading Joe Biden among under-30 black voters by a 41/23 margin. But at the other end of the age spectrum, among black seniors, Biden trounces Sanders 61/6.

As I noted recently, Sanders and Biden have joined Andrew Yang and Julian Castro as the remaining candidates who are drawing more support from nonwhite than white voters (by contrast, according to CNN data, Warren’s white/nonwhite percentages are at 17/9, and Pete Buttigieg’s are at 17/4). As the nomination contest calendar moves to more diverse states after New Hampshire, this dimension of their electoral bases could help them rebound from losses to Warren and/or Buttigieg in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire."

During initial intra-Republican discussions of a possible Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the president reportedly favored quick disposal of articles of impeachment by an immediate motion to dismiss. When Republican senators objected to that idea on grounds that it looked like they weren’t taking their constitutional duties seriously, the White House agreed to compromise last month, according to the Washington Post:

A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks …

Even a two-week trial could run counter to what Trump has expressed privately. The president is “miserable” about the impeachment inquiry and has pushed to dismiss the proceedings right away, according to people familiar with his sentiments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump’s views.

But now there are signs that the worm has really turned, and Trump is interested in putting on a show in the Senate designed not only to defend himself but to torment his enemies, as CNN is reporting:

Trump, who as recently as Wednesday lamented impeachment as a “dirty word,” has struggled to accept the prospect of becoming the third President in history to be impeached. But the President and White House officials are now signaling they will mount a robust defense in the Senate and look to turn the tables on Democrats during the President’s trial — including by digging in on the President’s unsubstantiated claims of corruption leveled at former Vice President Joe Biden.

It seems as if the president had a conversion experience while watching yesterday’s Judiciary Committee hearing on Air Force One.

On the flight home, with the TVs tuned to the hearing, the President praised the Republican questioning of the constitutional scholars who testified on Wednesday and coordinated the White House’s forceful response to one of the witnesses invoking his 13-year-old son’s name ….

“If you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning … “We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is.”

Can Trump and his allies essentially pull off repurposing the Senate trial into a show trial of his own devising? Perhaps to some extent, though it’s important to understand that neither the Constitution nor the standing Senate rules predetermine the scope of the trial, the witnesses each party (i.e., the House “impeachment managers” and the president or his legal counsel) can call, and the rules of evidence governing admissible matters. As a practical manner, the Senate sets its own rules on such details, and unless the two parties can cut a consensus deal (as semi-miraculously occurred before Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial), that means 51 senators can dictate them. There are currently 53 Republican senators.

Once these rules are adopted, Chief Justice John Roberts, who according to the Constitution will be sworn in as the chief presiding officer (but not the “judge” — the Senate itself is the judge and the jury), can rule on matters of procedure and evidence, but can also be overruled by 51 senators at any time. What will not be in play are the normal rules of evidence in criminal and civil trials; impeachment trials are their own beast, as Lawfare recently observed:

[T]he rules present a series of detailed stage directions for the initiation of the trial process, but these details don’t have a lot of substantive implications for the progression of the trial. And where things turn substantive, they also turn vague, putting a great many important questions in the hands of the chief justice and whatever constellation of at least 51 senators can get together in coalition on any given matter.

If Republicans do dictate the trial’s ad hoc rules, there’s not much question Trump’s attorneys will want to call witnesses relevant to their client’s claim that he was legitimately seeking to root out corruption in Ukraine, not trying to damage Joe Biden — a claim that could of course, if repeated and/or documented in an insanely high-profile impeachment trial, damage Joe Biden as much as anything the Ukrainians might have said or done as a “favor” to the president. Trump’s threat to drag his House Democratic tormenters like Pelosi and Schiff into the Senate dock is much more of a reach, but again, if 51 senators pretend to agree such testimony is relevant, it could happen. Meanwhile House managers will undoubtedly want to call in those witnesses Trump blocked from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, but they might be blocked from doing so by those same 51 senators.

One wild card is how much (if any) value Trump and McConnell place on tying up the five remaining Democratic senators who are running for president in a six-day-a-week trial when they really want to be on the campaign trail. But if the trial turns out to be must-see TV for MAGA types and allows their hero to claim vindication, it could be like those Soviet show trials that Stalin held to amuse himself and intimidate actual and potential enemies. Perhaps his friend, the former KGB operative Vladimir Putin, could give him pointers."

Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images

The official House Republican impeachment report is dedicated to nitpicking the vast evidence of misconduct against President Trump, and wedging a handful of available facts into an alternative frame. President Trump, argues the report, “holds a deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption.” Trump wasn’t trading favorable policy for particular investigations, Republicans insist. He just wanted to be sure the country had cleaned up its act before he sent them a check.

Meanwhile, at this very moment, Rudy Giuliani is back in Ukraine, blowing that defense to smithereens.

Giuliani — who, incredibly, still represents Trump as an “attorney” despite being the reported target of an increasingly dire criminal investigation — is continuing the same work he’s been undertaking on Trump’s behalf for two years. The House Republican line is that Trump wasn’t trying to order up dirt that would discredit the Mueller investigation and the Bidens. No, he was just really serious about corruption. Yet Giuliani is meeting with various Ukrainians “as part of his investigation into the Bidens and his bid to undercut the credibility of the impeachment investigation.”

This fact isn’t being dug up by hostile reporters against Giuliani’s wishes. He is literally broadcasting it. Last night he tweeted, “The conversation about corruption in Ukraine was based on compelling evidence of criminal conduct by then VP Biden, in 2016, that has not been resolved and until it is will be a major obstacle to the US assisting Ukraine with its anti-corruption reforms.”

...to the US assisting Ukraine with its anti-corruption reforms.



The American people will learn that Biden & other Obama administration officials, contributed to the increased level of corruption in Ukraine between 2014 to 2016.



This evidence will all be released very soon. — Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) December 5, 2019

Giuliani is saying out loud that corruption (1) specifically means Joe Biden, and (2) Ukraine must satisfy Giuliani and Trump by investigating it in order to get “assistance” from the United States. He is literally tweeting out the quid pro quo.

And lest there be any ambiguity as to whether Giuliani is speaking on Trump’s behalf, he has dispelled it. Giuliani called his trip “work being done by a lawyer defending his client” to the Daily Beast, and tells the right-wing news network OANN: “The president of the United States, I can tell you this, is asking for this.”

The Republican argument insists that Trump held up military aid and a presidential meeting in order to vouchsafe that the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, was really serious about ending corruption. “The Ukrainian government considered issuing a public anti-corruption statement to convey that President Zelensky was ‘serious and different’ from previous Ukrainian regimes,” argues the report. And once Trump was assured Zelensky really had broken from Ukraine’s corrupt old ways, he released the military aid.

So … since Ukraine apparently satisfied Trump’s concerns, why is Rudy there at all now?

Indeed, at this moment, Giuliani is palling around with some of the most corrupt Ukrainians from the old regime. Giuliani held a confab yesterday with pro-Russian Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach, a former member of the Party of Regions, which was deposed in a popular uprising against its extravagant corruption:

Photo: Andriy Derkach/Facebook

Giuliani is also meeting with Kostyantyn Kulyk, Yuriy Lutsenko, and Viktor Shokin, three notoriously corrupt Ukrainian officials.

It’s long been perfectly obvious that Trump has not only no interest in reducing Ukrainian corruption, but an active interest in reviving it. Still, Giuliani seems intent on snatching away whatever fig leaf Trump’s allies have tried to maintain. That Zelensky is serious and different from previous regimes is exactly what Trump and Giuliani are afraid of.

And finally, the House Republican report takes great pains to insist Giuliani’s contacts with Ukraine were specifically requested by the latter, not foisted upon it. “President Zelensky did not express any concern about Mayor Giuliani’s engagement — in fact, President Zelensky, not President Trump, first referenced Mayor Giuliani in the conversation,” argues the report, “Evidence shows that the Ukrainian government, and specifically Zelensky adviser Andrey Yermak, initiated contact with Mayor Giuliani — and not the other way around.” Therefore, Republicans suggest, Giuliani (and his shady Russian partners, Parnas and Fruman) provided a welcome service to Zelensky, rather than shaking him down for political favors.

And yet here we have the Ukrainian government openly saying they do not want Giuliani in their country. “An official in Zelensky’s office said the president was caught off guard by Giuliani’s arrival, learning about it from the media,” reports BuzzFeed, “The official emphasized that there are ‘no official meetings’ planned with him.”

The headline on ABC’s report on the trip reads, “Giuliani in Ukraine with conservative news outlet in effort to discredit impeachment probe.” The only impeachment report Giuliani is discrediting is the Republican one. He’s vindicating the Democratic impeachment report.

Trump has openly said he has an “absolute right” to demand any country investigate anybody he doesn’t like for any reason of his choosing. He’s not even bothering to pause briefly for impeachment to end before he resumes. If Republicans allow him to stay in office, he will simply keep doing the same thing over and over, and they will have given him permission to do so."

The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet Monday for presentations on Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine from lawyers for the Intelligence Committee. Here’s a guide to how impeachment works.

How we got here: A whistleblower complaint led Pelosi to announce the beginning of an official inquiry on Sept. 24. Closed-door hearings and subpoenaed documents related to the president’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky followed. After two weeks of public hearings in November, the House Intelligence Committee wrote a report that was sent to the House Judiciary Committee.

248,Paul Waldman,"It would be a shock, because it would violate the rule which says that Democrats (and only Democrats) must at the very least pay lip service to bipartisanship. But why should they?

But why should they?

This is brought to mind by an interview that Joe Biden gave to CNBC’s John Harwood about his economic plans. Biden, who just released a surprisingly liberal tax plan, has many of the right impulses, but they’re undermined by a bizarre blindness to the history he himself lived through and a complete misunderstanding of how today’s Republican Party operates.

AD

AD

Let’s begin here:

Harwood: But to the point about not your father’s Republican Party, some of the things on your tax and spending agenda are things that Republicans blocked when you were the vice president, before Trump. Biden: Yes, I agree. But now we’ve had Trump. There’s two ways people get inspired, John. They get inspired by inspirational people like John Kennedy and they get inspired by very bad people, bad presidents like Donald Trump. And what people have now seen is that his tax policy has been a disaster for the middle-class, disaster for them, and that there is plenty of room to be able to do things that make a lot of sense.

Biden has talked many times about how once Trump is gone, Republicans will shake their heads as if waking from a dream, then become much more reasonable. But here he’s going farther, not just saying they’ll ditch Trumpism, but that they’ll actually support progressive legislation on taxes.

At another point, Biden mentions changes he’d like to make to the tax code, including eliminating the “stepped-up basis” loophole, which allows those who inherit large assets like stock and property to pay very little in taxes. Then comes this:

Harwood: That’s one of the things that you guys tried and couldn’t do under Obama. Biden: No, but we can now. Once the carny show comes through — with the guy with the pea in the shell, three shells and there’s no pea under any shell — the second time it comes around, they figure it out.

Getting rid of that loophole is an excellent progressive idea. But the reason it didn’t happen under Barack Obama is because elected Republicans have an agenda — cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations — that they pursue relentlessly even though it’s incredibly unpopular. They do it because they believe in it, not because they think it’s to their political advantage.

AD

AD

So the reason Obama couldn’t get rid of the stepped-up basis loophole was that Republicans in Congress wanted to keep it. If they retain control of the Senate in a Biden presidency, the loophole will remain.

Later in the interview, Biden mentions his proposal to limit the total amount of deductions the wealthy can take. “Another thing Obama tried to do, couldn’t get done,” Harwood says.

“But we’ll get it done,” Biden replies. “Because things have changed.”

But what exactly does he think has changed? Are Republicans in Congress more amenable to progressive tax legislation now than they were five years ago?

Of course not. Biden keeps citing evidence that Republican tax policies haven’t produced the effects they predicted, which is perfectly true, but he insists that now everyone realizes it, so we can finally get Republicans to support a more progressive economic agenda.

AD

AD

The trouble is that the Republican belief in the importance of giving tax cuts to rich people isn’t susceptible to refutation by facts and evidence because it isn’t based on facts and evidence. It comes from a moral judgment they make, that money is a measure of virtue, and therefore the rich — The successful! The job creators! — deserve to pay as little in taxes as possible. That will not change.

Biden seems to think the GOP’s immunity to rational argument just began in 2016. But we’ve been talking about the bogusness of trickle-down economics since the 1980s. Biden was there when Republicans said Reagan’s tax cuts would pay for themselves and bring prosperity to all, and when they said the same thing about George W. Bush’s tax cuts. They were wrong, but they didn’t care.

There’s simply no way Biden doesn’t realize that. Which suggests he sees value in saying that he still might be able to win over some Republicans to his agenda with enough attempts at persuasion and magnanimous good will.

AD

AD

But what is the evidence for that belief? The theory was thoroughly tested in the Obama years, and the results were conclusive. Making a big show of reaching out to the other side doesn’t win you any substantive concessions. If anything it has the opposite effect, since you end up compromising on the front end to show your sincerity, but it wins you no votes in the end.

Being seen as the bigger person doesn’t get you any political benefit, either. Obama’s politeness and efforts to court Republicans didn’t stop them from winning sweeping victories in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections (though he did win reelection in 2012). Throughout it all, their venomous hatred of him only grew more intense.

Can anyone point to some outcome that was better for Democrats than it would otherwise have been because Obama made a show of reaching out to Republicans?

AD

AD

To be clear, there’s value in reaching out to voters who may have voted for Republicans in the past. Some of them may be receptive to arguments about the failure of Republican economics. But there’s absolutely no reason for Democrats to pretend that Republicans in Congress will ever be receptive to any argument a Democratic president makes.

They certainly aren’t going to abandon policy positions they’ve held for decades just because a Democrat treats them as though they deserve respect. It would be nice to know that the next Democratic president understands that.

“You’re damn near as old as I am,” he told the former vice president. “You’re too old for the job. I’m 83, and I know damn well I don’t have the mental faculties I did 30 years ago.”

AD

Continuing to pick apart Biden’s campaign, the man said: You “sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas or nothing, to get access to the president.”

AD

“You’re selling access to the president, just like he was,” the voter added.

Biden called the voter “a damn liar” before moving closer to the man to continue pushing back on his accusations.

“And you want to check my shape, man, let’s do push-ups together here, man,” the former lawmaker said. “Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. Okay?”

This is not the first time Biden used language to communicate that he was stronger, tougher and more of a fighter than someone opposing him politically. In March 2018, the University of Miami College Democrats posted a video of Biden saying he would have wanted to fight President Trump in high school.

AD

“When a guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, ‘I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it’ and then said, ‘I made a mistake,’ ” Biden said according to the video posted on Facebook.

AD

“They asked me would I like to debate this gentleman, and I said, ‘No,’ ” he added. “I said, ‘If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.’""

When some of Biden’s competitors have shown aggression over policy issues, pundits criticized them and voters may have penalized them for it.

When former housing secretary Julián Castro went after Biden in a September debate for appearing not to remember a recent remark he made, Castro was called mean for appearing to make a jab at Biden’s age — especially after fact-checkers at The Post noted that Castro was incorrect when trying to explain the differences between the two candidates’ health-care plans.

AD

“It was a callow, nasty moment in a race in which many Democrats have been pleading with candidates not to attack one another,” wrote The Post’s Jennifer Rubin. “Everyone else seems to get it, but not Castro.”

AD

And according to those on the ground in Iowa, Castro is viewed by some voters in the state — many of them older and white — as angry when he goes after his opponents.

Explaining the preferences of older Iowa voters, Art Cullen, editor of the Storm Lake Times in northwestern Iowa, told the New York Times last month: “Castro kind of comes off with fangs every now and again.”

And when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) zeroed in on Biden early in the debates over his past policies on busing and the impact it had on children of color, she was penalized by some voters who deemed her approach too aggressive. After she ended her campaign, author and professor Howard Fineman cited the July incident, suggesting it contributed to her unpopularity with voters.

AD

“Another lesson from the demise of Kamala Harris: among voters who are Democrats, you don’t have to support Joe Biden, or even like him, but don’t attack him directly, especially face-to-face,” he tweeted Tuesday. “People are sort of fond of the old dude.”

AD

But the extent to which fondness manifests as privilege is another layer of the drawn-out conversation about “electability” and who is deemed presidential and not. Studies have shown that when women and people of color are confrontational in the workplace, they are penalized.

A 2008 Harvard study examining gender and emotion is expressed in the workplace found:

Displays of anger from men are often viewed as a response to external circumstances, (i.e. they were provoked), while displays of anger by women are more likely to be seen as an internal trait (I.e. she is an angry person).

In fact, one of Biden’s attacks against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.), the highest-polling woman in the presidential race, was that her critiques of his policy come from a place of anger — a description many critics viewed as highly gendered.

AD

After Warren suggested that Biden’s politics were too conservative for today’s Democratic Party, he wrote in a Medium post: “These kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.”

AD

And Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, found that black professionals often had to police their own emotions in the workplace out of fear of professional consequences. She previously wrote in the Atlantic:

In particular, black professionals had to be very careful to show feelings of conviviality and pleasantness, even — especially — in response to racial issues. They felt that emotions of anger, frustration, and annoyance were discouraged, even when they worked in settings where these emotions were generally welcomed in certain contexts — think litigators interacting with opposing counsel, or financial analysts responding to a stressful day on Wall Street. Interestingly, this often played out at trainings meant to encourage racial sensitivity.

Some defenders of Biden's interaction with the Iowa farmer — and even Warren — might argue that the former vice president was responding to unfair and inaccurate attacks. And as a result, he has a right to be angry and to respond as such. There's an idea that a “tough guy” is needed to defeat Trump.

AD

But the question to be considered on this issue is: Do other candidates get that same right? Would Harris be allowed to get in a voter’s face and call him a liar without consequence? Or would Castro be allowed to brag that he’d punch the president in the face and maintain his standing, were he a front-runner?

AD

Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 rival, certainly wasn’t allowed to appear angry without attracting criticism. After a debate, former GOP chairman Reince Priebus called her out on it on Twitter.

@HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time - no smile and uncomfortable - upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets. — Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016

These candidates are applying for a job. They hope to replace a president who many voters believe misbehaves in ways that his predecessor — America’s first black president — or his general-election opponent, the first woman to become a major party’s presidential nominee, never could.

This tells us a great deal about the state of the Democratic Party and how it has affected Biden, who is assumed to be the ideologically moderate choice for president (along with other candidates, including Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar). The plan’s main features:

AD

End the preferential treatment of investment income for those making more than $1 million a year. Right now, you pay higher taxes on wage income (money you get by working) than on investment income (money you get when your money makes you more money). Biden’s plan would tax all that income the same for the extremely wealthy.

Raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.

End the “stepped-up basis rule” that allows people who inherit stocks and property to pay little or no taxes on those assets.

Institute a 15 percent minimum corporate tax, to prevent corporations from using loopholes to reduce their tax bills to nothing.

Raise the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent, where it was before the Trump tax cuts.

Cap the amount of deductions the wealthy can take.

There are a few other proposals (here’s a good rundown), but those are the most significant ones. It’s true that it doesn’t contain the kind of wealth tax that Warren and Sanders have proposed. And as Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute pointed out to me, it does accept some features of the Obama-era tax code as the limits of what you can do, like precisely a 39.6 percent top rate (when he could have proposed 40 percent or 50 percent).

But in other ways, Bivens noted, “It’s a far more ambitious plan than anything even the Obama aspirational budgets,” the yearly President’s Budget released by the White House, proposed.

AD

Which tells us that the “moderate” position on taxes, as on other issues, has moved significantly to the left.

You can make a direct comparison with health care. When Biden was vice president, single-payer health care was considered something of a fringe idea in the Democratic Party, advocated by people like Sanders but not taken too seriously. Then it moved to the heart of the party’s debate on health care, the result of which was that a robust public option became the moderate position.

AD

Today, many on the left view a public option as a sellout, even though the one advocated by (among others) Biden is far more progressive than the Affordable Care Act, potentially giving tens of millions of Americans the protection of government health insurance and making single-payer in the future far more likely.

AD

This tax plan is very similar. In fact, it’s a combination of proposals that Obama never even considered and things that at various times he put in budget proposals but knew would never find their way into law because Republicans controlled one or both houses of Congress.

So ideas such as equalizing taxes between wage and investment income (which I’ve been shouting about for years) or eliminating the stepped-up basis loophole were suggested by Obama, but without any illusions that they would become law. Now they’re in Biden’s campaign tax plan, which will necessarily be the starting point for legislation if he becomes president. That brings them a giant step closer to reality.

AD

The entire atmosphere has changed. I also spoke to Jared Bernstein, who was Biden’s chief economic adviser when he was vice president. (Bernstein did not have any role in crafting this plan.) He argued that in part because of a reaction to increasing regressive Republican tax policies and in part because of the prominence of more ambitious proposals such as a wealth tax, ideas about what Democrats should or can do have shifted to the left.

AD

So a reasonably progressive plan like this one would be able to pass through Congress if Democrats took control, which means winning the support of the most conservative Democratic senators, like Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema.

“When I go through this list,” Bernstein said, “I see a lot of stuff that I think the marginal Democratic senator would be okay with.”

AD

The “moderate” position on taxes among Democrats has now become not only increasing them on the wealthy, but also doing in ways that could make the tax system substantially more fair and provide significant funding for social programs — ways that were considered pipe dreams just a few years ago. Even if you think Biden’s plan doesn’t go far enough, that’s reason to be pleased.

Shortly before 5 p.m. on November 15, Attorney General William P. Barr arrived at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., his owlish face wearing a heavy expression. He and his entourage rushed by the lobby bar, where a television was tuned to CNN’s coverage of another day of damning impeachment hearings and raging presidential tweets. Inside a gilded ballroom, hundreds of conservative lawyers — many of them, like Barr, veterans of previous Republican administrations — were gathered to hear him deliver an address to the annual conference of the Federalist Society. “It will come as little surprise to this group,” Barr began, “that I’ve chosen to speak about the Constitution’s approach to executive power.” Even by the standards of this brazen era in Washington, in which all subtext is banished, the theme of the evening was a little on-the-nose — a startlingly explicit case for strengthening Donald Trump’s hold on American government.

“The grammar-school-civics-class version of our Revolution is that it was a rebellion against monarchical tyranny, and that in framing our Constitution, one of the preoccupations, the main preoccupation of the Founders, was to keep the executive weak,” Barr told the audience. “This is misguided.” Instead, Barr advocates for what is known as the “unitary executive theory,” which challenges the long-established doctrine that the president’s control over his branch of government is shared, to some degree, with Congress and the courts. “Whenever I see a court opinion that uses the word share,” Barr said, “I want to run in the other direction.” Critics say that in its maximalist form, the theory is a license for authoritarianism — a concern that Barr dismissed with ridicule.

“One of the more amusing aspects of modern progressive polemic is their breathless attacks on the unitary executive theory,” Barr said. He paused for effect, waved his arms, and shouted ghoulishly: “Bwaaaaaaaaaa!” He recounted his own confirmation hearing, at which Democratic senators pressed him to explain his muscular philosophy. “This is not ‘new,’ and it’s not a ‘theory,’” Barr said. If anything, he argued, the president’s rightful power had been stolen, a view shaped by his personal history. Barr started his career as a CIA analyst in 1973 in the midst of Watergate. At the time, the Agency was besieged by revelations of its misdeeds, congressional investigations, and political battles over regulation of intelligence activities. But where others saw the post-Watergate reforms as a triumph of accountability, Barr viewed them as the beginning of a constitutional wrong turn. At the Mayflower, he spoke of the “steady grinding down of the executive branch’s authority that accelerated after Watergate,” now exacerbated by partisan conflict.

“Immediately after President Trump won election, opponents inaugurated what they called the resistance,” Barr said. “They rallied around an explicit strategy of using every tool and maneuver to sabotage the functioning of the executive branch and his administration. Now, ‘resistance’ is the language used to describe insurgency against rule imposed by an occupying military power. It obviously connotes that the government is not legitimate. This is a very dangerous and indeed incendiary notion to import into the politics of a democratic republic.” Without mentioning the impeachment hearings, Barr accused Democrats in Congress of using “constant harassment” to “incapacitate the executive branch” and the administration’s agenda. Those who accused Trump of acting like an anti-democratic menace, Barr said, had it backward. “In waging a scorched-earth, no-holds-barred war of resistance against this administration,” he said, “it is the left that is engaged in a systematic shredding of norms and undermining the rule of law.”

Barr’s message was met with applause in the room and a savage reaction outside it. On social media, liberal commentators howled in protest, while his most important audience, @realDonaldTrump, retweeted a video clip of his attack on the resistance. A few days afterward, Checks and Balances, a group of conservative lawyers and scholars who oppose Trump, issued a statement calling his “autocratic vision” ahistorical and contrary to the Constitution. Barr was untroubled.

“Generally, no one really cares what they think,” Barr said of the Checks and Balances crowd when we met the week of Thanksgiving amid the wood-paneled grandeur of his office suite on the fifth floor of the Justice Department headquarters. In person, on a darkening fall afternoon, the 69-year-old was subdued, his voice softened almost to a mumble. Barr claims to ignore the newspapers and social media, and whether that is entirely true, he certainly occupies his position with a comfort that eluded his immediate predecessor, Jeff Sessions. Barr knew the office well, having served as attorney general once before during the presidency of George H.W. Bush. He said he returned to government, after nearly 30 years, with the objective of restoring order.

“People who had a lot of antipathy toward Trump seemed to be willing to go to any lengths to injure his administration,” Barr said. “I felt that was unfair and harmful to the system and important institutions, including the presidency, and I felt there should be people in the Department of Justice to help navigate through these times.”

As attorney general, Barr is at once the nation’s chief prosecutor and the president’s highest-ranking legal counselor, an inherently conflicted role when the president is accused of wrongdoing. But over the past year, with bureaucratic dexterity and bluff self-assurance, Barr has effectively turned the Justice Department to face down Trump’s adversaries. In the spring, he brought a muffled conclusion to special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, managing the release of his report in a way that limited its impact and declaring the evidence did not show Trump committed obstruction of justice. Barr then initiated a secretive internal probe of the origins of the Russia investigation, headed by veteran prosecutor John Durham, who is scrutinizing the FBI and CIA. Barr, who claims there was “spying” on Trump’s campaign, has played a hands-on role in Durham’s work, traveling the world to convince foreign intelligence services to cooperate in his investigation of the investigation.

His performance appears to have earned Trump’s confidence to a rare degree. In the phone call with Ukraine’s president that set off impeachment, the president mentioned Barr in the same breath as his attorney Rudy Giuliani. Barr was reportedly angry when he heard about the call, though, and in fairness, he is nobody’s personal fixer. Rather, Barr is an intimidatingly competent governmental operator — a man who “knows the levers,” as one former Trump-administration Justice official put it. A better comparison, often made by Barr’s peers, is to Dick Cheney. Barr appreciates power, and he knows how to wield it.

As the Durham probe, the ongoing impeachment drama, and the presidential campaign play out in the coming months, Barr will occupy a crucial position. While crowds chant “Lock her up” and “Lock him up,” he holds the keys to the prying powers of law enforcement. To give just one example, Barr is ultimately overseeing the investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan that is reportedly zeroing in on Giuliani and his efforts to dig dirt and do business in Ukraine. He will potentially have a say when the president decides whether to pardon convicted associates like Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Presuming he remains in the president’s favor — never a sure bet — he will be advising Trump through a reelection year that is certain to revolve around allegations of Trump’s corruption. Barr’s analysis of Trump’s presidency is right in at least one respect: As much as the president likes to play autocrat on Twitter, hurling orders and threatening his enemies, so far, he has actually been quite weak — constrained by Congress, the courts, protests, and, often, his own administration’s incompetence. It is Barr who will be guiding him as he goes forward, determined to test the bounds of his power.

When Trump nominated Barr to be attorney general in December 2018, some foes of the president, glancing at Barr’s experience, his many personal connections to the Justice Department, and the array of former deputies and protégés he had seeded all over the Republican legal Establishment, jumped to the conclusion that he might prove to be a nuisance to the president. “All my friends, they projected their feelings onto Bill, believing him to be an institutionalist who would ‘stand up to Trump,’ ” says an academic who once worked with Barr. “I warned everybody: ‘Don’t do that.’ ”

In fact, Barr could hardly have been more explicit in indicating what he believed and what he would do when the president sent him to the Justice Department. “I think it started picking up after Watergate,” Barr said in a 2001 interview for a University of Virginia oral-history project on the first Bush administration, “the idea that the Department of Justice has to be ‘independent.’ ” Barr thinks it is not just impossible but undesirable for prosecutors to operate independently of politics. “Career people are just as capable of acting politically with a small p, and I think, at the end of the day, if you’re making a decision, it should be made by people who are accountable,” Barr told me. “Our system puts political appointees in that position. That’s why we have elections.” Barr has said that criminal investigations — especially the most important ones — require “political supervision,” and he has contended that the Constitution grants the president “illimitable” authority over law enforcement, even if it is scrutinizing the White House.

Like his boss, Barr is the product of a privileged New York upbringing — his father was a memorably authoritarian headmaster at Dalton — who rebelled against his hometown’s liberal culture. Not long after joining the CIA, Barr transferred to the Agency’s internal legal office and started taking law classes at night. He caught the eye of the then–CIA director, George H.W. Bush. Years later, as president, Bush gave Barr his first job at Justice, naming him to head the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). The office offers guidance on the legality of executive actions, which gives it great influence in government, especially in national-security matters. (A former head of the office once said its role was to “dispense get-out-of-jail-free cards.”)

At his Senate-confirmation hearing, in 1989, Barr described the formative effect of his CIA experience, while the then–Judiciary Committee chairman, Joe Biden, pressed the issue of his “independence.” Biden advised Barr to ignore the “pull and tug” of the Oval Office in forming his legal opinions and asked him about the “genius of the system of checks and balances.”

“It is a very broad issue, what are my views of the separation of powers,” Barr said.

“Start anywhere you like,” Biden replied.

“Well,” Barr said, “let us start with Aristotle.”

Barr went on to offer a pithy encapsulation of the history of representative government, touching on the Greeks, the Romans, and the Founders, before concluding with the observation that separation “doesn’t lead to the most efficient government, but over the long run the freest government.” For all his conciliatory intellectual rhetoric, though, Barr had been given a confrontational mission to expand presidential authority. “All of us, coming out of Watergate, felt that Congress had taken more than its proper share of power back,” says C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel at the time. He says he recommended Barr because he wanted an ally at the OLC who believed in the theory of the unitary executive.

Soon after Barr was confirmed, he issued a memorandum targeting a list of “encroachments” on executive authority, including the independent-counsel law, a post-Watergate reform that protected political investigations from interference. Barr disliked the law because he thought an independent prosecutor, with a single focus, could easily run rampant, pursuing phantom crimes. Even among Republicans who believed in a strong president, some of Barr’s positions were extreme. “Bill’s answer was uniformly that the president gets what he wants,” says Douglas Kmiec, Barr’s immediate OLC predecessor, who now teaches constitutional law at Pepperdine University. “I think a good number of us from OLC said, ‘Wait a minute.’ ”

Barr turned his small office into an ideological engine room staffed by like-minded young conservatives and fought internal battles with the more-moderate factions of the Bush administration. Some senior officials referred to Barr and his deputy as “the bulldogs.” Barr was known for his infinite confidence, but he occasionally outsmarted himself. Journalist Jan Crawford, in her book Supreme Conflict, writes that when a seat opened on the Supreme Court in 1990, OLC attorneys worked all night to prepare a memo that would sink the leading candidate, Kenneth Starr, a colleague Barr considered “maddeningly squishy.” The seat instead went to David Souter, the favorite of Bush’s chief of staff, who turned out to be a reliable liberal vote.

Barr impressed Bush, though, and after an unusually quick scramble up the rungs of the department, he was named attorney general in 1991 at the age of 41. His primary preoccupation was violent crime, which was then seen as an epidemic. Unlike many who come into the position, Barr had little previous experience with law enforcement, so he assembled a leadership team of seasoned prosecutors. The head of his criminal division was a square-jawed ex-Marine, Robert Mueller. Barr advocated punitive measures to fight gangs and gun offenses, and the department produced a report with the now-infamous title “The Case for More Incarceration.” His crime crackdown had bipartisan support. Barr and Biden cooperated. “I think it’s pretty fair to say that Bill charmed Joe Biden,” says Timothy Flanigan, who worked under Barr in the OLC. Biden invited the Barr family up to visit his home in Delaware.

Much of Barr’s tenure coincided with the 1992 election campaign. Like every attorney general, he faced decisions with political implications, and he was unapologetic about looking out for Bush’s interests. When a coup in Haiti caused throngs of refugees to flee in boats, Barr set a policy of intercepting them at sea and detaining them at Guantánamo Bay, outside the purview of U.S. immigration laws. The policy caused a clash with military leaders, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. In the oral-history interview, Barr said his attitude was: “You want 80,000 Haitians to descend on Florida several months before the election? Come on, give me a break.”

Bill Clinton ran on an economic message, but Bush would blame his defeat on a political investigation. On the Friday before the election, Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel probing the Iran-Contra scandal, issued an indictment that included new details about Bush’s role. The news dominated the last days of the race. “Walsh abused his power!” Bush complained to Barr the day after the election, according to Bob Woodward’s book Shadow. On his way out of office, Bush wanted to put an end to the long-running investigation. Under the independent-counsel statute, Walsh could be fired for misconduct, a move Barr considered. But he and Bush settled on another solution. Bush simply pardoned all the Iran-Contra defendants.

In the final stage of the campaign, Barr was presented with an opportunity to exercise the kind of political supervision he believed prosecutors required. On a flight to a ceremony with other administration officials, a White House aide informed him, cryptically, of a rumor about a case down in Arkansas involving a savings-and-loan and Bill Clinton. Barr did some digging and discovered that the U.S. Attorney in Little Rock was sitting on a criminal referral that mentioned Clinton and a failed real-estate venture called the Whitewater Development Corporation. The prosecutor, a Republican, found the case flimsy, and the referral described Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses, not suspects. But Barr had been told that the prosecutor’s conclusion was “cutting them a lot of slack,” he later testified in a deposition, and he decided to “get the case on the right track” by escalating it to Washington. Mueller held a meeting with FBI officials and told them to investigate aggressively, just as in any other bank-fraud case. The Arkansas prosecutor fired off an angry letter, saying the “insistence for urgency” suggested an “attempt to intervene into the political process of the upcoming presidential election.”

Barr dictated that the investigation would proceed, but in secret, so as not to interfere with the election. “Later, a number of Republicans said, ‘Well, hell, why didn’t you? You would’ve saved the country,’ ” Barr told me. He laughed, since we both knew how the story ended for Clinton. With the complaint revived, the FBI continued to investigate the Whitewater case after Barr was gone. Political investigations burn on a long fuse. An independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, took over the inquiry, and it went in unanticipated directions.

Just one year ago, Barr was semi-retired and semi-obscure, practicing law in Washington and living in McLean, Virginia, the deep state’s suburban home. After his relatively brief stint as attorney general ended with Bush’s defeat, he left government at an age young enough to embark on a whole second career. He became general counsel at a small telephone company, GTE, which he helped to guide through a series of mergers and acquisitions as it morphed into Verizon. He gained deep knowledge of regulation and antitrust law and made a considerable fortune. (Forbes has estimated his net worth at $40 million.) In 2008, Barr took an early retirement from Verizon and went on to a comfortable position at a prominent Washington law firm.

All three of his daughters, who attended his first Senate-confirmation hearing in their Sunday best, grew up to be government lawyers, and two of them have worked for the Justice Department. (So have two of his sons-in-law.) Barr himself never completely left the orbit of the department. He still socialized with old colleagues, like Mueller and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who often attended the Barr family’s Scottish-themed Christmas parties. (Barr likes to play the bagpipes.) Barr sometimes called up to offer input to his successors. After 9/11, for instance, Barr suggested the idea of using military commissions to try captured terrorists.

Barr supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 primaries, but unlike many of his contemporaries, he never voiced opposition to Trump. However, he did watch, with growing horror, as the result of the election threw the Justice Department into disarray. Democrats blamed FBI director James Comey for sinking Hillary Clinton’s presidential run, in part, by mishandling the FBI’s investigation into her emails. Meanwhile, in secret, the Bureau had launched a counterintelligence investigation, code-named “Crossfire Hurricane,” into suspected Russian attempts to swing the campaign for Trump. When that news broke after Trump’s election, some in Barr’s world of Justice Department alumni were troubled by the prospect — however remote — that Trump might be a Russian tool. But Barr’s faction of the community was pulsing with an alternative set of suspicions, focusing on the motives of those who initiated the investigation.

“It was apparent to all of us that there was a ‘Get Trump’ attitude in the leadership of the FBI,” says George Terwilliger, a longtime friend of Barr’s who served as his deputy attorney general in the 1990s. During the early stages of Trump’s presidency, Terwilliger was speaking to Barr a few times a week. “I know he was extremely concerned,” Terwilliger says. They both saw evidence of political bias in disclosures about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two key figures in the FBI who were having an affair amid Crossfire Hurricane and exchanging anti-Trump text messages, which Barr has deemed “appalling.” And both found it suspicious that Comey and the FBI were relying on information gathered in the Steele dossier, which was funded by Trump’s political opponents.

In 2017, the Russia investigation appeared to pose a serious threat to Trump’s presidency. After Trump fired Comey, Mueller was appointed by the DOJ as special prosecutor. He spent the summer assembling an aggressive staff and issuing search warrants. Trump and his family sought to bolster the president’s defense team. They approached Barr through an intermediary, David Friedman — the former Trump bankruptcy attorney who is now the ambassador to Israel — and asked if he would be interested in joining. Barr declined. “I didn’t want to stick my head into that meat grinder,” Barr later testified. But he agreed to meet with Trump at the White House the next morning. In the Oval Office, Trump pressed Barr for his personal impressions of Mueller. “I told him how well I knew Bob Mueller and … the Barrs and Muellers were good friends and would be good friends when this is all over,” Barr testified. “Bob is a straight shooter and should be dealt with as such.”

Barr has made much of his personal relationship with Mueller, letting it be known that their wives attend Bible study together, and Mueller was a guest at two of his daughters’ weddings. It is a shield against any suggestion he would set out to undermine the investigation. But his full opinion of Mueller, according to people who know both men, is more complicated. Over their long relationship, Barr was always the alpha. Former colleagues say that while Barr respected Mueller, he saw him as an able prosecutor, not a brilliant legal mind. “I doubt it would be any surprise to Bill to learn or conclude that Bob’s staff was driving the train much more than Bob was,” said one person who has worked with both men. When Mueller was his subordinate in the 1990s, Barr would often subject him to intellectual hazing.

“Bill was always making fun of people in his meetings, and Mueller was a particular target of his fun,” recalls another former colleague. “Mueller would say things that were kind of stupid at times, and Bill would just mercilessly make fun of him.”

As the investigation developed, Barr grew convinced Mueller required guidance. News reports were hinting that the prosecutors were pursuing a theory that by firing Comey and publicly attacking the “witch hunt,” Trump had obstructed justice. Barr thought that Mueller’s “novel” obstruction theory, as he later described it, was a constitutionally dangerous path, and so on a snowy day in early 2018, he went to visit the DOJ’s headquarters, a monumental building known as Main Justice, to lunch with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Because Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation, Rosenstein had appointed Mueller and was responsible for overseeing his work. Like Sessions, Rosenstein had a tortured relationship with Trump. It was later reported that Rosenstein was so alarmed after Comey’s firing that he offered to wear a wire to a White House meeting. (There is dispute about whether he was joking.)

The two men ordered in Chinese food and discussed a variety of topics, including the Mueller investigation and its focus on Comey’s firing. Barr told Rosenstein it would be wrong and crippling to criminalize a president’s decisions to remove top officials, which were part of his constitutional duties. As he made his case, he recalled, Rosenstein was “sphinxlike in his reaction.” So Barr decided to follow up in writing.

Mueller would say things that were kind of stupid at times, and Bill would just mercilessly make fun of him.

Barr’s concerns about a politically unaccountable FBI have some historical grounding — think of J. Edgar Hoover, so feared he effectively had tenure for life. Barr later said he was afraid that Trump’s case could have “a chilling effect” on the president’s role in law enforcement. He put his thinking into a long memo, which he sent to Rosenstein and the head of the OLC. “I know you will agree that, if a DOJ investigation is going to take down a democratically elected president,” Barr wrote, “it is imperative to the health of our system and to our national cohesion that any claim of wrongdoing is solidly based on evidence of a real crime — not a debatable one.” He urged the officials not to “indulge the fancies by overly zealous prosecutors.”

Barr conceded that a president could obstruct justice through specific bad acts, like destroying evidence, but he said he otherwise had “necessarily all-encompassing” authority over law enforcement. “He alone is the Executive branch,” Barr wrote, citing a Supreme Court decision. “While the president has subordinates — the Attorney General and DOJ lawyers — who exercise prosecutorial discretion on his behalf, they are merely ‘his hand.’ ”

Barr wanted his message to reach Mueller, and he put it in many bottles. He shared the memo widely with Justice Department alumni, academics, and members of Trump’s legal team, which included Emmet Flood, the attorney who oversaw the final stages of the Mueller investigation inside the White House counsel’s office. When Sessions resigned that November, Flood advocated for Barr to be his replacement. “I think he presented himself to the president as the guy who could get it done,” says one former Trump-administration DOJ official, “and solve the problem that was confronting the president.”

While some have said his memo looked like a job application, Barr has called the suggestion “ludicrous.” Friends say he agreed to join the administration only reluctantly. The final push came at a retreat for a CIA advisory board he served on. “At that retreat,” Barr said, “there were a lot of Democratic businessmen and others, and they were talking about the importance of having the department in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing.” Still, many friends were surprised that he would expose himself to the daily animosity of politics, as well as the potential for humiliation by Trump, who ridiculed Sessions without mercy. On his first day on the job, at a Rose Garden ceremony where Trump signed an emergency declaration allowing him to build his border wall over congressional objections, the president singled out Barr and said, a tad ominously: “Enjoy your life.”

“He says that a lot,” Barr said with a grin.

Unlike Sessions, Barr commanded immediate respect at Main Justice, where his bureaucratic expertise allowed him to take control. Already, some of the initial chaos ushered in by Trump’s presidency had begun to subside, as conservative political appointees asserted themselves and many career attorneys who had joined during the Obama administration gave up and left. “As time progressed, loyalty became the dominant mentality,” says Erica Newland, an OLC attorney who quit shortly before Barr arrived. Barr’s department has pressed Trump’s policies on a variety of fronts, from immigration (for instance, by curtailing rights to asylum), to drugs (Barr’s daughter Mary headed the DOJ’s opioid enforcement initiative for a time), to technology (pressuring companies for backdoors to encryption), to crime. After nearly two decades, Barr resumed the use of the federal death penalty; the first execution is scheduled for December 9 (pending appeals). The department has fought subpoenas to reveal information about Trump’s tax returns and other politically charged issues.

Barr’s first order of business, though, was dealing with the Mueller report. When Barr finally had a chance to talk to Mueller, in March, he said he was surprised to learn the special counsel was coming to a non-decision on the obstruction issue. Mueller turned in his 448-page report soon afterward, presenting a highly damaging picture of Trump’s actions but declining to come to a “traditional prosecutorial judgment.” Barr temporarily withheld the report from Congress and the public, citing the need for careful redactions. Instead, he issued a short summary of Mueller’s findings, offering his own conclusion that the evidence of obstruction was “not sufficient” and eliding an — admittedly confusing — legal nuance. Because of an OLC opinion that said the president could not be indicted while in office, Mueller had reasoned that it would be unfair to accuse Trump of committing a crime with no opportunity to defend himself in court. He seemed to imply that it was up to Congress to indict him via impeachment.

Barr’s favorable summary met with protest from Democrats and recriminations from Mueller’s office, which complained that the report’s findings had been mischaracterized. (Barr later called Mueller’s reaction “a bit snitty” and blamed the special counsel’s staff.) But the whole controversy served to blunt the force of the full report when it arrived weeks later. A furious House Speaker Nancy Pelosi threatened to hold Barr in criminal contempt, claiming he had lied to Congress about his dealings with Mueller over the report. Barr laughed off both the allegation and the symbolic action. “Madam Speaker,” Barr asked when they encountered each other at a Capitol Hill ceremony soon afterward, “did you bring your handcuffs?”

Barr’s defenders say that he did eventually release the report, which was not legally required, and it is not his fault if the public didn’t read it or get outraged. In a final bid to galvanize public opinion, House Democrats summoned a reluctant Mueller to testify in July. But the hearings were an anticlimax, as Mueller seemed fumbling and uncertain under questioning. His old colleagues from the Justice Department, even ones who are critical of Barr, say they thought Mueller looked aged — not like the man they knew. Fairly or not, the shaky performance reinforced the rumors that the revered prosecutor, who is now 75, was not fully in control of his investigation.

“Bill Barr might have been the only person in the country conversant with how Bob would actually come across,” says Douglas Kmiec, who overlapped with both of them in the Justice Department 30 years ago. “The rest of us, without the same familiarity, kept seeing the same picture of Bob Mueller as the man of steel.”

The day after Mueller testified, Trump called the president of Ukraine, setting up the next episode in his police-procedural presidency. “That whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine,” Trump said, according to the reconstructed transcript. “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.” A great deal hinges on what the definition of the word it is. Trump seemed to be conflating two investigations: John Durham’s probe into the origins of the Russia investigation and Giuliani’s intrigues, focused on surfacing damaging information about Joe and Hunter Biden. The fact that Trump apparently saw them as a single agenda item may be careless talk or evidence of a deeper connection in his mind between the two efforts, both focused on his enemies.

“I’ve had zero conversation with Ukraine,” Barr told me, reaffirming a statement the Justice Department put out in September, which also said Trump had never brought up investigating Biden with Barr. The Justice Department played an important role, however, in the effort to keep the contents of the call from becoming public after the fact. In August, after the White House informed the department of the whistle-blower’s complaint, the OLC issued an opinion that said it could be withheld from Congress on the grounds that the applicable law did not cover presidential misconduct. The department also determined Trump had not broken campaign-finance laws. After the complaint came out, the Washington Post recently reported, Trump wanted his attorney general to go even further by holding a press conference to declare him innocent and was upset that Barr refused.

But Barr has extended himself to a surprising degree in chasing the president’s suspicions. In May, shortly after the Mueller report was released, he discounted its findings of extensive Russian efforts to contact and influence the Trump campaign. “There is no evidence of a conspiracy,” Barr told Jan Crawford in an in-depth interview for CBS News. “So it was bogus, this whole idea that Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus.” He blamed “a small group at the top” of the FBI and painted their actions in apocalyptic terms. “I mean, republics have fallen because of [a] Praetorian Guard mentality,” he said, “where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences, and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion is somehow an enemy of the state.” Crawford asked if the investigators’ actions in pursuing Crossfire Hurricane might amount to “treason,” the word Trump has used. Barr said only, “Not as a legal matter.”

The same month, Barr appointed Durham to investigate the investigation. The dimensions of what the prosecutor had been assigned to do were unclear, but as the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, Durham had no obvious political bias. He had served both Democratic and Republican presidents, prosecuting many tough mob and public-corruption cases, and had a reputation for extreme secrecy. During the Obama administration, he conducted a highly classified investigation of the CIA’s alleged use of torture. Over the past few months, Trump allies like Michael Mukasey, a former Republican attorney general whose official portrait hangs in Barr’s office, have fanned speculation that Durham is onto something. “He is an experienced and principled prosecutor,” Mukasey wrote in The Wall Street Journal in September. “Stay tuned.”

What could Durham be looking into? Barr initially questioned the evidence supporting the FBI’s secret warrant for electronic surveillance on Carter Page, the Trump campaign’s foreign-policy adviser, along with other unspecified breaks with “normal procedures” at the FBI. In May, he told CBS that he had asked questions about the FBI’s actions in 2016, and the answers he received were “just not jiving.” More recent indications suggest that the probe has since broadened in scope to examine not just the FBI but also the CIA. In late October, the New York Times reported that Durham’s work, originally classified vaguely as an “administrative review,” was now a criminal investigation, allowing him to issue subpoenas and convene a grand jury, a step that could be routine or something more.

In late September, as all of Washington was poring over the CIA whistle-blower’s complaint, Barr was in Rome, meeting with government counterparts, reportedly including the chief of Italy’s intelligence agency, to assure their cooperation with Durham. Barr has also sought assistance from Australia and Great Britain, and the department has said Durham talked to “certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government.” According to an anonymous British official recently quoted in the Independent, Barr’s inquiries have been “like nothing we have come across before, they are basically asking, in quite robust terms, for help in doing a hatchet job on their own intelligence services.”

“That’s all bullshit,” Barr said to me in his office of the skepticism surrounding his overseas meetings, which he said were necessary under the circumstances. “This is a case where we’re asking for assistance and information, some of which is sensitive or classified information.”

It would be easy to dismiss Durham’s probe as a fool’s errand simply because some unserious people are taking it seriously, but there are legitimate questions to be asked about how the FBI conducted itself, like: Why didn’t the Bureau try to warn Trump’s campaign it was afraid the Russians were trying to compromise the candidate before it launched a counterintelligence operation? (Naming it Crossfire Hurricane does convey a gunslinging mentality.) Barr has defended his use of the term spying to describe the FBI’s actions, calling it a “perfectly good English word,” and has said the use of surveillance against a campaign is “a serious red line that’s been crossed.” Defenders of the FBI’s handling of the investigation say that any irregularities were the result of panic, not politics, and that the prospect of foreign infiltration of a presidential campaign presented an extraordinary threat calling for extraordinary vigilance. Fragmentary reports about the findings of a just-completed report by the Justice Department’s inspector general, examining some of the same issues and scheduled to be released December 9, say it concludes that the FBI’s decision to launch the counterintelligence investigation was justified based on the evidence it had. But Barr is said to disagree with the report’s conclusions, feeling that Durham has found information that deserves further investigation and contending that agencies outside the purview of the DOJ’s internal watchdog, such as the CIA, may have important undisclosed information.

In their Italian trips, Barr and Durham reportedly showed interest in evidence pertaining to Joseph Mifsud, a mysterious Russia-connected professor who tipped off a Trump adviser about the hacking and release of Democratic emails in early 2016. Mifsud is also a fixture of right-wing conspiracy theories, which postulate that he was an agent not of Russia but the CIA and somehow working against Trump. On December 4, the Washington Post reported that the inspector general’s report uncovered no evidence to support the theory that Mifsud was a CIA asset and questioned whether Durham had, either.

Barr’s critics contend he merely wants to keep asking questions until he finds the answer Trump wants or at least confuses the issue politically. In the darkest light, Durham’s investigation looks like a way for Trump to undermine the impeachment inquiry — which, after all, emanated from the CIA — while also holding the threat of punishment over those he has already purged, like Strzok, Comey, and Comey’s deputy Andrew McCabe. “It’s worse than even I anticipated,” says Neil Kinkopf, a liberal legal scholar who warned of the “breathtaking scope” of Barr’s theory of presidential power at his Senate-confirmation hearing. “I think I was at the extreme end of bad, but even I did not anticipate him acting as the president’s political lawyer.”

“What’s political for one side is law enforcement for the other,” says one of Barr’s aides. “It depends on where you sit. But you follow the law to where it goes.” In some cases, the law goes to uncomfortable places for Trump. Early this year, for instance, Barr was briefed on an investigation being conducted by the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which was looking into a pair of Giuliani associates who were then in the midst of helping him pressure a prosecutor in Ukraine to announce an investigation of a gas company with which Hunter Biden was involved. In October, the two men were hurriedly arrested at Dulles airport, shortly after meeting Giuliani at Trump’s hotel in Washington. They were charged with lying about their political donations, which included a $325,000 contribution to a Trump-aligned super-PAC. Subpoenas in that case have lately reached into Trump’s fund-raising and many other potentially embarrassing areas.

Although the Southern District is unofficially known as the Sovereign District, because it operates with stubborn autonomy, it is still an office of the Justice Department, reporting to the attorney general. So far, the investigation has proceeded without publicly reported interference, even as prosecutors have reportedly focused on Giuliani himself. Barr is said to have little affection for Trump’s increasingly erratic private attorney. But even so, he has argued, in his 2018 memo, that the president has “absolute” discretion to place “his thumb on the scale in favor of lenity” — meaning Trump could, in theory, ask him to take it easy on his friend Rudy. When I asked Barr if there were any limits, outside of illegality, on what the president could instruct him to do, he told me he and Trump had set strict ground rules. “Right from the very beginning,” Barr said, “the president made clear to me, and we discussed, that he will not get into the business of talking about, or asking me, either to pursue, or not to pursue, cases. He leaves that up to my judgment.”

Still, if there is one thing that is now clear about Barr, it is that he carries out orders. Both his friends and his critics accept that he is motivated less by a desire to protect this individual president than to reinforce the institution of the presidency, especially and not coincidentally in periods when the executive branch is controlled by the Republican Party. “He’s come to this theory that the presidency should be all-powerful,” says Donald Ayer, a Justice Department official in the first Bush administration who belongs to Checks and Balances. “And here you have a president who is going to afford you, by his blunderbuss behavior, a lot of context in which you can push or test your theory.”

A few days before I met Barr, Trump had given a rambling interview to Fox & Friends. He had talked up the Justice Department’s ongoing counter-investigation led by Durham like a wrestler promoting a showdown, predicting that “Bull Durham” would soon reveal a plot to “overthrow the presidency” and thereby help to prove the corruption of the entire impeachment “scam.” I asked Barr how that fit into their ground rules.

Barr blinked quizzically. He seemed to be genuinely unaware of the Fox interview, which had burned up social media. His staffers hurriedly tried to brief him.

“There’s a movie, Bull Durham — ” his chief of staff began.

“Yeah, yeah,” Barr said. He knew that part.

“I’ll just say it again,” Barr told me, reverting to a practiced answer. “I don’t pay attention to the tweets. If he has something to say to me, he’ll say it to me directly.”

In a statement long on quotes from the Founding Fathers and short on details, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced on Thursday morning that she had asked the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

While she did not specifically address the question of the scope of these articles, her statement, like the impeachment proceedings so far, focused mostly on impeachment as the sole and proper remedy for a president selling out national interests in dealing with foreign governments. That would suggest a principal article of impeachment focused on the “favor” Trump asked Ukraine’s president to do for him and its intended effect of helping Trump get reelected by lowering a Ukrainian boom on Joe Biden. But since the Mueller report’s elaborate presentation of evidence of presidential obstruction of justice also involved an investigation into foreign meddling in the 2016 election, an article or articles dealing with those offenses would be within the scope of an impeachment drive focused on Trump’s relationship with foreign governments. And Pelosi did briefly mention the president’s efforts to subvert Congress’ role as a co-equal branch of government, so an article on obstruction of Congress via defiance of subpoenas would be in order, too.

The important thing to remember is that these three subjects for articles of impeachment — the Ukraine scandal, obstruction of congressional efforts to investigate the Ukraine scandal, and obstruction of the Russia investigation — have already been thoroughly aired publicly, which means the Judiciary Committee can move quickly on them. And the Washington Post is reporting that in a House Democratic Caucus meeting on Wednesday, Pelosi sounded committed to her original Christmas deadline for finishing up impeachment:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff left little doubt with fellow Democrats Wednesday that they plan to move swiftly to impeach President Trump as soon as this month …

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff left little doubt with fellow Democrats Wednesday that they plan to move swiftly to impeach President Trump as soon as this month.

The caucus, according to multiple members, erupted with shouts of approval.

At the Judiciary Committee’s impeachment hearing on Tuesday, Republicans (and the witness they called) agitated the air incessantly about the speed with which House Democrats are moving towards impeachment. As is his habit, the president undercut his defenders pretty decisively in a pair of early-morning tweets:

The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2019

.....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2019

So the race is on. Current plans are that other committee chairmen — notably Adam Schiff — will present their committees’ findings on impeachable offenses to the Judiciary Committee next week, and formal articles will be unveiled the week of December 16 at the latest and approved quickly by the Judiciary Committee, where there’s no reason to expect anything other than a strict party-line vote. At that point there will be just nine shopping days left before Christmas, and even less time for the House to debate and vote on impeachment of the president. Everyone can only hope there’s not a government shutdown right in the middle of the impeachment drama."

Two new developments attest to this point: a remarkable pair of revelatory tweets from Giuliani, and a tour de force of reporting in The Post, which reveals that Trump routinely communicated throughout the whole saga with Giuliani on unsecured devices, which may have been vulnerable to monitoring by Russia.

Giuliani’s tweets are revealing, and not in a good way

“The conversation about corruption in Ukraine was based on compelling evidence of criminal conduct by then VP Biden,” Giuliani tweeted, referring to Joe Biden, the intended target of “investigations” Trump and Giuliani pressured Ukraine to announce.

To empirically grounded observers, this will blow up a key Trump defense: that in conditioning official acts on getting Ukraine to announce the investigations he wanted, he was correctly concerned with cleaning up corruption there.

AD

AD

After all, Giuliani just confirmed that in pressuring Ukraine, “investigate corruption” actually meant, “smear Trump’s political rival.” We already knew this — Giuliani and Trump have said it publicly for months — but that’s an unusually stark way to admit it.

Yet Giuliani doesn’t view this as an admission at all. Why not? Because he also stated that Biden was, in fact, guilty of unstated “criminal conduct,” that Biden and other Democrats had conspired with Ukrainian corruption, and that Giuliani would produce proof.

The Biden corruption narrative Giuliani has worked to validate has been thoroughly debunked. But Giuliani can make it true by saying it, and by producing fake “evidence” backing it up.

AD

This amounts to more than conventional political lying. You see this in Giuliani’s crucial next step: the creation of a disinformational narrative hermetically sealed off from outside facts can magically transform even a demand for investigations into Biden from a corrupt demand that a foreign power help rig our election by smearing a political opponent into a virtuous demand for investigations into “corruption.”

This scandal is all about disinformation

Making this narrative “true,” via the triumph of disinformation, is at the core of this entire scandal. It is why the White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid were conditioned on getting Ukraine to release statements validating that narrative with disinformation, along with another fictional narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in 2016, in collusion with Democrats.

AD

You cannot watch House Republicans, or Sean Hannity, rant about this bundle of theories without concluding we’re witnessing something very different from routine political lying here.

AD

Our own intelligence services have confirmed that the 2016-Ukraine lie has been a mainstay of Russian disinformation for years. This is the through line back to 2016: The Russian attack on our political system was in large part disinformation warfare, to sow social discord and undermine liberal democracy.

AD

Even the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has elaborated on this disinformation warfare in great detail. Perversely, the current disinformation effort is about making that 2016 disinformation warfare disappear. Trump and Russia have a common interest in doing that, because Trump benefited from and participated in that effort.

Trump’s unsecured connection

The Post documents in extraordinary detail that unsecured communications between Trump and Giuliani were vulnerable to Russian eavesdropping throughout their efforts to extort Ukraine. As experts note, this likely means Russia knew of them in real time — possibly before the whistleblower first exposed them.

AD

AD

All this meant Moscow could “exploit” this knowledge:

Insight into Giuliani’s discussions with Trump could enable Moscow to adapt or amplify its propaganda promoting the baseless claim that Ukraine, rather than Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee in the 2016 U.S. election. That claim is now widely embraced by Trump’s Republican allies. Russia is already using its disinformation capabilities to target U.S. citizens, officials said, and could enlist its own operatives in Ukraine to feed false information to Giuliani.

In other words, Trump’s unsecured conversations left us further vulnerable to Russian disinformation.

None of this is to endorse in any way the “Trump is a Russian asset” narrative, and no one should assume Trump has deliberately left us vulnerable to Russian disinformation. Indeed, it’s often hard to say where Trump’s own disinformation ends and where Russia’s begins.

But what we can say is that the disinformation employed by Giuliani, Trump and his GOP defenders in many ways overlaps with Russian disinformation. They share tropes and narratives, and some common goals.

And it’s evident that Trump may not care if we’re more vulnerable to Russian disinformation, since he benefited from it so extensively last time, and is now heavily trafficking in its offshoots himself. As Giuliani’s latest confession shows, their commitment to employing and benefiting from it is only escalating.

Trump is not identified by name in the House phone records, but investigators said they suspect he may be a person with a blocked number listed as “-1” in the files. And administration officials said separately that Trump has communicated regularly with Giuliani on unsecured lines.

“It happened all the time,” said one former senior aide, who noted that Giuliani had a range of foreign clients.

The disclosures provide fresh evidence suggesting that the president continues to defy the security guidance urged by his aides and followed by previous incumbents — a stance that is particularly remarkable given Trump’s attacks on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign for her use of a private email account while serving as secretary of state.

The connection to the Ukraine campaign is also troubling because of how Moscow could exploit knowledge that Trump was secretly engaged in efforts to extract political favors from the government in Kyiv.

Insight into Giuliani’s discussions with Trump could enable Moscow to adapt or amplify its propaganda promoting the baseless claim that Ukraine, rather than Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee in the 2016 U.S. election. That claim is now widely embraced by Trump’s Republican allies. Russia is already using its disinformation capabilities to target U.S. citizens, officials said, and could enlist its own operatives in Ukraine to feed false information to Giuliani, who traveled to Kyiv this week. He met there with a Ukrainian lawmaker who studied at the KGB’s academy in Moscow in the early 1990s.

The White House declined to comment, and Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment.

AD

Trump and Giuliani have effectively “given the Russians ammunition they can use in an overt fashion, a covert fashion or in the twisting of information,” said John Sipher, former deputy chief of Russia operations at the CIA. Sipher and others said that it is so likely that Russia tracked the calls of Giuliani and others that the Kremlin probably knows more now about those conversations than impeachment investigators.

AD

“Congress and investigators have call records that suggest certain things but have no means whatsoever of getting the actual text” of what was said, Sipher said. “I guarantee the Russians have the actual information.”

U.S. officials said that Giuliani would have been considered a target of Russian intelligence efforts from early in Trump’s presidency and that it is assumed that the Kremlin intensified its surveillance of the president’s lawyer when he turned his focus to Ukraine — a former Soviet republic and target of Kremlin aggression where Russian intelligence has made deep inroads — late last year.

AD

“That would definitely put him on the radar,” said a U.S. official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “There’s no way around that.”

Other officials went further, saying that Trump’s conduct has become a matter of renewed concern among senior officials at the White House after repeated attempts to break him of his habit of speaking on his own cellphone or to others using unsecured lines.

AD

“It’s absolutely a security issue,’’ the former aide said, noting that foreign intelligence agencies could be listening in on the president’s unsecured calls with Giuliani. “It’s a bonanza for them.”

Former officials said Trump has provided his private cell number to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but it’s unclear whether he has had conversations with those leaders on his cellphone. Four people in communication with him in recent months said that he continues to use that device routinely.

AD

John F. Kelly, then White House chief of staff, and intelligence officials made a concerted attempt in 2017 to get Trump to use secure White House lines, even after the president had retreated to the residence in the evenings, officials said. But when Trump realized that this enabled Kelly to compile daily logs of his calls, and the identities of those he was speaking to, Trump became annoyed and reverted to using his cellphone, officials said. “He was totally paranoid that everyone knew who he was talking to,” a former senior administration official said.

AD

Aides were so determined to push the president to use hardened landlines that they gave him a tutorial on how foreign governments could listen to his calls, former administration officials said. Aides said that Trump’s habits improved but that he still frequently used a cellphone they viewed as less safe.

The president now uses a government cellphone that is hardened and routinely scrubbed, administration officials say, but it is still viewed as less safe than using the hardened lines.

AD

The House report identifies dozens of calls at key moments in the campaign to pressure Ukraine that may have been vulnerable to Russian monitoring.

On the day that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was told by the State Department to return to Washington, Giuliani had 11 calls with phone numbers associated with the White House, according to the report, as well as a nearly nine-minute phone call with “-1.”

AD

In the middle of that flurry of communications, Giuliani had an eight-minute phone call with Lev Parnas, his Soviet-born associate, raising the possibility that the former New York mayor may have been recounting his interactions with the White House that day. Foreign intelligence agencies often glean information about a primary target, such as a senior official in the White House, through monitoring the ancillary communications of others in touch with them, according to former intelligence operatives.

AD

The web of calls underscores the extent to which Trump entrusted aspects of his secret agenda with Ukraine to a network of people outside the U.S. government.

Senior administration officials, including former top White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill, testified that they were largely kept in the dark about Giuliani’s activities and communications with Trump.

AD

U.S. officials said that Russia has benefited from nearly every aspect of the Ukraine controversy, including the strain it has placed on Ukraine’s relationship with the United States, the attempt to divert attention from Russia’s attacks on a U.S. election, and the paralyzing impact the impeachment inquiry has had on Washington.

AD

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced on Wednesday that the House would proceed with articles of impeachment against Trump, who is accused of abusing the powers of his office for political gain. At the center of the case is a July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, and probe a conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine rather than Russia for hacking the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election.

As alleged leverage, Trump withheld a White House meeting sought by Zelensky until the Ukrainian leader made a public commitment to those investigations, which stood to help Trump in the 2020 election, and ordered a suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

AD

The records released in the House impeachment report show potential security vulnerabilities that extend beyond the White House. The report also lists calls between Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and Parnas, who officials said is also considered a likely target of Russian intelligence, given that he was going back and forth to Ukraine and speaking to high-level tycoons and government officials there.

In an appearance on Fox News this week, Nunes said that he did not recall speaking with Parnas but that it was possible. A spokesman for Nunes did not respond to requests for comment on his communications with Parnas and Giuliani.

U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland also spoke in July with Trump by cellphone from an outdoor table at a restaurant in central Kyiv, a city where U.S. officials said Russia had intercepted a phone call in 2014 between two senior U.S. diplomats and leaked it to drive a wedge between the United States and Europe.

House investigators’ ability to obtain Giuliani’s call records by subpoenaing logs from mobile phone companies suggests that those calls were not made using secure lines or encrypted applications such as Signal or WhatsApp — which likely would have rendered those calls invisible to the mobile providers.

The metadata logs provide details on the time, duration and participants on the calls but not their contents. Citing that gap, Giuliani suggested this week that he may not have been speaking to Trump about Ukraine during the conversations.

“The mere fact I had numerous calls with the White House does not establish any specific topic,” Giuliani said in a tweet on Wednesday. “Remember, I’m the president’s attorney.”

But Giuliani has previously said he was updating the president regularly on his Ukraine activities, and Trump told those working on Ukraine policy to go through Giuliani.

Even the use of a secure White House line provides no meaningful security if the recipient of the call is on an unsecured line or cellphone, officials said.

“Giuliani calling the president through the Situation Room does not guarantee any level of security because he’s using a commercial cellphone and at least part of his call is coming over commercial phone lines,” said Larry Pfeiffer, former senior director of the White House Situation Room in the Obama administration and former chief of staff to the CIA director. And even if both parties were using commercially encrypted apps such as WhatsApp or Signal, Pfeiffer said, “I would not want to be trusting commercial encryption over government encryption when conducting national security business.”

Giuliani has used the ­WhatsApp encrypted text application but is otherwise known for his lack of technological sophistication."

“The world is broken,” said Kerry, who was made available for the interview by Biden’s campaign. “Our politics are broken. The country faces extraordinary challenges. And I believe very deeply that Joe Biden’s character, his ability to persevere, his decency and the experiences that he brings to the table are critical to the moment. The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.”

Kerry cited Trump’s trip to the NATO summit in Britain this week. “The petulance and smallness and ridicule that he invited is very dangerous for all of us,” Kerry said. “And that just underscores the urgency of people recognizing the assets that Joe Biden brings to the table.”

He also said he felt strongly that Biden could beat Trump next November. “The president knows it,” he added. “And that’s why he was so busy dispatching Rudy Giuliani and engaging in unconstitutional behavior.”

The endorsement by the former secretary of state dovetailed with another effort by Biden to highlight disdain for Trump on the world stage, including at the just-concluded NATO meetings, where some foreign leaders were filmed mocking him.

In a lancing ad posted Wednesday night on Twitter, Biden used that video and other Trump foreign policy conflicts, juxtaposed against pictures of Biden dealing soberly with world leaders and stepping off Air Force Two as vice president.

In his narration, Biden called Trump “insincere, ill-informed, corrupt, dangerously incompetent and incapable, in my view, of world leadership.” By late Thursday, the video had been viewed almost 9 million times.

AD

Kerry’s endorsement comes at a moment when Biden has drawn criticism for a lack of consistency as a candidate. He is struggling in both Iowa and New Hampshire, where he began the campaign leading the field and has slipped significantly, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. The Iowa bus tour is part of the Biden campaign’s effort to turn around his candidacy.

AD

The announcement marks the second notable endorsement for Biden by a member of former president Barack Obama’s Cabinet. Tom Vilsack, the former agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor, and his wife, Christie, endorsed Biden late last month and have campaigned with him in Iowa.

Sixteen years ago, in late 2003, then-Sen. Kerry was in a similar situation to that of Biden today, with his presidential campaign lagging in Iowa — and struggling nationally far more than Biden’s. Kerry revived his candidacy early in 2004, winning Iowa and then New Hampshire and from there cruising to the nomination. Asked what Biden should do to get his campaign moving, Kerry said, “He needs to do exactly what he’s doing now.”

AD

He also defended Biden against criticism, saying the media has sometimes created characterizations that overstate the candidate’s problems. He pointed to Biden’s resiliency in national polling and to the breadth of Biden’s coalition and in particular his support from African Americans.

AD

Kerry conceded that Biden has sometimes appeared to struggle to find words in the candidates’ debates but dismissed it as insignificant. “Who hasn’t done that, over a lifetime?” he said. “He is just honest, straightforward. He’s a Joe that represents the middle class of America and understands them, I think, in ways that will reach way beyond Donald Trump in a general election.”

Kerry said his decision to back Biden is not meant as criticism of any of the other Democrats in the race, including two from his home state of Massachusetts — Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former governor Deval Patrick. “I like Elizabeth enormously. I worked very hard to help her win her seat. And I like Deval. I worked closely with him as governor. I just think Joe is the person for the moment,” he said.

AD

Kerry was secretary of state in 2014 when Biden’s son Hunter joined the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. At the time, Biden was the point person leading an effort, backed by U.S. allies, to fire the Ukrainian prosecutor, who was regarded as an obstacle to attacking corruption in the country. While there has been no proof of wrongdoing by the Bidens, Trump and his loyalists have seized on their actions; the president’s demand that Ukraine’s new leader investigate the Bidens has formed the nucleus of the ongoing House impeachment inquiry.

AD

Republicans have raised the prospect of calling both Bidens to appear at Senate hearings, but Kerry said he wasn’t worried about that possibility. “I’m not concerned about that, and I think there won’t be very much,” he said. “You guys will discern pretty quickly how craven and empty it is. Obviously, this could be a tough fight. But I think Joe is up to being tough.”

When Kerry was struggling in late 2003, he watched as Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont and the presidential front-runner, picked up high-profile endorsements, including from former vice president Al Gore and then-Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. Those endorsements proved of little value in the end for Dean.

“I think the value of it [the endorsement] is that it stops people, hopefully, and provides some food for thought. I have never presumed anybody can tell anybody else how to vote,” he said. “I don’t approach it that way. It’s a recommendation and a rationale. . . . People will make their own judgments.”

A central conceit of the last two Republican presidential campaigns was that President Obama had eviscerated America’s global standing. Mitt Romney cast him as inordinately apologetic. “President Obama began his [presidency] with an apology tour,” Romney claimed. “America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators.” Trump similarly claimed that Obama got duped into unfavorable deals with countries like Iran and went so far as to call him “the founder of ISIS” for his purported diplomacy failures in the Middle East. This was part of a pattern: The ex-president, Trump has claimed over the years, was a “disaster,” “weak,” “ineffective,” and “the worst president maybe in the history of our country.” “We need a President who isn’t a laughing stock to the entire World,” he tweeted in 2014.

The claim made by both men — and echoed by a range of conservative pundits — is that Obama projected weakness and therefore failed to command respect. America’s enemies and allies alike ran roughshod over him as a consequence, greatly eroding the country’s esteem on matters both military and economic while his countrymen wallowed in shame back home. This is demonstrably false: If anything, Obama improved how other nations viewed the United States, overseeing a dramatic spike in worldwide favorability that had plummeted during George W. Bush’s tenure and has fallen again under Trump. (The Obama spike was most acute in Western Europe; in Middle Eastern countries racked by his drone war and decimated by Bush-initiated military occupations, U.S. favorability has stayed underwater.)

The nagging irony is that Trump — the self-styled strongman elected to resurrect American greatness from the grave in which Obama purportedly buried it — has made a practice of getting laughed at by foreign leaders. This dynamic generated headlines during the NATO convening this week, where French president Emmanuel Macron used reverse psychology to provoke him into expressing plaudits for NATO — which the American president had previously lambasted and sought to withdraw from — then joined Prime Ministers Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom and Justin Trudeau of Canada to laugh at Trump’s knack for aimless rambling. Their mirth was preceded by that toward a speech Trump made at the United Nations in 2018, where he claimed, absurdly, that his “administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” The audience of foreign dignitaries responded by collectively bursting into laughter. Most recently, the lack of respect Trump commands on the global stage was the theme of a Joe Biden attack ad.

Unsurprising though it may be that Trump has pursued his promise to restore American esteem abroad by making a mockery of it, it’s equally unsurprising that his supporters in Congress and the electorate are mostly unbothered. (Romney, to his credit, is a rare exception.) This can be explained largely by partisanship: Trump has pursued a racist and plutocratic domestic-policy agenda that aligns firmly with much of the GOP’s own, so it’s often in their interest to continue supporting him no matter how embarrassing he is. But it’s also explicable by the manner in which he and his followers believe their power should be projected — namely, performed loudly and insistently with little regard to how its putative targets actually interpret it. What Trump thinks translates as power, after all, is apparently not the same as what Macron and Trudeau do. On the contrary, plenty who encounter this behavior find it amusing, even worthy of ridicule.

But this fails to register — or matter — to Trump and his supporters because the rest of the world and its leaders are not their intended audience. It’s a display for their own benefit, an assertion of their ability to menace those with smaller guns, less money, and less to gain cathartically from responding in kind — a way to claim a superficial brand of social dominance recognized primarily by themselves. This is not an accurate reflection of real strength, brute or otherwise. Obama’s more conciliatory approach to foreign policy neither diminished his standing with NATO nor negated the number of nuclear weapons at his disposal. It’s a difference of affect, a divergence in philosophy regarding how the American ego should be stroked. Obama’s approach, at least initially, endeared him to those critical of Bush-era jingoism. Trump’s does the same for people who think saying “sorry” makes you weak.

This difference complicates any analysis claiming that ridicule from global leaders is a crushing blow to Trump’s ego. Fragile though that may be — and while he almost certainly despises being laughed at — the respect he craves most is that of his supporters who, ironically, applaud him for the same conduct that elicits eye rolls from those whose regard he purports to be regaining. It doesn’t require a brilliant political strategist to weigh the costs and benefits of such a dynamic and conclude that it’s more important — if one wishes to win reelection — to please the people voting for you than those in other countries with whom you conduct sporadic diplomacy.

It also highlights a political advantage: The American electoral system is set up so that Trump can win reelection while earning several million fewer votes than his opponent. His primary mandate is to attract a crucial cohort of (almost exclusively white) supporters in a handful of states while ensuring that his core supporters stay motivated. It’s an indictment of American pseudo-democracy that this reelection strategy has been proved successful once before, and rests on the whims of a minority that shares his appetites rather than a majority that largely does not. Crucially, none of this translates to worldwide respect. And rather than aberrant, such behavior merely continues a long history of American arrogance on the global stage — an impulse to manipulate international affairs, often by force, to suit its own ends with minimal regard to the upheaval, impoverishment, or death it causes others. Trump’s putative mission to reestablish the country’s global standing isn’t a failure if it’s not actually the goal. Instead, it’s poised to pay dividends by a metric dearer to Trump’s heart: getting reelected in 2020."

The endorsement is a boost for Buttigieg from a high profile African American official from Obama’s orbit at a time when the South Bend mayor is working to build support with black voters.” He also got endorsements from Austan Goolsbee, Obama’s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Linda Douglass, the former director of communications for his Office of Health Reform.

These endorsements follow former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick’s entrance into the race. He reportedly had the backing of another subset of Obama alumni, including Obama’s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and former Obama strategist David Axelrod. Here, too, one sees a bit of a generational divide. (Axelrod and Jarrett are in their 60s; Love is under 40, and Goolsbee is 50.)

AD

Ironically, the Buttigieg endorsements come on the same day a peer of former vice president Joe Biden’s, former senator and secretary of state John Kerry, endorsed Biden. (Kerry is two years younger than Biden.) Kerry sure doesn’t think Biden is too old; he has just been around a while, one could say.

Buttigieg, a political moderate, faces an older, establishment figure in Biden, just as Obama ran against Hillary Clinton in 2008. There is a parallelism in that Obama, the first African American major-party nominee, was certainly riskier than Clinton and lacked her years of experience. To her supporters, it at times must have been galling to see this confident young man take on a candidate as well qualified as Clinton. There’s a little bit of that “Who’s this kid?” resentment in this year’s race as well.

Those of us who think presidents must have substantial public experience and think longevity in office is a good thing seem to have lost the argument somewhere between Obama and President Trump. Whether you think that is a disagreeable development, it is hard to deny that experience has been downgraded as a qualification for millions of voters. They want the man or woman who reaches them on a gut level and, most important, can clobber Trump. Should Buttigieg’s head-to-head numbers against Trump start going up (as they surely would if he wins an early primary), he might level the playing field with Biden, who has the biggest lead against Trump in these polls.

AD

AD

We therefore have the quintessential match-up between youth/vision and age/experience, highlighted by Biden’s well-received ad. “We need a leader the world respects,” is the tag line with images of Biden alongside world leaders, speaking overseas and representing the United States at international events. The ad is not just a dig at Trump, but also an argument about stature and experience. Biden in many ways is the antithesis of Buttigieg, although their policies are virtually indistinguishable. (His performances in one-on-one interviews are significantly stronger than in debates, by the way.)

Democrats want the most electable candidate, but in truth no one really knows whether someone of Trump’s generation (but with integrity, working-class credentials and knowledge of government) or someone nearly half his age (and with brains, military service and verbal quickness) would have the edge. In the end, I suspect, voters will go with the candidate they feel most comfortable with and conclude other people will feel the same way. And in this case, either one would have infinitely more knowledge of the world and more character than the incumbent.

He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump,” the report continued. “His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.”

Biden has survived and is now more critical of his rivals, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) who he claims never got the scrutiny she deserved for her Medicare-for-all plan. (He might have added that she has not gotten many queries about her subsequent retreat from Medicare-for-all, either.) He has a few things going for him now that the candidates have dwindled.

AD

AD

First, no one in Iowa can honestly doubt who he is and what he stands for. He was never for Medicare-for-all; he wants to build on the Affordable Care Act. He is not an America First or an America Retreat proponent. Reporters talk a lot about authenticity but do not seem to grasp that, for many voters, all those gaffes and strange verbal journeys show how different he is from his opponents. He does not need to introduce himself to the African American community. He is comfortable in his own skin (maybe too comfortable?), which voters can sense. Even if they don’t love him, they trust him.

Second, Biden sure has lowered expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire. That is the flip side of losing one’s lead. He does not have to win or even come in second to keep going. Staying ahead of one or more of his rivals in these first two races likely will be good enough to keep him in the race through Super Tuesday when his national name recognition and support among nonwhite voters will pay off.

Finally, as Trump destroys one government institution after another, sending career civil servants into retirement and deforming the mission of Cabinet departments (Does anyone think the Environmental Protection Agency is looking out for your health and well-being?), it might dawn on voters that the next president will find the federal government in utter disarray. It surely is the case that the next president will have to rebuild our reputation internationally.

The world is laughing at President Trump. They see him for what he really is: dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.

Under such circumstances, perhaps someone who knows everyone and every nook and cranny of government and every world leader would be useful.

This is not to say that Biden is the “front-runner,” but he has as good a chance as anyone to win the nomination. He and his team have figured out that Twitter and the rest of social media, not to mention national media outlets’ snarky 30-something reporters, don’t represent America. You would be foolish to count him out.

THE BIG IDEA: Joe Biden won’t apologize for the deportations.

Barack Obama’s administration deported more than 3 million undocumented immigrants during his two terms, including 1.18 million in his first three years. In that equivalent amount of time, President Trump has deported fewer than 800,000.

In an interview that aired Thursday night on Telemundo, the Spanish-language station owned by NBC, anchor José Díaz-Balart tried repeatedly to get the former vice president to say he was sorry – to no avail.

Sitting on his “No Malarkey” bus, which he’s been using to barnstorm Iowa this week, Biden said he has “nothing” to apologize for. “Nothing,” he said with emphasis, adding that he and Obama did the best they could to help “the undocumenteds,” as the 77-year-old referred to them at one point during the back-and-forth.

“No, I think what we should be doing is acknowledging that comparing what President Obama did and what Trump did is night and day,” Biden said.

“No, but the numbers are there,” said Díaz-Balart.

“No, no, no, no,” said Biden.

“More than 3 million people were deported,” said the anchor.

“I understand that,” Biden said, blaming Republicans. “That was what the law was at the time.”

Biden said Obama deserves credit for minimizing deportations in the second term once it became clear Congress wouldn’t act. The Supreme Court is now considering the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. “If the Supreme Court rules against it, we're going to get it passed,” Biden said, referring to the fate of the “dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children.

-- Unlike most of his opponents in the Democratic field, Biden still hasn’t released a comprehensive immigration plan. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker have unveiled proposals. So did Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and California Sen. Kamala Harris before they dropped out. Among the other contenders in the top tier, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also hasn’t released a detailed plan on immigration.

-- The Biden campaign is working to finalize a plan. In an interview with the Daily 202, Cristóbal Alex, former president of the Latino Victory Fund and the Biden campaign’s most senior adviser for issues involving Hispanic voters, previewed the plan he said will be “forthcoming.” It will outline an end to Trump’s family separation policy, protections for “dreamers” and address the root causes of the immigration crisis. This will include a proposal for foreign aid to stabilize the Northern Triangle countries in Central America, similar to what Sanders and Warren had in their plans.

Alex said Biden has repeatedly emphasized to him personally that he’s committed to spending considerable political capital to achieve a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration laws if he’s elected president. Alex said that will include legislation to provide citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country.

In the Telemundo interview last night, Biden said he supports allowing undocumented immigrants to benefit from his proposed expansion of the Affordable Care Act, specifically the public option. He quipped that as he builds out Obamacare, it will eventually become “Bidencare.”

“And they'd be able to buy in just like anyone else could,” Biden said of undocumented immigrants.

-- Biden’s plan will be more moderate than his rivals. So far, the biggest flashpoint in the Democratic immigration debate this year has been over whether to repeal a portion of the law that makes it a criminal offense to illegally enter the United States. The proposal was first made by former housing secretary Julián Castro, the first candidate to publish a detailed immigration plan, and it targets Section 1325 of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, which the Trump administration used to defend its family separation policies. Sanders and Warren endorsed Castro’s idea.

Biden still opposes repealing Section 1325, and that won’t change. He said during one of the debates that changing the law could incentivize more illegal immigration. “Repealing that section could undermine our immigration system. It could undermine efforts to combat human smuggling,"" Alex said in an interview. “It would shift an additional burden into the immigration court system. Additionally, if the logic behind ending 1325 is to end family separation, there are likely at least eight other laws on the books that someone nefarious and anti-immigrant like Trump could use to separate families. So the problem isn't 1325. The problem is Donald Trump.”

-- Biden’s lack of contrition for the Obama administration’s deportation record threatens to become a bigger hurdle as the field winnows and the contrasts sharpen. Overshadowed by the impeachment inquiry, plus the ideological clashes over Medicare-for-all, the immigration issue has drifted to the backburner of the Democratic conversation since the spring and summer.But Latinos are poised to play a potentially pivotal role in the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22, the third early state, and then when Super Tuesday arrives on March 3, when California, Texas and Colorado go to the polls.

“I think the big question for Biden is whether he will learn from what the Obama administration failed at when it came to immigration,” said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, in an interview. “He must recognize that we are in a different place and what the Trump administration has exposed is what happens when immigration agencies, whether it be Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Border Patrol, are allowed to continue to grow and to do so without any accountability or liability. What we’re experiencing right now is part of the mechanism and machinery that the Obama administration put into place.”

Biden disputes this criticism. “They would have been able to do that before that structure,” he said on Telemundo. “They could have done that if we didn't do anything.”

-- The sit-down with Telemundo is part of a strategy to convey to Latinos that he’s not taking them for granted after his national coalitions director Vanessa Cárdenas, his most senior Latina staffer, quit last month. She told at least two allies that she was frustrated her advice on immigration wasn’t being heeded, according to Politico. “The campaign is just hyper-focused on whites in Iowa and African-Americans and it placed less value on Latino outreach,” an unnamed immigration activist and friend who spoke with her told Marc Caputo. “Vanessa kept banging her head against the wall trying to get them to take the community more seriously. And Biden just really won’t change when it comes to the way he talks about immigration. It became too much.”

-- Biden acknowledged Cárdenas’s frustrations during a conference call with reporters last week when he was asked about her departure. The candidate complimented the “very, very good” work she did for him and insisted that Latino outreach is one of his priorities. He said he has no choice but to spend as much time as possible in Iowa and New Hampshire because he didn’t join the race until April. “I can understand her frustration, in terms of the number of days” spent in certain states, Biden said, according to the Associated Press. “I understand her frustration. I’m getting the same thing, and I’m sure every candidate is, no matter what state you’re in, why you’re not spending more time in other states. I wish her well. I’m sorry she was frustrated.”

Cárdenas did not respond to a request for comment.

-- Just days after she stepped down, on Nov. 22, Biden clashed with immigration activist Carlos Rojas when he asked the former vice president if he would pledge to halt deportations. Biden said no, explaining that he will prioritize deportations only for “people who have committed a felony of serious crime.” When Rojas, who noted that he was a volunteer for the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign, countered by saying that he became disenchanted with the Obama administration after it deported so many people, Biden suggested that maybe Rojas “should vote for Trump.”

-- There have been other, smaller missteps. In October, the Biden campaign unveiled “a national network of Latino supporters” called “Todos Con Biden.” But they didn’t reserve the URL for the web site or the Twitter handle. The Trump campaign snapped up both and used them to troll Biden with unflattering content. “Oops, Joe forgot about Latinos,” the landing page on todosconbiden.com says in English and Spanish, with a link to Trump’s Latino outreach page.

-- Notably, none of the Democratic presidential candidates are calling to abolish ICE. For a while last year, that looked like it might become a new litmus test from the left. Warren said she believes the agency needs to be “reorganized significantly.” Sanders spokeswoman Belén Sisa said the Vermont senator believes in breaking up ICE to curtail an agency that he believes has been “completely unaccountable to some of the monstrosities” that have occurred in the last three years.

Castro supports maintaining some of the ICE and DHS operations he considers critical to U.S. safety. His spokesman Sawyer Hackett pointed out that there are investigators within these agencies that conduct a lot of work around sex and drug trafficking. “We can maintain those components while also moving the [Enforcement and Removal] section of ICE to the Department of Justice where we have more oversight and more accountability of those agencies,” Hackett explained.

-- For now, Biden is polling well among Latinos, something he touted during last night’s interview. A Telemundo poll published last month showed Biden holding on to the support of 26 percent of Latino voters who identify as Democrats, with Sanders in second place at 18 percent. Warren trailed with 10 percent and Castro, the only Latino candidate in the race, polled at 2 percent.But even his boosters acknowledge that the race remains as fluid among this constituency as the electorate at large.Just like with African Americans, there is something of a generational divide between older Latinos and younger members of the community who tend to be more liberal and want bolder proposals.

MORE ON BIDEN:

-- The former vice president got into a testy back-and-forth yesterday afternoon with an Iowa farmer who called him too old to be president and challenged him on his son’s activities in Ukraine, prompting the former vice president to call the man “a damn liar” and challenge him to take an IQ test. “You’re damn near as old as I am,” the farmer said at a town hall meeting in New Hampton, Iowa. “You’re too old for the job. I’m 83, and I know damn well I don’t have the mental faculties I did 30 years ago. … We all know Trump has been messing around in the Ukraine over there, holding their foreign aid … saying they’re going to investigate you. But you, on the other hand, sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas or nothing, to get access to the president. You’re selling access to the president just like he was.”

“You’re a damn liar, man,” Biden replied. “That’s not true. And no one has ever said that.”

“The hell it ain’t,” the man replied. “I see it on the TV.”

Biden said he played no role in getting his son the job on the board of Burisma. Although Hunter Biden got that job when his father was vice president, with little to no relevant experience, there is no evidence that Joe Biden was “selling access to the president.”

“And by the way, I’m not sedentary,” Biden continued. “Look, the reason I’m running is I’ve been around a long time, and I know more than most people know. And I can get things done, that’s why I’m running. And you want to check my shape, man, let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test, okay?”

(Trump has also challenged people to take an IQ test, including former secretary of state Rex Tillerson in 2017.)

-- Rudy Giuliani met Thursday in Ukraine with one of the key figures working to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden, the Ukraine lawmaker said, after posting Facebook photographs of himself with Trump’s personal lawyer. “Andriy Derkach said he pressed Giuliani on the need to set up a joint U.S.-Ukraine investigation into corruption in Ukraine at the meeting in Kyiv,” David Stern and Robyn Dixon report. “Giuliani alleged ‘compelling’ evidence of criminal misdeeds by Biden [in a tweet after the meeting], but gave no specifics. … Derkach, an independent lawmaker who was formerly a member of a pro-Russian party in parliament, went to the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow. He is the son of a KGB officer who later served as head of Ukrainian intelligence.”

-- Former secretary of state John Kerry endorsed Biden and plans to campaign with him in Iowa on Friday and New Hampshire on Sunday. “I’m not endorsing Joe because I’ve known him a long time. I’m endorsing him because I know him so well,” Kerry told Dan Balz, who broke the story. “The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.”

Kerry, who served alongside Biden for decades in the Senate and won the Democratic nomination in 2004, said he feels strongly that his friend can beat Trump next November. “The president knows it,” he told Balz. “And that’s why he was so busy dispatching Rudy Giuliani and engaging in unconstitutional behavior.”

MORE ON THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- Video obtained by ProPublica shows how the Border Patrol held a sick teen in a concrete cell without proper medical attention and did not discover his body until his cellmate alerted guards about his death: “Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant, was seriously ill when immigration agents put him in a small South Texas holding cell with another sick boy on the afternoon of May 19. A few hours earlier, a nurse practitioner at the Border Patrol’s dangerously overcrowded processing center in McAllen had diagnosed him with the flu and measured his fever at 103 degrees. She said that he should be checked again in two hours and taken to the emergency room if his condition worsened. None of that happened. Worried that Carlos might infect other migrants in the teeming McAllen facility, officials moved him to a cell for quarantine at a Border Patrol station in nearby Weslaco. By the next morning, he was dead. … The agency said that an agent had found Carlos ‘unresponsive’ after checking in on him. Sanders said the Border Patrol was ‘committed to the health, safety and humane treatment of those in our custody.’ But the record shows that the Border Patrol fell far short of that standard with Carlos. ProPublica has obtained video that documents the 16-year-old’s last hours, and it shows that Border Patrol agents and health care workers at the Weslaco holding facility missed increasingly obvious signs that his condition was perilous.”

-- The number of pregnant immigration detainees has spiked 52 percent during the Trump administration. Maria Sacchetti reports: “The spike in pregnant detainees came after federal officials terminated an Obama administration order to release most expectant mothers because of health concerns. Advocates for immigrants had pushed the Obama administration to sharply curtail the practice of detaining pregnant women ahead of the 2016 elections, citing insufficient health care and nutrition in federal detention centers and contract jails and the increased risk of miscarriage. But shortly after the policy went into effect, Trump declared that nobody in the United States illegally is immune to detention and deportation.”

-- Under pressure, Trump's Department of Homeland Security backed away from its proposal to require mandatory facial scans for all U.S. citizens crossing the border. Lori Aratani reports: “Reports this week that Customs and Border Protection wanted to expand airport facial screening to U.S. citizens drew an immediate outcry from privacy advocates and lawmakers, who accused administration officials of reneging on promises that the scans would remain optional for citizens. … On Thursday, however, CBP said it was withdrawing the proposal. ‘There are no current plans to require U.S. citizens to provide photographs upon entry and exit from the United States,’ the agency said in a statement. ‘CBP intends to have the planned regulatory action regarding U.S. citizens removed from the unified agenda next time it is published.’”

-- The Trump administration’s plan to charge huge fees to obtain immigration records may have the unintended consequence of undermining the booming genealogy testing market. Sydney Trent reports: “The fees would nearly triple, and in many cases, they would rise nearly 500 percent, from $130 to $625 to obtain a single paper file. The little-known Genealogy Program administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allows genealogists, family historians and other researchers to obtain citizenship and alien registration files, visa applications and other records documenting the lives of deceased immigrants who arrived in the United States between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. … The increases come at a time when millions of Americans are discovering a passion for family genealogy, spurring the growth of websites and services that cater to them. Ancestry.com, one of the most popular, now has more than 3 million paying subscribers perusing its databases of documents and DNA connections.”

-- A new lawsuit challenges the Trump administration’s policy of requiring foreigners to list all of their social media accounts on visa applications. Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report: “The requirement — implemented as part of the president’s controversial crackdown on immigration — amounts to an illegal surveillance dragnet that threatens to chill political expression online, according to a group of documentary filmmakers, who filed their case with the backing of two advocacy groups, the Brennan Center for Justice and the Knight First Amendment Institute.”

-- A House committee chair called for an independent investigation into the $400 million border wall contract awarded this week to a North Dakota company owned by a frequent Fox News guest and major GOP donor. Trump personally pushed military officials to hire the firm. Nick Miroff reports: “In a letter to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said there are reasons to be suspicious of the decision to bestow such a large contract on the company. Thompson cited Trump’s repeated promotion of [Tommy] Fisher to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and a recent visit by the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to a span of privately financed barrier the firm built outside El Paso.”

Emergency responders head to the scene of a shooting on Friday morning near the Naval Air Base Station in Pensacola, Fla. (WEAR-TV via AP)

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- A shooter who opened fire Friday morning at Naval Air Station Pensacola, killing at least two people and injuring multiple people, has died, authorities said. Brittany Shammas and Alex Horton report: “It was unclear if the two victims killed were service members or civilians, said Lt. Cmdr. Megan Isaac, a Navy spokeswoman. … An active shooting at the Naval station was reported at about 6:45 a.m., and the base was placed on lockdown, the Navy said.”

-- The United States added 266,000 jobs in November as the jobless rate decreased to 3.5 percent, reflecting a surge of strength in the labor market that has muscled through recession fears that flared over the summer. Rachel Siegel reports: “The data, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, beat expectations. Analysts had forecast roughly 180,000 new jobs for the month. The 3.5 percent unemployment rate is back at a 50-year low. The jobs data offer the latest snapshot into an economy that appears to have lost some steam from 2018 but continues to grow.”

-- Elizabeth Warren released a letter from her physician this morning that describes her as “very healthy” and issued five pages of supporting medical records, making her the first of the four septuagenarians in the Democratic contest to provide details about their health. Annie Linskey reports: “Warren takes medication for hypothyroidism, a common condition in which the thyroid gland is underactive, according to the letter. Her blood pressure is 115/57, and she has had a flu shot this year. Warren is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 129 pounds. … Warren also provided a hematology report including information on everything from her platelet count to the size of her red blood cells. …

“Sanders, at 78, is the oldest candidate in the race. He suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, which sidelined him until a Democratic debate two weeks later. Sanders had two stents inserted, but his campaign has declined to specify how much damage his heart sustained and declined interview requests with his physician. The Vermont senator’s campaign has said it would provide his health records by the end of the year. … After a debate in September in which his answers sometimes meandered and one challenger appeared to allude to his age, Biden committed to releasing his health records ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Democrats are considering articles of impeachment against Trump that include obstruction and bribery, but they are unlikely to pursue a charge of treason. Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis report: “Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee, which this week released a report of their findings from a two-month-long impeachment investigation, have said that they believe Trump’s actions vis-a-vis Ukraine meet the definition of bribery, one of the crimes the Constitution identifies specifically as an impeachable offense. … Democratic leaders say they have overwhelming support in their ranks for articles dealing with the core of Trump’s conduct regarding Ukraine … Aides cautioned that the situation remains fluid and that discussions about the articles are ongoing. Several members of the Judiciary panel are also eager to make reference in the articles to the president’s alleged efforts to obstruct justice in former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia probe, arguing that Trump has repeatedly solicited or welcomed foreign interference in his election bids. …

""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) insisted that Russia was an integral factor in the president’s alleged misconduct regarding Ukraine, because when Trump decided to withhold military aid to Kyiv, it was the Kremlin that benefited. ‘Russia. It’s about Russia,’ Pelosi said. ‘All roads lead to Putin. Understand that.’ But Democrats have yet to commit to including articles of impeachment that directly address Trump’s alleged ties to Russia that were detailed in the Mueller report, or settle on how they will organize and draft their various grievances against the president.”

-- Pelosi shut down a reporter who asked her whether she ""hates"" Trump. Felicia Sonmez reports: “Pelosi … was about to exit the room when a reporter shouted out a question. ‘Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?’ James Rosen, a reporter for Sinclair Broadcast Group, called out from a seat in the front row. Most times, Pelosi ignores questions shouted at her in the hallways and briefing rooms of the Capitol. But Rosen’s query appeared to strike a nerve with Pelosi, who stopped in her tracks, turned to face the reporter and delivered an extraordinary rebuttal. ‘I don’t hate anybody,’ Pelosi said sternly, pointing her finger at Rosen, a reporter she has dismissed as ‘Mr. Republican Talking Points.’ Pelosi then referenced her Catholic upbringing and told Rosen, ‘Don’t accuse me.’ … ‘As a Catholic, I resent your using the word ‘hate’ in a sentence that addresses me,’ she said. ‘I don’t hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love, and [I] always pray for the president, and I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So, don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.’” Trump responded on Twitter that he does not believe Pelosi prays for him.

-- “These days Pelosi, a history major in college, spends much of her time quoting the founders of the nation in her bid to justify her move to embrace impeachment. Occasionally she favors the Bible,” Rachael Bade and DeBonis report in a ticktock on how the speaker transformed from a skeptic to the face of impeachment. “On Thursday morning, before lashing out at the news conference, she read verses from the Old Testament book of Jeremiah to her whip team in the Capitol basement — a warning about corrupt kings. ‘Attend to matters of justice. Set things right between people. Rescue victims from their exploiters. Don’t take advantage of the homeless, the orphans, the widows,’ she read. ‘Doom to the leader who builds palaces but bullies people, who makes a fine house but destroys lives.’”

-- The phone logs disclosed in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment report have raised fresh concerns about Trump’s use of unsecured communications, against the advice of aides and breaking with longstanding practice. Paul Sonne, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller report: “Trump has routinely communicated with [Giuliani] and other individuals speaking on cellphones vulnerable to monitoring by Russian and other foreign intelligence services, current and former U.S. officials said. Phone records released this week by the House Intelligence Committee revealed extensive communications between Giuliani, unidentified people at the White House and others involved in the campaign to pressure Ukraine, with no indication that those calls were encrypted or otherwise shielded from foreign surveillance. The revelations raise the possibility that Moscow was able to learn about aspects of Trump’s attempt to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival months before that effort was exposed by a whistleblower report and the impeachment inquiry, officials said. ... The disclosures provide fresh evidence suggesting that the president continues to defy the security guidance urged by his aides and followed by previous incumbents. ...

""Trump and Giuliani have effectively 'given the Russians ammunition they can use in an overt fashion, a covert fashion or in the twisting of information,' said John Sipher, former deputy chief of Russia operations at the CIA. Sipher and others said that it is so likely that Russia tracked the calls of Giuliani and others that the Kremlin probably knows more now about those conversations than impeachment investigators. 'Congress and investigators have call records that suggest certain things but have no means whatsoever of getting the actual text' of what was said, Sipher said. 'I guarantee the Russians have the actual information.'

""U.S. officials said that Giuliani would have been considered a target of Russian intelligence efforts from early in Trump’s presidency and that it is assumed that the Kremlin intensified its surveillance of the president’s lawyer when he turned his focus to Ukraine — a former Soviet republic and target of Kremlin aggression where Russian intelligence has made deep inroads — late last year. 'That would definitely put him on the radar,' said a U.S. official ... U.S. officials said that Russia would likely have him under physical surveillance when he is in Ukraine.""

-- The White House claims that no one from the Office of Management and Budget spoke with Giuliani. From the Journal: “The previously undisclosed phone number cited by the House Intelligence Committee in its impeachment inquiry report, which The Wall Street Journal has identified, isn’t directly linked to the Office of Management and Budget. It could instead reflect phone calls from other parts of the White House, according to people familiar with the matter … It isn’t known whom Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, spoke with in the administration in the calls reflected in the logs, but OMB officials say it wasn’t anyone on their staff. A White House official had previously said the call logs don’t align with the cellphone records of acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is also the budget office director. A senior House Intelligence Committee official said the panels overseeing the impeachment probe are continuing to investigate the call records, including whether the number described as linked to OMB could also reference calls from elsewhere in the White House.”

-- Trump asked the Supreme Court to review court decisions granting Congress access to his financial records. Robert Barnes reports: “Warning of ‘uncharted territory,’ Trump asked the court for the second time to review rulings from lower courts that have said Congress and state prosecutors have a right to review his personal and business records. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision in favor of the House Oversight and Reform Committee presents the Supreme Court with a ‘case of firsts,’ wrote Trump’s personal lawyer William S. Consovoy. … The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider a related case at its private conference Dec. 13. It involves a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that granted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. similar access to Trump’s financial records, which are held by his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA. The company has said it will comply with final court orders. If the court decides to order full briefing and argument in both cases, it could lead to landmark decisions this term on the ability of prosecutors and Congress to investigate the president. Both subpoenas are independent of the House’s impeachment inquiry.”

-- A federal judge appointed by Trump rejected the Trump administration's efforts to conceal several financial disclosure forms submitted by former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, a cable talking head whom the president tapped to serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer after firing Jeff Sessions. From Politico: “Acting on a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by BuzzFeed, District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled Wednesday that the draft financial disclosures are ineligible for protection under an exemption protecting the confidentiality of policy-making debates. ‘The Court is unpersuaded by DOJ’s 'deliberative process' arguments,’ wrote McFadden ... ‘Whitaker’s draft forms do not bear the mark of the deliberative process.’”

-- Karen McDougal, the former Playboy bunny who says Trump carried on an affair with her while he's been married to Melania Trump, filed a lawsuit against Fox News for alleged defamation. From CNN: “In the lawsuit, which was filed in a New York state court, McDougal accused host Tucker Carlson of acting with a ‘reckless disregard for the truth’ when he suggested on a December 2018 episode of his show that she extorted Trump. In a statement provided by a Fox News spokesperson, the network said it would ‘vigorously defend Tucker Carlson against these meritless claims.’”

-- Notable commentary:

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador meets with Attorney General Bill Barr on Thursday at the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City. (Mexican Presidency/AFP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Attorney General Bill Barr’s meeting in Mexico could be a prelude to greater U.S. involvement in the fight against drug cartels. Kevin Sieff reports: When Barr “met with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Thursday, it marked the highest-level discussion of a matter of bitter disagreement between the two countries: Should drug cartels be designated as terrorist organizations? … For decades, the United States has worked with Mexico to combat drug cartels, helping to develop the very architecture of Mexico’s security apparatus. But with Trump and López Obrador, the dynamic is more complicated than ever before. López Obrador, known by his initials as AMLO, has long rejected a security strategy involving increased militarization, instead endorsing an array of social programs aimed at dissuading would-be cartel members from joining organized crime. Trump, on the other hand, has been talking about a U.S. role in fighting cartels since taking office. …

“After Thursday’s meeting, both sides played down the dispute over the terrorist designation, which could potentially have implications for both U.S. security involvement in Mexico and Mexico’s financial sector, if more comprehensive anti-money laundering policies are applied. … In a news release about the meeting, the Justice Department did not mention the terrorism designation. ... Still, many in Mexico worry about a further emboldening of security forces in the fight against drug traffickers. Over the past decade, that approach has frequently led to the splintering of armed groups and an uptick in violence.”

-- “Pelosi is pushing to strip out sweeping legal protections for online content in the new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, in what would be a blow for big technology companies,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “Internet firms lobbied hard to include the immunity language in the trade agreement, seeing it as a way to extend to Mexico and Canada the broad umbrella of legal protection they enjoy in the U.S.”

-- China will waive tariffs on some U.S. soybeans and pork in a goodwill gesture as the two sides try to reach a broader agreement to defuse their trade war. From Reuters: “The tariff waivers were based on applications by individual firms for U.S. soybeans and pork imports, the finance ministry said in a statement, citing a decision by the country’s cabinet. It did not specify the quantities involved. China had imposed the levies in response to tariffs launched by Washington over allegations that China steals and forces the transfer of American intellectual property to Chinese firms, known as Section 301. That includes tariffs of 25% on both U.S. soybeans and pork in July 2018 and a further 10% on pork and 5% on soybeans in September this year. The waiver comes amid negotiations between the United States and China to conclude a ‘phase one’ or interim deal to de-escalate a 17-month trade war that has roiled financial markets, disrupted supply chains and weighed on global economic growth.”

-- Trump’s bromance with Kim Jong Un appears to be turning sour after the North Korean leader responded to Trump’s “rocket man” diss by invoking the “senile dotard” taunt. Simon Denyer reports: “On Tuesday, Trump jokingly dusted off an old nickname for Kim, calling him ‘Rocket Man’ for his keenness to test his weapons systems. If it was a joke, Pyongyang didn’t get it. North Korea responded angrily on Thursday by threatening to call Trump a senile dotard. The U.S. president ‘has lost politeness to the highest dignity of our republic and dared to use metaphors,’ said Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s vice foreign minister, according to the Korean Central News Agency. … ‘If he uses statements and expressions that intentionally amplify the atmosphere of confrontation at this time of crisis, we will have to diagnose that the dotard started to be senile again,’ she said.”

-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended an off-the-books sit-down meeting with a conservative group that included a number of wealthy Republican donors while he was in London for the NATO summit. From CNN: “The gathering, hosted by the Hamilton Society, conveniently took place in the hotel where Pompeo was staying, situated in a small events space on the second floor. Pompeo slipped into the meeting, without the State Department alerting the press traveling with him about where he was headed or who he was going to meet. … The Hamilton Society is a group of right-leaning American and British business professionals who often invite guest speakers to meet them. The news that he made time to meet with the donors after a busy day visiting with world leaders only serves to heighten speculation that Pompeo may be eyeing a run for the Senate in Kansas next year and as he has become further embroiled in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.”

They said that a $5 million reward is being offered for information that leads to Yakubets’s capture and that it’s the largest such money offering yet for a cyber criminal. Brian Benczkowski, who heads the Justice Department’s criminal division, said Yakubets was the ‘leader of a criminal cyber gang’ and had been involved in cyber crime for the past decade on an ‘unimaginable scale.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Uber has disclosed that 3,000 sexual assaults were reported on its U.S. rides last year, the first time it has revealed the scale of the safety problem that exists at ride-hailing companies. Faiz Siddiqui reports: “The reported assaults were part of Uber’s long-awaited safety study, published Thursday amid widespread and ongoing criticism of its safety practices and pressure to increase its transparency about the issue. In the lengthy report, which divides sexual misconduct into 21 categories but focuses on the five most serious, Uber said it recorded 235 rapes last year and thousands more reports of assault that could involve unwanted touching, kissing or attempted rape. The reports involved drivers and passengers. The company tallied roughly 6,000 reports of those types of assault in 2017 and 2018. … Uber said its data showed that drivers reported instances of sexual assault at the same rate as riders across the five most serious categories it recorded. …

“Uber said there were 107 motor-vehicle fatalities in 2017 and 2018, with a total of 97 fatal crashes involving users on the app. The company also said there were 19 fatal physical assaults over the same time period, during which it said an average of more than 3.1 million trips took place each day. … Lyft has pledged to release a transparency report of its own. … Lyft has faced lawsuits from at least 34 women in San Francisco who allege they were raped or sexually assaulted on rides booked through the app.”

-- In an amicus brief, hundreds of lawyers shared their own abortion stories as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a challenge to Louisiana's assault on reproductive rights. Deanna Paul reports: “Having exercised what they say is their right to a safe and legal abortion, for varied personal and medical reasons, the women said they were compelled to tell the nation’s highest court the role it played in their life trajectories. ‘Becoming a first-generation professional would have been impossible without access to safe and legal abortion services,’ one signer wrote. ‘The ability to make my own choice, to even have a choice, gave me control over my life when I felt like I was utterly powerless.’ … Another described her 31-year-old mother’s death in 1959, after she attempted to perform her own abortion. … Many of the brief’s signers are women with whom the Supreme Court justices went to law school, clerked alongside and employed as clerks. Some are the female attorneys who stand up and argue before them.”

-- A uranium-contaminated site collapsed into the Detroit River last month. From the Detroit Free Press: “Located next to Historic Fort Wayne and leased by Detroit Bulk Storage, the site known as the Detroit Dock allegedly collapsed under the weight of large aggregate piles that were stored at the site during Thanksgiving weekend. The property has been listed by the U.S. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency as a contaminated site due to its use of uranium and other dangerous chemicals during manufacturing dating to the 1940s...""

-- Armed robbers in Florida hijacked a UPS truck and led police on a chase that ended in a fatal shootout. Marisa Iati reports: “The two robbers, a UPS driver and a person in a nearby car were killed in the shooting in Miramar, George Piro, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, told reporters. Police said no officers were killed. A female employee of Regent Jewelers in nearby Coral Gables was injured, that city’s police force said. Her status was not immediately clear, Chief Ed Hudak told reporters. The incident began when Coral Gables police received a silent holdup alarm from the jewelry store in the city’s Miracle Mile section around 4:15 p.m., Hudak said. … The robbers fled north in a truck and, about 20 minutes later, abducted a UPS truck and its driver at gunpoint while the driver was making a delivery in Coral Gables, Hudak said.”

-- California regulators imposed a one-year moratorium banning insurers from dropping policies for homeowners in wildfire-ravaged areas of the state. From the Los Angeles Times: “The move comes amid an exodus of some insurers in communities hard hit by fires, forcing some homeowners to take plans that provide less coverage, sometimes at higher premiums. Some have had to go without insurance altogether. ‘I have heard the same story again and again. People getting dropped by their insurance after decades,’ California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said. ‘To add insult to injury, many struggle to find coverage.’ Though existing law prohibits insurers from dropping policies for homeowners who have suffered a total loss in a wildfire, the moratorium relies on a law that went into effect this year that extends that rule to homeowners who live adjacent to a declared wildfire emergency and did not lose their home.”

Members of St. David’s were deeply disturbed by the hateful graffiti scrawled on the church’s walls. (Suzannah Couch/Brown County Democrat)

-- An investigation into the defacing of a church in Indiana soon after Trump’s election led to an unlikely suspect – and the discovery of a hate crime hoax. Peter Jamison reports: “The knock on Nathan Stang’s door came just after 1 p.m. … ‘Hi, Nathan,’ said Brian Shrader, a deputy with the Brown County Sheriff’s Department. ‘Remember me?’ … It was Shrader who had interviewed him after an appalling act of vandalism at St. David’s Episcopal Church, where Stang played the organ and directed the choir. On the Sunday morning after the 2016 election, Stang had discovered the church’s walls defaced with black spray paint: a swastika, along with the words ‘Heil Trump’ and ‘Fag Church.’ … The graffiti in rural Indiana became a national sensation, part of a string of high-profile hate crime reports in the wake of Trump’s victory. … Stang played music as the spray paint was finally scrubbed off at a ceremony of healing attended by more than 200 people. … As a gay man, Stang had dreaded the unexpected triumph of Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights. …

“When Shrader appeared on his doorstep five months later, in April 2017, Stang was struggling with major depression. Over the winter, he had contemplated suicide. His face — fine-featured and quick to come alive when he sat at the keyboard or stood before a classroom of undergraduates — was covered in dark stubble. … Stang, expressionless, watched the 30-year-old detective’s face. There had been no arrests for the vandalism, and no outward signs that investigators were making progress. But the case had reached a critical juncture, and though Stang didn’t know it, Shrader was surreptitiously recording their conversation. A copy of the video was later provided to The Washington Post. ‘I’ve spent six months on this case, okay? A long time,’ Shrader said slowly. He took a breath and placed his right hand, palm down, on the armrest console that separated them. ‘Based on what I’ve found in this investigation,’ he told the organist, ‘you’re responsible for this.’”

-- West Virginia’s governor is calling for the firing of several corrections employees who are already suspended for performing a Nazi salute in a class photo. Kim Bellware reports: “Gov. Jim Justice (R) said such conduct would not be tolerated. … ‘I have directed Secretary Jeff Sandy of the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety to continue actively investigating this incident, and I have ordered the termination of all those that are found to be involved in this conduct,’ [he told The Post]. Justice was briefed on the matter by Sandy, who announced in a Wednesday letter to DCR employees that several employees had been suspended. … In his letter, Sandy did not discuss how or when the photo came to his attention. The photo, provided to The Post with faces of the participants already blurred out, is labeled as DCR ‘Basic Training Class #18’ that took place from Oct. 21 to Nov. 27.”

-- A former video editor for Infowars host Alex Jones describes in a New York Times essay the tense – and sometimes downright abusive – conditions the conspiracy theorist’s staff worked under as they produced stories based on misinformation and debunked myths. “Working for Jones was a balancing act. You had to determine where he was emotionally and match his tone quickly. If he was angry, then you had better get angry. If he was joking around, then you could relax, sort of, always looking out of the corner of your eye for his mood to turn at any moment. … Ideas for stories mostly came from what other news outlets reported. Jones wanted us to ‘hijack’ the mainstream media’s coverage and use it to our advantage. If it fit into the Infowars narrative, it played,” writes Josh Owens.

In the essay, Owens admits to making up stories about a Muslim community in New York. “We were sent to visit Muslim-majority communities throughout the United States to investigate what Jones instructed us to call ‘the American Caliphate.’ … We landed in Newark at 12:30 p.m. on Dec. 1, 2015. The first stop was Islamberg, a Muslim community three hours north of Manhattan. It was founded in the 1980s by mostly African-American followers of a Pakistani cleric named Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani … Gilani was suspected of association with the organization Jamaat ul-Fuqra, which was briefly designated as a terrorist group by the State Department in the 1990s; Gilani has denied any connection to the group. … But unfounded rumors circulated around far-right corners of the internet that this community was a potential terrorist-training center. Jones, who thought the media consistently ingratiated themselves with Islamic extremists, believed them. … We pulled in, unannounced … Because of the conspiracy theories about the place, Islamberg was a constant target of right-wing extremists … So the phone call we received later that night from a law-enforcement agent shouldn’t have come as a surprise. The officer who contacted us said he simply wanted to verify who we were after receiving a concerned call from someone in Islamberg. … Jones told us to file a story that accused the police of harassment, lending credence to the theory that this community contained dangerous, potential terrorists. I knew this wasn’t the case according to the information we had. We all did.”

The impeachment probe centers on a July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky in which he asked him to investigate the Bidens and their activities in Ukraine as “a favor.”

AD

The investigation has allowed Republicans in Congress to raise the specter of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Though there’s been no evidence found that the Bidens engaged in any wrongdoing in Ukraine, Republicans in Congress are turning more of their attention toward Hunter Biden amid the impeachment inquiry. Two different Senate committees have asked for documents related to his actions, along with transcripts of calls that Biden had as vice president with Ukrainian officials.

AD

A career State Department official, George Kent, testified to Congress that he raised concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest with Hunter Biden working for Burisma but was turned away by a Biden staffer. But Kent also said he had no knowledge of the Bidens acting improperly with Ukraine.

Earlier Thursday, Biden had a heated exchange with an Iowa voter, calling him a “damn liar” when the voter suggested that Burisma hired Hunter Biden to gain access to the Obama White House.

AD

Hunter Biden, in an interview with ABC News in October, said that joining the Burisma board was “poor judgment” because it gave his father’s opponents an opening to attack.

“Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is . . . a swamp in — in — in many ways? Yeah,” Hunter Biden said. “I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That’s where I made the mistake. So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

AD

But Joe Biden has previously refrained from criticizing his son or conceding that it gave the perception of a conflict of interest. Hours after his son’s interview aired in October, Biden was asked several times during a Democratic debate whether his son erred — and whether he should have done more to prevent the potential conflict.

AD

“Look, my son’s statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,” he said. “My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made. I’m proud of what he had to say. And let’s focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump’s corruption. That’s what we should be focusing on.”

In the Telemundo interview, Biden said he was “confident” that Trump violated the Constitution when he asked Zelensky for help.

“And fortunately, even the leader of Ukraine said, ‘There’s nothin’ to check out here. Nothin’ to check’,” Biden said. “Not a single person’s ever suggested there’s anything I did that was anything other than completely in the interest of the United States of America.” Yuri Lutsenko, the former top prosector of Ukraine, told The Post recently that he didn’t believe the Bidens violated any laws.

The latest nefarious doings of none other than William P. Barr and Rudolph W. Giuliani have now forcefully underscored this very point. In so doing, Trump’s attorney general and his personal lawyer — whose roles Trump views as one and the same — have helpfully strengthened the case against Trump.

AD

AD

Two new investigative reports demonstrate that Barr and Giuliani are, in effect, continuing to carry out elements of the very same corrupt scheme for which Trump is currently getting impeached. Their activities have been described as “brazen,” but the truth is worse: They demonstrate with great clarity that Trump’s efforts to corrupt our political system will continue — a reminder of why he’s being impeached in the first place.

Barr hits a snag

The Post reports that Barr has hit a major snag in his efforts to validate Trump’s claim that the investigation into Russian sabotage of the 2016 election was a hoax. Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general, privately asked Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, who’s executing Barr’s review of the origins of that investigation, to validate a key element of Trumpworld’s “theory” of those origins — and he did not.

AD

AD

This is terribly inconvenient for Barr — and Trump and his propagandists. They hope such a review will allow them to cast the whole Russia investigation — and its findings of Russian sabotage and extensive efforts by Trump to coordinate with and benefit from it — as illegitimate.

Central to this is the idea that the Maltese professor who first told a Trump adviser about dirt gathered by Russia on Hillary Clinton — which launched the original FBI probe — was a U.S. agent setting up the Trump campaign. Horowitz, who is also examining the probe’s origins, has reportedly determined that he was not, and asked Durham — and intelligence agencies — to produce evidence to the contrary. They couldn’t.

It’s true that Horowitz will also reportedly announce serious irregularities with the FBI’s original handling of the investigation, and Trump’s propagandists will hype this to the skies. But the bottom line is Horowitz is expected to conclude that the investigation’s basis was legitimate, and while we don’t know what Durham will conclude, it seems clear he’s finding little to validate Trumpworld’s wild theories.

AD

AD

The key point here is that Barr, who is gearing up to cast doubt on Horowitz’s conclusions, is continuing to use the levers of government to carry out Trump’s overall corrupt project — which Trump is actively cheering on. Barr is trying to undercut the legitimacy of the Russia investigation’s conclusions — which would help make Russia’s criminal attack on our political system and Trump’s nefarious reaping of its gains disappear.

That’s exactly what Trump tried to extort Ukraine into helping him do, by announcing an “investigation” into the lie that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered, thus validating that lie — part of the corrupt plot for which he’s being impeached.

Giuliani’s latest moves

Giuliani is doing the same as we speak. The New York Times reports that Giuliani has traveled to Budapest and Kyiv, where he’s meeting with shadowy Ukrainian figures to keep building the case that Joe Biden and his son Hunter acted corruptly in Ukraine.

AD

AD

This line of nonsense has been thoroughly debunked, but Giuliani met with one of its key proponents, and is participating in the filming of a fake “documentary” that’s designed to make that narrative seem true.

In other words, Giuliani — who was the ringleader of the scheme to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that would also make that narrative seem true — has continued to try to achieve the same goals that drove the corrupt plot for which Trump is being impeached.

This, in and of itself, does not necessarily add to the case for impeachment. But, tellingly, when the Times pressed Giuliani to say whether he kept Trump informed of these latest moves, he refused to answer, even though he had previously kept Trump regularly apprised. That means it’s possible Trump has blessed Giuliani’s continued efforts to smear Biden with lies, though without the direct extortion element.

AD

AD

Trump’s intent is corrupt

All of this reinforces the corrupt intent that Trump has exhibited throughout. Republicans still laughably claim Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky only because he cared about “corruption” in Ukraine. But this shows again that Trump’s primary concern has been to achieve announcements of investigations into only the things that would help him politically.

In his July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Trump directed him to talk to Barr and Giuliani, who would, Trump hoped, act as his henchmen in helping Zelensky carry out those investigations. The two have simply continued to carry out this very same effort on Trump’s behalf.

AD

Even as Trump is getting impeached for using the power of his office to falsify the story of his corruption of our last election and to corrupt the next one, he’s still trying to accomplish both goals. And in Barr’s case, he’s cheerfully continuing to rely on the manipulation of the levers of government to do so.

Judging by what I’ve heard from Democrats, which dovetails with many news accounts, it appears the basic contours of the argument are over whether to include just two articles mainly focused on the Ukraine scandal, or to add a third that brings in obstruction of justice.

AD

The first two are likely to prompt consensus among Democrats. The first would charge that Trump abused his power by using the weight of his office to corruptly extort Ukraine into announcing investigations that were solely designed to satisfy his various political needs — validating lies absolving Russia of 2016 electoral sabotage and smearing potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.

That would likely include the conditioning of official acts — a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid — to pressure Ukraine, and the enlistment of multiple Cabinet officials and top White House advisers in the scheme.

AD

The second article would charge that Trump obstructed Congress’s efforts to learn the truth through maximal resistance to any and all subpoenas, and through blocking testimony from numerous figures who had first hand knowledge, among other things, of Trump’s decision to freeze the military aid to extort Ukraine.

AD

Some Democrats, however, want a third article included, which would also charge Trump with obstruction of justice, based in part on the special counsel report, which documented numerous episodes of such obstruction, some of which were shockingly lawless.

But some moderates in difficult districts appear to oppose including this third article. As Politico reports, those moderates see peril in including anything from the special counsel report, because it smacks of relitigating 2016.

AD

As one Democrat from a GOP-leaning district put it, “Activities from the 2016 election, I think, should be left to voters in the 2020 election.”

This would be a terrible mistake. It would squander an important advantage Democrats have right now.

One of the most powerful aspects of the case Democrats have built is that Trump is serially corrupt. He has abused his power again and again and again. He has repeatedly dangled official acts to solicit more foreign interference in the election after working extensively to coordinate with and benefit from the same last time around.

AD

Trump enlisted large swaths of the government in carrying out this scheme (the State Department, budget officials) and in covering it up (his Justice Department tried to bury the whistleblower complaint, and numerous Cabinet officials are refusing to testify and turn over documents).

AD

The obstruction of justice documented by the special counsel isn’t floating out in some other separate galaxy called “2016.” It is part of the same story we’re seeing right now and that will continue going forward, potentially through 2020 and beyond. In that story, Trump has worked to corrupt both elections on his own behalf and has corruptly tried to cover all of it up.

By rubbing our faces in his corruption, by defiantly asserting there was nothing wrong with his pressure on Ukraine, by blithely calling on Ukraine — and China — to investigate Biden after his scheme had been unmasked, Trump has flagrantly signaled he will continue using the levers of government to corrupt the next election.

AD

This pattern is powerful. The extensive obstruction of justice to obscure outside sabotage of 2016 runs right into his current obstruction of the investigation into his corrupt efforts to solicit outside interference in the next election. All together, it tells a story of shocking betrayal of the country.

AD

Those constitutional scholars demonstrated powerfully that this pattern of abuses is what signals that Trump represents a continuing threat to our free and fair elections, and that this requires the remedy of impeachment.

“The President has engaged in a pattern of abusing the trust placed in him by the American people by soliciting foreign countries — including China, Russia, and Ukraine — to investigate his political opponents and interfere on his behalf in elections,” testified Professor Michael Gerhardt.

AD

Arguably, establishing this pattern would be even more forceful if it included Trump’s abuses of his office to line his pockets — his nonstop profiteering off the presidency.

AD

But for now, let’s just note that failing to include obstruction of justice would paradoxically weaken the case Democrats are making on the Ukraine scandal itself. Moderates hopefully will see that this would also weaken the case they will have to make — both substantively and politically — to their voters as well.

It fell by 3 points for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to 14%, and it declined by 1 point to 6% for Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. Bloomberg, a billionaire media mogul, entered the race as the fifth-most popular candidate with 4% support. Support for Warren dropped by 2 points to 9% in the national poll, the worst showing for the U.S. senator from Massachusetts in the Reuters/Ipsos poll since August.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) is at 4 percent as well.

This is one poll — a national poll at that, but still. If one looks at either state or national polling, Warren’s numbers have dropped significantly over the last few months. The media have been so fascinated with the “Biden is faltering” meme that they seem to have ignored the bigger, more accurate assessment: Warren has been in decline as Sanders and Buttigieg rise. In the RealClearPolitics averages, Warren is third in both Iowa and New Hampshire, both races she looked poised to win just weeks ago. Unlike Biden, who can afford a mediocre showing and wait for states with high percentages of African Americans, Warren so far is not pulling heavily from nonwhite voters.

AD

AD

The reasons for her decline are several: Her botched Medicare-for-all plan, an overreliance on plans (when others now have plenty of plans as well), questions about electability (tied to Medicare-for-all) and the rise of fresher candidates who are more interesting. Certainly she is still in the top tier and has the organization and money to potentially prevail, but if you believe in political momentum, hers is going in reverse.

It is worth stressing that the parade of debates has not helped the primary electorate settle on a favorite. When nearly a third of voters are still undecided, you wonder if some of the dropouts might have hung around for a while. (Klobuchar is the quintessential example of a candidate who is stuck in low single digits but just keeps chugging along; she isn’t yet in the top tier, but she at least is going in the right direction.) It is also possible that when candidates leave the race, voters, even ones for whom the departing candidate was the top pick, reassess. So who is left now? What’s my choice? People are intuitively illogical in that they can prefer A to B and B to C, but not A to C. (A voter might say, “Hey, I like Warren more than Biden, Biden more that Klobuchar, but whoops, I’d take Klobuchar over Warren.”)

Throw in one more possible reset moment: As of now, it looks like only six (maybe up to eight) candidates will qualify for the December debate stage. Perhaps that will help voters settle on a favorite. Certainly it is easier to choose one of six than one of 12. Those candidates who do not make the stage — some for the second time (e.g., Julián Castro) — may finally have to call it quits. Where those voters land is anyone’s guess.

AD

AD

In sum, less than 60 days out from the Iowa caucuses, the race is entirely up in the air. It’s good news for Warren that voters are still kicking the tires; the bad news is some voters have already bypassed her.

Warren takes medication for hypothyroidism, a common condition in which the thyroid gland is underactive, according to the letter. Her blood pressure is 115/57, and she has had a flu shot this year.

Warren is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 129 pounds. “She exercises regularly and follows a healthy diet despite her very busy schedule,” Woo wrote.

In addition to the letter from her physician, which is similar to what most recent presidential candidates have offered, Warren also provided a hematology report including information on everything from her platelet count to the size of her red blood cells.

The health of the presidential candidates has taken on more significance this year because the field is historically old, with four Democratic contenders who are 70 or over. Three of them — Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden — are polling toward the top of the field.

AD

The nominee will take on President Trump, who holds the record as the oldest man to assume the presidency and is now 73.

AD

Though Trump has had doctors who describe his health in glowing terms, he recently made an unplanned stop at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for reasons that remain unclear. Trump’s doctor described the visit as a “interim checkup.”

Sanders, at 78, is the oldest candidate in the race. He suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, which sidelined him until a Democratic debate two weeks later. Sanders had two stents inserted, but his campaign has declined to specify how much damage his heart sustained and declined interview requests with his physician.

AD

The Vermont senator’s campaign has said it would provide his health records by the end of the year. Sanders released a letter in January 2016 — during his last presidential campaign — from Brian Monahan, the attending physician to the U.S. Congress, that described Sanders as having a “mild” case of high cholesterol.

Biden, another top Democratic contender at 77 years old, has also faced persistent questions about his health. The latest came Thursday at a campaign stop in Iowa, when a former farmer confronted him about his age and other topics.

“You’re damn near as old as I am,” the man said. “You’re too old for the job. I’m 83, and I know damn well I don’t have the mental faculties I did 30 years ago.”

Biden replied, “I’m not sedentary.” He added, “And you want to check my shape, man, let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. Okay?”

After a debate in September in which his answers sometimes meandered and one challenger appeared to allude to his age, Biden committed to releasing his health records ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. When asked by reporters the following day about concerns regarding his metal acuity, Biden deflected.

AD

“What the hell concerns?” Biden asked. “Man, you want to wrestle?”

Billionaire and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the most recent candidate to enter the race, is also among the oldest at 77 years old. A spokesman for Bloomberg said the candidate will release his health records during the Democratic primary, but did not specify when.

AD

As mayor, Bloomberg made provisions for healthy living part of his agenda. That includes a “soda ban” he pushed in New York, intended to prevent restaurants and food service establishments in the city from selling “sugary beverages” in cups larger than 16 ounces.

In contrast, the other contender at the top of the Democratic field — South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — is among the youngest presidential candidates in history at 37.

Pelosi did not detail a specific timeline or how expansive the articles of impeachment would be. House Democrats have considered charges that include obstruction and bribery, according to congressional aides, as they continue to debate internally over widening the articles to cover Trump’s conduct outlined in then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation as evidence that the president has repeatedly obstructed justice and solicited or welcomed foreign interference in his election bids.

The aides cautioned that the situation remains fluid. But Democratic leaders believe they have overwhelming support for articles dealing with the core of Trump’s conduct regarding Ukraine, according to two leadership aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. Lawyers from the House Intelligence Committee, which drafted a 300-page report detailing Trump’s alleged misconduct, will present the official findings in another highly anticipated hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday.

Leading Democrats, including Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), have already identified as bribery and an abuse of office that rises to the “high crimes and misdemeanors” standard Trump’s effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch political investigations advantageous to Trump.

AD

AD

Democrats allege Trump withheld a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine in the face of Russian military aggression, to force Zelensky to order official inquiries into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

There is no appetite for trying to impeach Trump on grounds of treason, the third specific act listed in the Constitution’s definition of impeachable offenses, according to people familiar with the plans.

While Pelosi’s announcement was expected for weeks, it still marked a moment in American history. Only two of the previous 43 presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was convicted by the Senate and removed from office. Trump is likely to meet a similar fate, but the Senate trial would nonetheless occur less than a year before Election Day and will add another level of partisan animosity to a campaign that already promises to be full of rancor.

Trump on Thursday dared Democrats to act quickly, turning his focus to the Senate, where the White House has already previewed an aggressive defense strategy that could entail calling witnesses to the chamber floor.

“They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy,” Trump tweeted. “Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business.”

Trump demanded to call as witnesses an array of Republican targets, including Pelosi, Schiff and the Bidens. Republicans have also floated summoning the whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine triggered the impeachment inquiry.

AD

Later at the White House, Trump dismissed any notion he is concerned that impeachment would tarnish his legacy.

AD

“It’s a hoax. It’s a hoax. It’s a big, fat hoax,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters that came during a meeting with U.N. representatives.

The entire GOP apparatus mounted a fierce defense of Trump as soon as Pelosi announced House Democrats’ next steps Thursday morning, with both Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, warning of political repercussions for Democrats in next November’s elections.

“Working Americans and their families are not well-served by Democrats’ political performance art. What they really need, what they really need, are results,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in response to Pelosi’s announcement. “The only path to results is bipartisan legislation.”

Pelosi, who confirmed shortly after her impeachment announcement that the House will vote next week on a bill to lower prescription drug prices, played down any potential political retribution for Democrats at the polls.

“This has absolutely nothing to do with politics,” she said.

House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) also suggested Thursday that Democrats would be free to vote as they choose on articles of impeachment without pressure from party leadership, saying in a statement that “this is not an issue that we are going to whip.”

But tensions over the impeachment inquiry and the contentious clash between the parties burst further into public view on Thursday when a reporter pressed Pelosi on whether she hates Trump — an accusation leveled by Republicans against the speaker and other Democrats.

AD

“This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the president’s violation of his oath of office. And as a Catholic, I resent your using the word ‘hate’ in a sentence that addresses me. I don’t hate anyone,” an agitated Pelosi responded to the reporter, James Rosen of the Sinclair Broadcast Group. “And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.”

Trump, clearly following the day’s news developments, responded shortly after on Twitter, taunting Pelosi for what he called a “nervous fit.”

“She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more,” the president tweeted. “Stock Market and employment records. She says she ‘prays for the President.’ I don’t believe her, not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?”

The tensions also spilled onto the Democratic presidential campaign trail, when Joe Biden — campaigning in New Hampton, Iowa — engaged in an extraordinary exchange with an Iowa voter who pressed him on his son’s activities in Ukraine.

The younger Biden sat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, whose owner had come under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. As vice president at the time, Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden. But the Iowa farmer who challenged the former vice president accused him of “selling access” through Hunter Biden’s seat on Burisma’s board, even though there is no evidence Joe Biden played any role in getting him the job.

AD

“We all know Trump has been messing around in the Ukraine over there, holding their foreign aid . . . saying they’re going to investigate you,” said the man, who declined to identify himself. “But you, on the other hand, sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company — that he had no experience with gas or nothing — to get access to the president. You’re selling access to the president, just like he was.”

Biden quickly responded.

“You’re a damn liar, man. That’s not true. And no one has ever said that,” he responded.

In an interview with Telemundo, Biden acknowledged that his son’s board posts “may have looked bad but wasn’t anything wrong” and contrasted it with Trump’s efforts to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

“Can you imagine that?” Biden said in the interview. “It’s like sayin’ to a governor in a state, ‘You have a tragedy; unless you agree to support me next time I run, I’m not gonna bring any — I’m not gonna allow any federal aid to come to help your citizens.’ Come on.”

Hunter Biden’s position on the Burisma board has become a major point of scrutiny for Republicans, who have been seeking to turn the tables against Democrats on impeachment, particularly once the fight shifts to the Senate. To that end, Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani met Thursday in Ukraine with one of the key figures working to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden.

The lawmaker, Andriy Derkach, posted on Facebook photographs of himself meeting Giuliani in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, vowing to set up an anti-corruption group in the Ukrainian parliament. Giuliani’s presence in Ukraine advances efforts by Trump allies to create an alternative narrative in the rapidly moving impeachment investigation.



But top Republicans have declined to answer why the GOP did not investigate the Bidens over the issue when they held both congressional majorities in 2017 and 2018 if they are so concerned about it now.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) repeatedly dismissed the fact that information about the Bidens’ actions regarding Ukraine was public knowledge well before 2019, including in several news accounts.

“Did you know any of the information?” he said in response to a question from a reporter after his weekly news conference."

The convergence of impeachment proceedings and presidential politics is without precedent, with five of the 15 contenders for the Democratic nomination looking for creative ways to remain in the mix in early-voting states while spending most of their time back in Washington.

For the five senators, the impeachment trial poses an asymmetric threat. While they are in Washington six days a week as jurors in what could be a multiweek impeachment trial, the 10 remaining candidates will be free to swarm across Iowa, New Hampshire and other states. Former vice president Joe Biden could also be swept up in the impeachment swirl, forced to defend himself and his son Hunter from escalating attacks from Republicans.

No state looms larger than Iowa, where the Feb. 3 caucuses have tended to reward candidates who forge a personal bond with voters. Some Democrats say the absence of the senators — including Warren (D-Mass.) and Sanders (I-Vt.), who polls show are at or near the top of the pack — could present an opening for Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. Both also rank toward the top of polls there, and neither will have competing job responsibilities in January. (Buttigieg’s tenure as mayor ends in January.)

“I don’t think it’s like a death sentence for many of the senators, but it’s certainly an opportunity for Biden and Buttigieg to make up some of the ground game and put some points on the board,” said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats.

Already, the entire field is urgently stockpiling endorsements, sharpening attacks and pouring money into television ads in recognition of the fact that the next several weeks — a time frame already split by the holidays — could be their final chance to leave a lasting impression with voters before an all-consuming trial begins early next year.

“I can barely imagine how nerve-racking and stressful it is,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said of the plight of his Senate colleagues. “The organizers of events are all going to say, ‘If you fail to be at this event, you’ve lost.’ They’re all jealous lovers.”

The stark logistical and political challenges factored into the recent exit from the contest of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have caused anxiety among the remaining campaign strategists and candidates. As Sanders bluntly put it last month: “It will make my life and other senators’ lives more difficult.”

AD

The impeachment proceedings also underscore a unique challenge Democratic candidates have struggled against this year: They have frequently found themselves eclipsed both by Trump’s explosive controversies and congressional Democrats’ response, making it difficult for most to attract enough notice to break out from the pack. A top strategist on a Democratic campaign privately vented frustration about this trend Thursday.

Now the candidates have a different hurdle to clear — how to ensure a continued presence in the early states that have historically played an outsize role in determining who wins the nomination.

If the Senate is presented with articles of impeachment, according to the chamber’s rules, senators would consider them every day but Sunday starting at 1 p.m., unless otherwise ordered. Republican and Democratic aides and senators cautioned this week that all of the particulars — including trial length and witnesses — are up in the air.

The Democratic senators running for president have promised to be there. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) gave a presentation to Democratic senators on Wednesday about the mechanics of an impeachment trial, according to two people familiar with meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private discussion. According to one of the people, members were shown video clips from President Bill Clinton’s 1999 impeachment trial, which lasted five weeks.

A trial is expected to begin in early January — about the time candidates would normally begin camping out in the states where they think they have the best early shot. For Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who received positive reviews in the last debate and is getting a closer look from some voters, Iowa is crucial.

Klobuchar said she would rely on supporters such as her husband, her daughter and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to help campaign for her in January, noting that Walz used to represent a congressional district on the border with Iowa. She is also considering video appearances.

“I’m going to deploy them, and I’m going to go myself when I can,” Klobuchar said in an interview. “I’m sure there will be some late-night planes.”

Iowa is also seen as a crucial battleground for Warren, who has an aggressive field operation in the state. “We are looking at all options,” said Warren communications director Kristen Orthman, who raised the possibility of travel by Warren’s husband, Bruce Mann, and remote appearances by Warren. Mann normally keeps a lower public profile than the spouses of other top contenders.

Sanders also has focused intensely on Iowa, where he has been running TV ads in recent weeks and plans to spend the next several days. He campaigned with Ocasio-Cortez there last month, drawing large and enthusiastic crowds.

AD

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a co-chair of the Sanders campaign, said Ocasio-Cortez could “absolutely” help fill in or amplify his message during a trial. “It’s going to be an advantage for him in the sense that he has a strong grass-roots organization that is fueled organically and [is] least dependent on the personality of the candidate,” Khanna said in an interview.

“I’m here to ask for your support. Let me be more blunt. I’m asking you when your caller ID is showing that some pollster’s calling you, pick up the phone and answer,” said Booker, who needs strong results in public surveys to qualify for this month’s debate.

Booker is considering tele-town halls as an option for January and intends to be in Iowa as much as possible, according to a person familiar with his plans. Like others interviewed for this story, the person spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.

The fifth senator in the race, Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), is increasingly focused less on Iowa than New Hampshire, about half the distance and flying time from Washington. The shorter commute means Bennet could arrange weeknight events during the trial without missing any of the proceedings.

For Biden, the impeachment trial presents a different kind of challenge. Some Republicans are looking to draw attention to Joe and Hunter Biden, as they seek to defend Trump’s decision to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to “look into” the two. Senate Republicans have privately debated whether they should use the trial to scrutinize the Bidens, who have not been accused by any authorities of wrongdoing.

Asked Wednesday whether Republicans should press for them to testify, Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said, “I don’t know if decisions have been made about that.”

AD

He added, “If I’m Joe Biden, I think I’m going to be anxious to have this get behind us pretty quickly.”

Biden got into a startling exchange Thursday with an Iowa farmer who challenged him on Hunter Biden’s activities in Ukraine, prompting Biden to call the man “a damn liar.”

Some Democrats have expressed worry about the added burden of Biden having to defend himself, even though the Republican allegations are unsubstantiated. Biden’s supporters said they expect his campaign to continue to mount a vigorous defense. “I don’t think the Biden campaign is the least bit worried about something that has no merit to it,” said Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), a Biden supporter.

Another variable that all the candidates may have to confront is whether an impeachment trial changes the way voters think about the candidates and the primary. Although impeachment has dominated Congress’s focus, it has generated less interest so far on the campaign trail, where candidates don’t dwell on it and voters rarely pose questions on the topic.

“People are asking about trade. People are asking about health care. It’s just not on people’s mind,” said Alan Feirer, chairman of the Madison County Democrats in Iowa. “I don’t know how much of a difference it’s going to make.”

Though the primary focus of attention in the impeachment saga is how the House proceeds toward formal articles of impeachment, the Senate’s role if Trump is in fact impeached is important and controversial as well. Just ask Bill Clinton — or the ghost of Andrew Johnson — since both of these impeached presidents were acquitted by the Senate. How a Senate trial will actually play out is a complicated question.

What Does the Constitution Say About an Impeachment Trial?

It’s helpful to understand that for both chambers, the U.S. Constitution doesn’t spell out a whole lot beyond specifying that the House has the “sole power” to impeach executive and judicial branch officials for “Treason, Bribery, and other High Crimes and Misdemeanors” and that the Senate has the “sole power” to remove impeached officials by a two-thirds vote if they are found guilty of such charges. We know that the Founders also provided that for presidential impeachments the chief justice of the Supreme Court will be the Senate’s presiding officer, which was intended to avoid putting a vice-president, who might inherit the presidency if a removal did occur, in the chair. So the two things we absolutely know from the Constitution are that Chief Justice John Roberts will preside over a trial and that Trump can only be removed from office if two-thirds of the Senate votes to eject him. Beyond that, House and Senate rules, and ad hoc decisions made by the two chambers about matters not specified in the rules, decide pretty much everything other than the evidence itself.

Does the Senate Have to Hold a Trial If the House Impeaches Trump?

Constitutional authorities differ on this question, which is germane because Trump himself keeps claiming that any House impeachment over the Ukraine scandal (and probably anything else) is “unconstitutional” or at least unwarranted. In theory, the man who runs the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, could agree with that assessment and refuse to hold a trial. And because the courts are extremely reluctant to intervene in “political questions” involving executive–legislative collisions, he might get away with it.

But in fact, McConnell has repeatedly said he would indeed hold a trial — too many times to reverse himself, in all probability, as the Hill reports:

“Under the impeachment rules of the Senate, we’ll take the matter up. The chief justice will be in the chair … We intend to do our constitutional responsibility,” he said.

McConnell had previously indicated that he would have “no choice” but to take up impeachment if the House passes articles, though he has also [run] a Facebook ad over the recent two-week recess positioning himself and the GOP-controlled Senate as a roadblock to Trump being removed from office.

Could the Senate Have a Perfunctory or Truncated Trial?

Again, McConnell has been talking as though there will be a real trial, but means are available to cut it short, as Democrats tried to do during the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton. Trump reportedly favored that strategy, initially, but in a November 21 meeting between White House representatives and Senate Republicans after two weeks of public testimony in the House, sentiment for at least a pro forma trial prevailed, and a tentative plan for a two-week trial was agreed upon.

Now that Nancy Pelosi has publicly announced articles of impeachment will be drafted and acted upon in the House Judiciary Committee, Trump is suddenly talking about an extended trial in which he, his attorneys, and his Senate allies will not simply defend him but will seek to place Joe and Hunter Biden and perhaps other leading Democrats on trial as well (echoing House Republican demands that Adam Schiff and other Trump tormenters be hauled in to testify about their persecution of the president). A true show trial of Democrats may well be a bridge too far for Senate Republicans. But to the extent that Trump can claim dragging the Bidens into the dock is necessary to document the corruption he claims he was seeking to root out in pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate them, a compliant Senate Republican majority and a Chief Justice trying not to become too central to the proceedings might allow it to happen. But that gets to the murky situation with respect to many aspects of a Senate impeachment trial.

What Governs the Conduct of the Senate Trial?

Regardless of how it begins or ends, the trial itself is governed by standing Senate rules, last modified in 1986. They are largely based on precedents set in the Andrew Johnson trial. The basic idea is that articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate by House impeachment managers, and are then disputed by counsel for the president, with senators observing but not becoming directly involved (other than by written questions submitted to one or both of the parties). Witnesses are called and cross-examined according to protocols and timelines adopted by the Senate just before the trial begins on a majority vote. During the Clinton impeachment proceedings, they were (somewhat miraculously) adopted by unanimous consent, in part because the outcome of the trial was in zero doubt. Even though the outcome of a Trump trial may also be preordained (e.g., acquittal on a more or less party-line vote), any bipartisan procedural agreements are unlikely.

And so, as I noted recently, the scope of the trial, and rules for calling, examining and cross-examining witnesses, are really up in the air, and may depend on how disciplined Republicans (who hold 53 Senate seats) are in doing what the White House and Mitch McConnell tell them to do:

Chief Justice John Roberts, who according to the Constitution will be sworn in as the chief presiding officer (but not the “judge” — the Senate itself is the judge and the jury), can rule on matters of procedure and evidence, but can also be overruled by 51 senators at any time. What will not be in play are the normal rules of evidence in criminal and civil trials; impeachment trials are their own beast.

Are Senators Under a Gag Order on Impeachment?

One aspect of the trial procedure as spelled out by the standing rules was alluded to by McConnell in his discussions with his Republican colleagues earlier this year:

McConnell … warned that senators won’t be allowed to speak because they are jurors. McConnell said such silence “would be good therapy for a number of them.”

More accurately, senators are like jurors — and judges, too — in that they observe the back-and-forth between House managers and their lawyers and the president and his lawyers and don’t have an opportunity to speak until they go into a closed session to deliberate. The standing rules also provide that when it comes time to vote, each senator stands by her or his desk and simply announces “guilty” or “not guilty” on each article of impeachment.

It’s also worth keeping in mind that Senate’s standing rules are subject to amendment, which would normally require a supermajority. But as Bob Bauer observed at Lawfare blog, there are ways around that problem for a devious operator like McConnell:

Senate leadership can seek to have the rules “reinterpreted” at any time by the device of seeking a ruling of the chair on the question, and avoiding a formal revision of the rule that would require supermajority approval. The question presented in some form would be whether, under the relevant rules, the Senate is required to hold an impeachment “trial” fully consistent with current rules — or even any trial at all. A chair’s ruling in the affirmative would be subject to being overturned by a majority, not two-thirds, vote.

In any event, the “silence” expected of senators is not imposed until the articles of impeachment are passed by the House and presented to the Senate — i.e., until the trial begins. So when you hear senators say they won’t comment on impeachment charges or the possibility of “impeachable offenses” having been committed to avoid prejudging a “case” they may try as “jurors,” that’s a purely voluntary and informal assertion. From the perspective of the Constitution and the standing Senate rules, they can run their mouths all they want before and after the trial. But some may choose to hide behind the “prospective juror” fiction to keep their own counsel, as became clear when Lindsey Graham proposed sending a letter to Nancy Pelosi informing her that the Senate had no intention of removing Trump from office over the Ukraine scandal, as the Hill reported:

Several, including Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), have declined to weigh in on the impeachment proceedings and admonished their colleagues who have already made a decision.

Collins, one of two GOP senators up for reelection in a state won by Hillary Clinton, told reporters in Maine that it was “entirely inappropriate” for senators to be taking a position.

Romney declined to comment on Wednesday on Graham’s letter, but he said last week that he was going to keep “an open mind” on impeachment.

“It’s a purposeful effort on my part to stay unbiased, and to see the evidence as it’s brought forward,” he said.

Other Senate Republicans are reportedly raining on Graham’s parade, not because they believe they are required to remain silent but because they don’t want to display any Republican disunity or place vulnerable senators on record this early in the process.

What’s unclear is whether the tradition of senators not speaking during the trial imposes some sort of restriction on comments during evenings, early mornings, Sundays or other times the trial is not in session. This question is of particular importance to the Democratic senators (currently six of them) who are running for president. The trial will undoubtedly interfere with their campaign activities, but it’s unclear whether some ad hoc Senate rule or ruling from the presiding officer (the Chief Justice) will constrain their free speech rights until the final vote.

When Will the Trial, If There Is One, Begin and End?

With the House now considering Xmas as the practical deadline for ending its part of the impeachment-and-removal process, the Senate is looking at a January trial. The length of pas trials has been variable, as I recently observed:

The Johnson impeachment trial in 1868 lasted from March 5 until May 16, when the Senate’s first crucial “test vote” on a catch-all article of impeachment failed by one vote. Ten days later the Senate voted predictably to acquit on two other articles, and subsequently voted for general acquittal and adjournment.

Clinton’s impeachment trial was more hurried: It began on January 7, 1999, when presiding officer Chief Justice William Rehnquist was sworn in, and ended on February 12, with Clinton’s easy acquittal on both articles (45 senators, all Republicans, voted for his guilt on the perjury article, with ten Republicans defecting; and 50 senators vote for the obstruction article, with five Republicans defecting).

The final votes in the Senate will be dramatic but largely anticlimactic, like those in the Clinton trial, more than likely. It takes just one “guilty” verdict to remove a president from office, but that requires 67 votes–or in this case, the defection of 20 Republican senators. Even if a handful of Republican senators (e.g., Romney or a few colleagues who face tough 2020 challenges like Collins and Gardner) declare their independence, Trump will be free to claim exoneration and seek vindication next November as the newly triumphant chieftain of his defiant MAGA constituency.

But the group isn’t completely adrift. “We said if somehow this one doesn’t work out we’ll go with that one,” said Scott, who said they’ve been closely monitoring two other candidates. “We go deep into planning.”

Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next.

The California senator left the race after support and fundraising slumped — but after nearly 11 months she had amassed a well-regarded bounty of supporters, particularly among black Democrats.

AD

The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters.

AD

At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women.

The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.

AD

“I don’t know who needs to hear this but stay the [expletive] away from the Harris field,” wrote Dvorsky on Twitter. “Of course you want them to work for you. They’re freaking amazing. And sad. And grieving. Sit all the way down. They know where you live. They’ll get back to. Or not.”

A spokesman for Harris didn’t reply to questions about whether she would endorse another candidate in the race.

AD

By 9 a.m. Wednesday, less than a day after Harris’s surprise departure became public, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign announced he had won the endorsement of Mitch Henry, a key Iowa figure who had been a member of Harris’s Iowa Latinx steering committee.

In the hours after Harris left the race, everyone from her finance team, to a local South Carolina gun control activist to members of Congress who had sided with her were hearing pitches.

AD

Four campaigns — and one presidential candidate — reached out to Iowa state Rep. Ross Wilburn of Ames within 24 hours of Harris leaving the race.

“It was just offers of support, one or two with more of a pointed ‘here’s what my candidate brings to the table,’ ” Wilburn said, adding that he received a call from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and campaign officials representing former vice president Joe Biden, former Maryland congressman John Delaney, and Sens. Warren and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

AD

Other Harris supporters also were girding for a full-court press from candidates, with Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, warning the white candidates not to “pander.”

AD

“What have you done in the past that will give me an indication of what you will do in the future for people of color?” Fudge asked, explaining what she wants to hear. “A lot of people have great plans. But if you put a plan together without the input of the very people you say you want to help, that is just as pandering to me as anything else.”

“We like Warren. We like Sanders. We like Biden. We like our neighbor in South Bend,” said another caucus member, Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.), referring to Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of the Indiana city. “We’re just deciding which one we like the most at the moment.”

AD

During her campaign, Harris didn’t fit neatly into a particular ideological lane, meaning that there was no single obvious beneficiary of her departure.

AD

In South Carolina, some observers assume much of Harris’s support could go to Biden, who already is well known among African Americans there.

But Warren also is positioned to benefit, said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a group trying to elevate women of color in American politics.

“She’s been focusing on intersectional policies that directly address race and gender,” Allison said. “Warren and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders are beneficiaries of the latest dynamic.”

Many of Harris’s donors were already looking elsewhere. Roughly half of more than 100 well-connected fundraisers who raised at least $25,000 for Harris’s campaign also gave the maximum donation to some of her Democratic rivals, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.

AD

AD

Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic donor, jumped on board with Harris shortly after her campaign launched in Oakland in January. But later, Buell also supported Buttigieg.

When asked about Harris’s campaign shortly before she dropped out of the race, Buell said in a text message: “Sad that Kamala didn’t do better but she wasn’t ready.”

Buell added on Wednesday that she is now fully backing Buttigieg: “I am seeing his effective, creative campaign as a symbol of his leadership qualities. The energy and focus in the campaign is very positive and impressive.”

The ultimate fight will be for the individual voters who backed Harris, including people like Vanessa Phelan, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mother of two from Des Moines.

AD

Not long after Harris dropped out, texts started to come in from organizers of other campaigns. “It was, like, ‘Not today Satan,’ ” she said.

AD

Phelan said she will eventually settle on another candidate but isn’t sure when. The hardest part of Harris’s decision to quit, she said, was explaining it to her 4-year-old daughter Zoe.

“Kamala ran out of money,” Phelan told her.

The little girl looked at her mother with wide eyes, trying to understand. “I’ll give Kamala my piggy bank,” her mother recalled Zoe saying. “I want her to be president.”

The connection to the Ukraine campaign is also troubling because of how Moscow could exploit knowledge that Trump was secretly engaged in efforts to extract political favors from the government in Kyiv.

He was handing Russia the material with which to blackmail him because he wanted to conceal his calls and ensure there would be no record of the calls, which is about the best evidence of consciousness of guilt you are ever going to find. (“When Trump realized that this enabled [chief of staff John] Kelly to compile daily logs of his calls, and the identities of those he was speaking to, Trump became annoyed and reverted to using his cellphone, officials said. ‘He was totally paranoid that everyone knew who he was talking to,’ a former senior administration official said.”)

His own advisers recognize the threat to national security. (“Trump’s conduct has become a matter of renewed concern among senior officials at the White House after repeated attempts to break him of his habit of speaking on his own cellphone or to others using unsecured lines.”)

That is one factual nugget that should be included in the articles of impeachment, especially if endangering national security is included (e.g. illegally preventing authorized aid from reaching an ally seeking to defend against Russian aggression). Perhaps the topic is deserving of a supplementary House Intelligence Committee hearing.

That is not the only new evidence that should be considered in drafting articles of impeachment. Unbelievably, Giuliani is back in Ukraine still digging for imaginary dirt to use against Trump’s political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. The Post reports:

AD

AD

President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani met Thursday in Ukraine with one of the key figures working to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden, the Ukraine lawmaker said, after posting Facebook photographs of himself with the former New York mayor. Andriy Derkach said he pressed Giuliani on the need to set up a joint U.S.-Ukraine investigation into corruption in Ukraine at the meeting in Kyiv. Derkach also vowed to set up an anti-corruption group in the Ukraine parliament.

Just in case you had any doubt that Trump would continue to corrupt our election system unless removed from office, here is evidence that he will not even wait for the Senate trial before pressing forward with his requests for foreign help. Moreover, the notion that Trump is fighting corruption is made even more preposterous by sending his attorney to conspire with Derkach, who allegedly has “associations with Ukrainian security services and an allegedly corrupt pharmaceutical firm” and who has opposed anti-corruption efforts.

But it gets worse (better?). “Giuliani tweeted that U.S. assistance to Ukraine on anti-corruption reforms could face a ‘major obstacle’ until the ‘conversation about corruption in Ukraine’ is resolved. Giuliani alleged ‘compelling’ evidence of criminal misdeeds by Biden, but gave no specifics.” In other words, the Trump-Giuliani team is still using “corruption” as euphemism for “investigating Biden."" Moreover, in the absence of Trump telling Giuliani to knock it off, one must conclude that Trump has fully authorized this approach. Trump is still soliciting, through his attorney, foreigners to meddle in our election in violation of campaign finance rules that prohibit solicitation or receipt of anything of “value” from foreign nationals.

Does Secretary of State Mike Pompeo know and approve of Giuliani’s skulduggery? Is he party to it? Unfortunately, Trump prevents him and all other Cabinet officials and senior advisers (e.g., acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton) from testifying as part of his all-out effort to obstruct the investigation.

Trump’s brazenness should not be surprising. He sees no separation between his personal, partisan interests and interests of the United States. He is willing, eager even, to enlist help of corrupt actors, thereby heightening the corruption problem he claims to be oh so very concerned about rooting out.

Republicans’ refusal to recognize the ongoing threat to national security posed by this president is among their most grievous and unpardonable sins. They are no more loyal to the United States than Trump is, who we now know cannot refrain from further endangering national security even as he faces impeachment. “Lock her up!” turns out to be the best example of Trump’s predilection for projection.

Democratic impeachment investigators release their report on alleged wrongdoing by Trump. The investigation “uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election,” it reads.

The report breaks some news by sharing call records that could more directly link Trump to the people advocating for political quid pro quos with Ukraine.

As the political pressure campaign on Ukraine was going on, Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, made more than a dozen calls to the White House, and to a mysterious number listed as “-1” that could be Trump’s personal cell. We don’t know what was said on the calls. But besides being a potential spying bonanza for Russians, the calls make it more difficult for Trump to argue he had nothing to do with Giuliani’s efforts to pressure Ukraine in exchange for an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president.

WEDNESDAY

The House panel tasked with writing up articles of impeachment, the Judiciary Committee, holds its first hearing, which is a constitutional debate about what merits impeachment. Three law scholars picked by Democrats argue that what Trump is accused of is the definition of impeachable, while the scholar picked by Republicans (who said he did not vote for Trump) cautions that Democrats are moving too fast and could have a stronger case if they waited for more evidence.

“Everything I know about our Constitution and its values, and my review of the evidentiary record, tells me that when President Trump invited, indeed, demanded foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart of what makes this country to which we pledge allegiance,” says Stanford Law professor Pamela Karlan.

“If we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy. We live in a monarchy, or we live under a dictatorship,” says Harvard law professor Noah Feldman.

It’s official: The House is moving from an impeachment inquiry into actual impeachment of Trump. “I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment,” Pelosi says in an address to the nation.

As an impeachment vote looms in the House, there is little sign of defections among Republicans. The top Republican on the impeachment committee, Rep. Douglas A.

More than 500 legal scholars from law schools across the country sign a letter saying Trump engaged in “impeachable conduct.” Meanwhile, some Republican committee chairmen said they are investigating whether Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, with an intent to prove Trump’s conspiracy theory was rooted in some fact. The federal government’s entire intelligence apparatus has said it was Russia, not Ukraine, that boldly tried to influence the 2016 election.

Democratic senators running for president start making contingency plans for how they’ll campaign for Iowa’s crucial Feb. 3 caucus when they will likely be stuck in Washington for most of January for the Senate’s impeachment trial.

“The impeachment inquiry is completely baseless,” White House counsel Pat Cipollone writes to Democrats in a letter Friday, the deadline Democrats gave him to decide whether Trump’s lawyers will participate in any more hearings.

So we guess that’s a “no” on participating in Monday’s hearing.

Trump tried an argument along those lines on Twitter on Wednesday.

“When I said, in my phone call to the President of Ukraine, ‘I would like you to do US a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,’ ” he said. “With the word ‘us’ I am referring to the United States, our Country. I then went on to say that ‘I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people.....’ ”

This fits in with the line of defense we heard from Republicans repeatedly during the impeachment inquiry’s public hearings. Trump was simply asking that Ukraine investigate corruption and possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election. That latter claim itself requires defending, since there’s no good evidence that Ukraine tried to interfere in the election in the first place.

But those defenses have another flaw, as surely as Trump’s Twitter defense does: It’s not what Trump asked for.

AD

Here’s what Trump asked of Zelensky, according to the rough transcript released by the White House itself.

On “corruption”: “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

On “interference”: “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.”

AD

It would have been remarkably simple, really, for Trump to have simply asked Zelensky to investigate corruption, perhaps focusing specifically on Biden. He didn’t even need to do that, really. Sondland had already informed Ukrainian officials during a meeting at the White House that a meeting between both presidents would be predicated on “investigations into the 2016 elections, the Bidens, and Burisma,” according to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman who, as a member of the National Security Council, was present for the meeting. (Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company for which Joe Biden’s son Hunter worked and which is at the center of the unfounded theory involving the Bidens.)

AD

Zelensky mentioned that his staff had already spoken to Trump’s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been advocating publicly for investigations into the Bidens. But despite all that, Trump instead asked only about Biden.

As for the “interference” request, what Trump asked is light-years from what his defenders claim. Trump was focused on a conspiracy theory in which the determination that Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016 was erroneous and driven by ties to a Ukrainian oligarch — ties that routed from a firm that did initial analysis (CrowdStrike) through one of its founders to an organization he’s associated with to one of that organization’s founders.

AD

Never mind that the U.S. government itself independently determined that Russia was culpable and that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s team obtained an indictment against a dozen Russians on the strength of other evidence. Trump, furious about the investigation into Russian interference and looking for opportunities to undermine it, hoped Ukraine could at least cast some doubt, however small, on its origins.

AD

This has all been obvious for more than two months. What the information collected during the impeachment inquiry reveals, though, is that there isn’t much evidence that Trump himself ever made requests that were any broader than the ones he made directly to Zelensky. In other words, while others in the administration spoke in broader terms about what Trump wanted, it’s not clear that Trump ever framed his concerns that way. And if he didn’t, the effort to rationalize his behavior as serving the collective “US” collapses.

Several individuals who gave testimony during the impeachment inquiry described what they had heard from Trump. So, too, did Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who had been told by Sondland in late August that aid was being held to pressure Ukraine to launch the investigations.

AD

Johnson broached the issue with Trump in a call on Aug. 31, as the senator prepared to travel to Ukraine to meet Zelensky. He asked Trump whether he could tell Zelensky that the aid, blocked since early July, was being released. Trump said no while denying that Sondland’s link of aid to the investigations was accurate. (By this point, according to New York Times reporting, Trump already knew about the whistleblower complaint.)

AD

Nonetheless, Johnson did say that Trump raised a concern related to what he’d asked Zelensky.

“What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016?” Trump said, according to what Johnson told reporters. “What was the truth about that?”

AD

The vagueness (and the uncertainty whether this was a quote or a paraphrase of the president) makes it hard to evaluate what Trump was concerned about. It is also not exculpatory, however, with Johnson failing to say that Trump specifically asked about Ukrainian interference.

We get slightly closer to the Trump defenders’ claim in a conversation Sondland had with Trump shortly before the aid was released (a change that followed the announcement by House Democrats that they were investigating why it had been stopped).

“I just want Zelensky to do the right thing,” Sondland said he was told by Trump, “to do what he ran on — or words to that effect.”

AD

AD

The suggestion is that Trump was worried about corruption, since that’s what Zelensky campaigned on, but the “words to that effect” does diminish how much weight this should be given.

At the time, Sondland told Tim Morrison of the National Security Council about his call, telling Morrison that Trump insisted Zelensky “go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of ‘Biden and 2016 election interference,' "" as acting Ukraine ambassador William B. Taylor Jr. later testified, having heard about the call from Morrison. (Sondland testified that he had no reason to dispute this.)

By that point, Sondland and others acting on Trump’s behalf were using “Burisma” and “election interference” or “2016” as equivalent to what Trump had specifically asked Zelensky. When Sondland and Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker were working with a Zelensky aide on a statement that would publicly announce the investigations, the language they insisted be added was the bold part below, which falls precisely along those lines:

AD

AD

“We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 US elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.”

When Morrison spoke with that same Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak, following Yermak’s meeting with Giuliani in Madrid, he was told that “the statement would include specific mention of Burisma and 2016.” Yermak later tried to get the White House meeting confirmed before releasing the statement, which, he assured Volker and Sondland, would include “among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.”

It’s not clear, then, if Trump told people such as Sondland that he wanted an investigation into election interference (for example) or into Ukraine and the DNC server, which his experienced aides then summarized as “election interference.”

AD

We do know what Trump asked Zelensky. And we know what Trump said he wanted during an interview with Fox News last month. Trump was talking about his theory that he had been unfairly targeted in the Russia probe and then easily slid into his theory about the server and CrowdStrike.

“That’s a big part of this whole thing,” Trump said of this theory which, again, is utterly baseless.

“Well, that’s what the word is,” he continued, after one of the show’s hosts questioned the accuracy of the assertion. “And that’s what I asked actually in my phone call, you know. I mean, I asked that very point blank because we’re looking for corruption. There’s tremendous corruption we’re looking for. Why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there’s this kind of corruption?”

With that, Trump circled back to the original point: His focus was corruption — though, again, that’s not what he asked Zelensky about.

One other individual backs up Trump’s claim that his real focus was corruption.

“I’ve been in the office a couple times with him, talking about this,” acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said at a news conference in October. “And he said, ‘Look, Mick, this is a corrupt place.’ … ‘I don’t want to send them a bunch of money and have them waste it, have them spend it, have them use it to line their own pockets.’ ” The halt was specifically to consider this question of corruption, Mulvaney claimed, though we’ve since learned that the Department of Defense had completed its own review of Ukraine’s progress on corruption and approved the aid to move forward months before Trump stopped it.

“So that was — those were the driving factors,” Mulvaney continued at that October news conference. “Did he also mention to me in pass[ing] the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.”

It was an absolute obliteration of the first claim we raised at the outset of this article, that aid wasn’t withheld to get the desired investigations and a secondhand defense, at best, of the other claim, that Trump’s real focus was on benefiting the country."

ALLENDALE, S, C. — The Democrats in South Carolina's bluest county had laid out the welcome mat for Pete Buttigieg: a crowded headquarters, a soul food buffet, and praise for being the first 2020 Democrat to visit.

The next thing the South Bend, Ind., mayor got was skepticism.

“I hear a lot about how you don't have support from African Americans,” said Willa Jennings, the county Democratic chair. She turned to Sharon McBride, a black member of South Bend's city council who'd come to campaign with Buttigieg. “Could you tell us some of the things that Mayor Pete has done in South Bend to benefit the citizens in your city?”

It wasn't comfortable. It wasn't supposed to be. Buttigieg, who has surged in polls of Iowa and New Hampshire thanks to support from college-educated white voters, had put together a sort of Southern humility tour. A candidate breaking crowd-count records in small, white towns was holding small meet-and-greets in nonwhite ones.

“I know a lot of African American voters have felt not only kicked around by the Republican Party, but sometimes taken for granted by the Democratic Party that knows how to come to church just before an election but doesn't always come back and engage the community when it's most needed,” he explained. “I know that as somebody who's new on the scene, I've got to earn that trust.”

Sometimes he linked his life as a gay man and son of an immigrant to the experience of nonwhite voters. Sometimes, more self-effacingly, he admitted what he didn't know. In Allendale, where McBride called it a “myth” that Buttigieg had problems with black voters back home, Buttigieg said he was working to connect his own experience to theirs, if he only got the time.

“It's so important to me to earn the support of black voters,” Buttigieg said. “Now, if you were the last poll that came out, I think there were two candidates who had double-digit support among black voters. All the rest of us were in [single digits]. But I don't think that's permanent.”

That was a reference to a national Quinnipiac poll, which had shown Buttigieg surging to 23 percent with white voters, a lead, while winning just 4 percent of black voters. No other candidate polling in double digits overall had such a large racial support gap. His weakness with nonwhite voters has become a punchline from “Saturday Night Live” (“My supporters are a diverse coalition from young to old, gay to straight, white to eggshell”) to the Onion (“Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote”). And racial justice activists had piled on, with a protest breaking out at a pro-Buttigieg event in South Bend, and four immigrant rights groups demanding that he give back any donations from McKinsey employees after revelations about the consulting firm's work on deportation.

Buttigieg's monochrome appeal has made the campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden (the two candidates with double-digit support from black voters in that Quinnipiac poll) happier about his rise in Iowa. In their view, the mayor could kneecap Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has made some inroads with black and Latino voters and take over her “lane” with well-educated white voters, only to get pushed out in Nevada and South Carolina. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, one of the state's most prominent black politicians — the kind of pol, an ambitious mayor of a mid-sized city, who has gotten behind the mayor in other states — endorsed Mike Bloomberg days before Buttigieg's latest trip began. Even this week, as Buttigieg went on the air with a $2 million ad buy, supporters of Biden and Sanders dismissed his chances.

“He's a nonstarter; he's not going to scratch,” said Dick Harpootlian, a state senator and Biden supporter. “This is a guy who's been the mayor of a town not even as big as Columbia, who's got tremendous issues with race relations, who's abandoned his city to run for president. He's not got any sort of civil rights record that would engage African American voters. He's too young and too white.”

The mayor's low-key Southern tour put all of his troubles on display, as well as the different ways he has tried to tackle them — sometimes admitting his blind spots, sometimes sounding too eager to link his relatively privileged life to black and brown struggles.

On Sunday, after attending a service at the Rev. William Barber's church in North Carolina, Buttigieg admitted that he “worked for years under the illusion that our schools in my city were integrated because they had to be, because of a court order.” On Tuesday, at a roundtable with Latino voters, he mentioned that his own father came to America in the 1970s under the “lawful immigration process.” But the experience of a first-generation Maltese American didn't really resonate in the room.

“Part of the bigger issue that is affecting our communities is really that fear in trusting someone again, right?” said Fernando Soto, a DACA recipient and immigrant rights activist from Charleston. (He'd attended a previous meet-and-greet with Biden.) “The Latino community is very, very loyal. But we've been burned many times. And with the Obama administration, I would say that we were tokenized in order for that election to be won.”

Soto wanted Buttigieg to promise an immigration solution in his first term, which Buttigieg did before returning to his overall theory of politics. “If this White House really wanted to resolve immigration issues, they could do it; there's a bipartisan consensus, and then they could claim credit for the achievement,” Buttigieg said. “But they've made a decision not to. And I think that shows that the division is more useful to them than the issue. For my White House, the reverse would be true. We are depending on a more unified country.”

Without Biden's long record in the state, or Sanders's civil rights history, or Warren's detailed critique of discrimination, Buttigieg was often asking voters to see his sincerity. In Allendale and at the Latino forum in Okatie, voters most impressed by Buttigieg cited his military service as evidence that he understood nonwhite voters.

“When you sign up you meet people from all kinds of different backgrounds,” said Gustavo Gomez, 47, a Marine veteran, who’d asked Buttigieg about Puerto Rican representation in Congress. (Buttigieg favored changing that “sooner rather than later,” which Gomez appreciated.) “That helps you govern better.”

On Monday afternoon, Buttigieg took a tour of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, solemnly visiting a memorial to students killed in 1968 when protesting a segregated bowling alley, then bowling a round at the alley on campus — eight pins, then a strike. Two dozen students stopped by for free pizza and conversations, appreciating that Buttigieg would spend the time with them.

“He just did an endorsement video for my Instagram,” said Kayla Hasty, 21, who was running in a contest to pick the top 10 “kings and queens” of historically black colleges and universities. “You don't see many politicians doing that.” She remained undecided.

Charles C. Patton, Hasty's running mate, was in some ways less impressed. Buttigieg was not connecting with black voters, he said, when he linked his own life to the civil rights struggle. As a queer man, Patton found Buttigieg most compelling when he talked about LGBTQ rights, a subject he clearly knew inside out.

“I was happy to hear that he knows what's going on in our community, with black trans women, with LGBTQ youth, with homelessness,” said Patton. “That mattered to me. I like him. He's cool. I love his policies, but sometimes people don't have real awareness of how it affects people, and he has that.”

It was as strong a connection as Buttigieg had all day. After their conversation, Patton was considering a vote for Buttigieg — or Biden, or Warren.

DEBATE SEASON

There are just seven days left for Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to make the sixth Democratic debate. It’s not likely to happen.

To climb onto the Los Angeles debate stage, Booker would need to hit 4 percent in four polls, or 6 percent in two polls of the early-voting states. There may not be enough polls in the field right now, even if Booker were experiencing a dramatic surge in support. Which he isn’t.

That was the backdrop for Booker's Thursday morning speech in Iowa, a late edition to his schedule in the wake of Sen. Kamala D. Harris's exit from the presidential race, where he argued outright that nervous donors and shortsighted debate rules were bleaching the primary before voters got to pick their candidate.

“People in Iowa, people in New Hampshire, people in Nevada, people in South Carolina should determine this race. Not how much [money] is being poured in,” Booker said. “This isn't about an individual candidate, as much as I am hurt, my family members hurt, as much as people are frustrated about Kamala’s story. Kamala was never in it for herself. She knew this was a bigger story. This is not about one candidate. It is about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump.”

Booker returned again and again to Harris, whose campaign had collapsed in Iowa, but who had been drawing bigger crowds, more endorsements, and more volunteers than the wealthy candidates who'd plunged into the race.

“She had this campaign that spoke to the aspirations of our country,” Booker said. “Here is a black woman, an Asian woman who broke barriers at every point of her campaign, and won in our largest state: 40-plus million people. She's lived her whole life dedicated to public service. I get to sit with her in the Judiciary Committee, I see who she is and I just want to say from my heart, it is a problem when an immensely qualified, widely supported, truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party, a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters, didn't have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa.”

It was a dramatic moment for Booker, who had been making this case again and again in the hours since Harris's campaign ended. Harris had qualified for the December debate, making her an inconvenient martyr for this cause. But her exit gave new urgency to an argument former HUD secretary Julián Castro had been making when he missed the November debate: The party was silencing several credible nonwhite candidates.

That argument has helped Castro, who has no path back to the stage under current rules, raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, keeping his low-overhead campaign afloat. It has found a guilty conscience in Tom Steyer, the billionaire whose omnipresent TV ads have helped him qualify for the debates.

“I’m calling on the DNC to open up the debate requirements for January so that more candidates can participate,” Steyer said in a statement. “In order to defeat Donald Trump, Democrats need to engage voters from every part of the country, and that means making sure voters hear from a diverse group of candidates before they select our nominee.”

Steyer was pushing on an open door; DNC Chairman Tom Perez told The Post last month that the DNC would revisit its debate rules in January. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said that the party had created “the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires,” and that Democrats were “proud of this historic and diverse field,” as showcased in most of the debates so far.

“While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process,” Hinojosa said. “Nobody who has failed to reach 4 percent at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that. In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We’ve never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Joe Biden, “Laughed At.” A pool camera covering a Buckingham Palace reception for NATO members captured Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau making fun of President Trump. Within 24 hours, Biden's campaign put it into an ad that focuses on the theme of his recent campaign spots: that Trump is embarrassing the country and the former vice president could restore its image. Three of Biden's last four commercials hit the same notes (and even the same imagery, of Biden walking alongside Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel), but this one went viral quickly, helped by audio clips of TV hosts discussing how little respect Trump commanded.

Elizabeth Warren, “Wealth Tax.” The senator from Massachusetts has spent less on TV than anyone else polling in double digits, and her campaign plunked down less than $1,000 to run this spot, in conjunction with her Bloomberg TV interview. It's her second time with this gimmick; previously, she bought time on CNBC to highlight criticism of the wealth tax from some of the network's wealthy guests.

Tom Steyer, “Save the World, Do It Together.” The billionaire candidate's march through early-state TV screens continues with a first: a subtle argument with another candidate. In the spot, Steyer asks a rhetorical question: “How are we going to pull this country together?” He answers it by talking about climate change. “We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world and do it together. You think that’d pull America together? I do.” It's a response to the message that has done well for Buttigieg recently, that the post-Trump president's first job will be reuniting Americans, something he doesn't tie to a particular issue.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (UC Berkeley, 1,694 California voters)

Bernie Sanders: 24% ( 5)

Elizabeth Warren: 22% (-7)

Joe Biden: 14% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg: 12% ( 6)

Kamala Harris: 7% (-1)

Andrew Yang: 3% ( 1)

Amy Klobuchar: 3% ( 1)

Mike Bloomberg: 2% ( 2)

This may be the final poll to offer Kamala Harris's name for voters, and a sub-question found that 61 percent of California Democrats thought she should leave the race. It's also Sanders's first good poll in the state for some time, though Harris's departure ameliorates the bad news for Warren: She was the most popular second choice for voters who had been sticking with the race's second-highest-profile female candidate. And she's in a better position than Biden, who trails Sanders with Latino voters and gets pummeled with young voters: By a landslide, voters under 30 stick with Sanders. Biden's strength with nonwhite Democrats, the basis of his lead in Southern primaries, is harder to find in delegate-rich California.

IN THE STATES

Florida. Andrew Gillum, last year's unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor, will become the chairman of iVote's board, following a year of voting rights advocacy and voter registration campaigns in his home state.

Georgia. Five-term Rep. Tom Graves will retire next year, a surprise for Republicans who saw a long future for their 49-year-old colleague. Graves's 14th District, which covered northwest Georgia, is safely Republican and backed the president by 53 points in 2016.

Washington. Four-term Rep. Denny Heck is leaving his relatively safe Democratic seat around Tacoma, explaining in a letter that the Republican response to the Trump presidency had wearied him: “Will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.” Trump lost Heck's 10th Congressional District by 13 points, making it a reach for Republicans in a state Democrats expect to easily win.

2020

Joe Biden. He got one of the biggest endorsements in the Democratic Party on Thursday, with former secretary of state and 2004 presidential nominee John Kerry getting behind his campaign. Kerry, who's three years younger than Biden, had been fitfully discussed as a 2020 candidate but made no moves toward a run. He'll campaign with the former vice president this weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Pete Buttigieg. He won endorsements from three lower-profile members of the Obama team: the president's personal aide Reggie Love, former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Austan Goolsbee, and former White House Office of Health Reform communications director Linda Douglass.

Bernie Sanders. He picked up the support of the Iowa CCI Action Fund, a liberal group in the state that had supported him in 2016 and worked with him in his campaigns.

Mike Bloomberg. In Aurora, Colo., the site of a 2013 mass shooting, he proposed a new gun control system that would include not just background checks but federal licensing, a bugaboo of gun rights activists.

Cory Booker. United We Win, the new super PAC that had bought an ad contrasting Booker with Buttigieg, announced $500,000 in new spending designed to help him enter the December debate. One example: a bus ad showing Booker next to Bloomberg and Steyer, with the legend, “We need diversity, not more billionaires.”

MEET A PAC

THE PAC: 1820 PAC

PARTY: Republican

FOCUS: Providing air cover for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, running ads that pitch her as a moderate who the Senate could not afford to lose.

BUDGET: It has paid for $400,000 of ads so far, and as of summer, it had raised $776,000 from wealthy donors, most of it from Blackstone Group chief executive Stephen Schwartzman.

PLAN: The group's first ad emphasizes ways in which Collins has broke with Republicans and the Trump administration. “When the big drug companies were gouging patients, Susan took them on and wrote a law to lower drug prices,” a narrator says. “When extremists in both parties shut down the government, Susan Collins led the bipartisan effort to end the stalemate.”

EFFECTIVENESS: It's on brand for Collins, whose campaign, like others that have expected super PACs to help them, had already uploaded b-roll footage for curious ad-makers. (Campaigns cannot coordinate with super PACs, but nothing prevents them releasing a few soundless clips of candidates meeting voters in factories.)

WHAT I'M WATCHING

NARAL's big 2020 bet. The abortion rights group is planning its biggest-ever political investment next year, spending $34.7 million to turn out 3.6 million voters in eight states: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina.

“We think abortion is central to the election, and it should be central,” said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. “It’s an issue Democrats can and do win on. The energy of the base on this is off the charts, because of the abortion bans we’ve seen in the states.”

NARAL's target states include a few of the Democrats' must-wins in the electoral college and a few the group sees as crucial for Senate math: Georgia and Iowa. (There are Senate races in all eight states, and Michigan and Minnesota have Democratic incumbents.)

The focus of the campaign, a combination of ads and organizing, will be “reminding people of what their senator has done and what Trump has led,” said Hogue. That included the “extraordinary overreach of judges,” the appointment of antiabortion judges who most of the targeted senators voted for (Collins was an occasional exception), and the passage or introduction of “dangerous medically inaccurate legislation” in the states.

That messaging, Hogue said, would activate three kinds of voters: the Democrats' base, lower-propensity voters who lean toward Democrats (and sat out some recent elections), and “soft partisan” women who've voted Republican before but bolted the party over abortion rights. Virginia, where Republicans tried and failed to turn legislation to loosen abortion restrictions into an election issue this year, was the proof of concept.

Hogue, who helped amend the Democrats' 2016 platform to make it more supportive of abortion rights, said that NARAL had advantages that didn't exist then.

“We were warning people that Trump said women should be punished for abortion, and that he’d appoint only pro-life judges,” Hogue said. “But there was a combination of people saying, 'Oh, he only says that to be elected,' and 'Oh, and that could never happen here.'

“House Democrats have wasted enough of America’s time with this charade. You should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings,” Cipollone wrote on Friday to the Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “Adopting articles of impeachment would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats, and would constitute the most unjust, highly partisan, and unconstitutional attempt at impeachment in our Nation's history.”

The White House declined to comment on the record about whether Cipollone’s letter meant Trump was rejecting the invitation to participate in the House process.

But a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s position, said the White House sees no reason to participate because the process is “unfair.”

AD

AD

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) “has already announced the predetermined result,” the official said. “They will not give us the ability to call any witnesses.”

Nadler criticized Cipollone’s response.

“We gave President Trump a fair opportunity to question witnesses and present his own to address the overwhelming evidence before us,” he said in a statement. “After listening to him complain about the impeachment process, we had hoped that he might accept our invitation.”

Nadler had given Trump a 5 p.m. Friday deadline for alerting the committee on whether he or his aides wanted to take part in upcoming impeachment events. The tone of the response came as little surprise. Throughout the impeachment proceedings, the White House has barred witnesses from testifying and declined to provide documents demanded by Democrats, and it did not send lawyers to the Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment hearing on Wednesday.

Instead, the White House is largely looking to the Republican-controlled Senate to wage a full defense of Trump, who is accused of abusing the powers of the presidency when he pressured Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter as well as an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Both Ukrainian inquiries could benefit Trump politically, and the request came at a time when Ukraine’s new president was seeking the delivery of U.S. aid to counter Russian military aggression and also was pursuing a White House meeting with Trump to show Moscow that the United States stood with his country.

Pelosi has directed key committees to begin writing the articles, which could include an array of impeachable offenses such as bribery and obstruction of Congress. Members of the Judiciary Committee are to meet this weekend to discuss what those articles would entail. Democrats remain locked in an internal debate over expanding them to cover Trump’s behavior as outlined by Robert S. Mueller III’s special counsel report on his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

Though she has yet to offer a firm timeline, Pelosi left little doubt that her chamber was headed toward an impeachment vote in as little as two weeks. That would probably put the start of a Senate trial in January. The Republican-controlled chamber, where two-thirds of its members would have to vote to remove the president from office, is expected to acquit Trump.

A deputy White House press secretary said earlier Friday that Trump “welcomes” a Senate trial and reiterated that the president wants “serious witnesses” to appear, including the anonymous whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and the Bidens. What witnesses ultimately come forward in the Senate will depend largely on the senators themselves, because those 100 members will determine how, procedurally, an impeachment trial is structured.

“If it goes there, he wants a trial,” the deputy press secretary, Hogan Gidley, said on Fox News. “If they’re going to do this, if the Democrats want this fight, it’s something the president is willing to have.”

Cipollone echoed that sentiment in his letter to Nadler.

AD

“Whatever course you choose, as the President has recently stated: ‘if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business,’ ” he wrote.

AD

Democrats pushed back against the White House’s arguments for not taking part in the House process, arguing that the White House’s reasons continue to change.

“The White House said they wanted open hearings, not closed, and then they didn’t want those either,” Schiff tweeted Friday. “Then they said they wanted to participate in the proceedings, and now they say they don’t. All they really want is to hide the President’s serious misconduct.”

AD

Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee on Friday sent Nadler a list of witnesses they would like to appear before the panel. It mostly echoed people Trump has mentioned but also had additional names, including Alexandra Chalupa, who was hired as a consultant to the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign to help mobilize ethnic-minority communities, and Devon Archer, a business partner of Hunter Biden’s.

AD

The White House’s latest criticisms of the impeachment process came as new questions began to surface about the activities of Trump personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who returned to Ukraine this week to meet with people accused of spreading discredited theories about corruption and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

He met the pro-Russian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, who claimed to have information about misspent American funds and who called for a joint U.S.-Ukraine investigation into his corruption allegations. Derkach recently aired unfounded corruption claims against Hunter Biden related to the time Hunter Biden spent on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

AD

Giuliani was accompanied by a crew from the pro-Trump news network One America News, which boasted it had debunked the impeachment allegations against Trump in its reporting of the trip. In a tweet, Giuliani claimed that Trump will ask that the claims made by the people he met in Ukraine be investigated.

AD

Even Republicans who have staunchly stood by Trump largely declined to defend Giuliani’s latest journey to the eastern European nation that has become the focal point of the impeachment proceedings.

“I don’t know everything he’s doing, who he’s meeting with, what the conversations are,” said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.). “I would like to have more information to give you a better response.”



AD

Gidley, the deputy White House press secretary, also declined to say whether Trump knew what Giuliani was doing abroad, or whether the president was comfortable with his lawyer’s latest activities.

“I haven’t spoken with him about that directly,” Gidley told reporters at the White House. “But obviously Rudy Giuliani can speak for himself; he’s the president’s personal attorney.”

But Giuliani’s trip also came as Republican allies of Trump in the Senate continued to intensify their focus on Ukraine, particularly on the unfounded theory that Kyiv sought to hurt Trump during his 2016 campaign.

AD

Three Senate committee chairmen announced Friday that they are seeking records and transcribed interviews from two people who, they claim, could bolster a notion advanced by Trump that “elements of the Ukrainian government were actively working to undermine” his prospects against Democrat Hillary Clinton.

“Contrary to the popular narrative in the ‘main stream media’ that Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election has been debunked, or ‘no evidence exists,’ there are many unanswered questions that have festered for years,” Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said in a statement.

Also involved in the push to obtain the documents are Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) fired back at the Republicans, warning that their efforts only risked damaging national security.

“When Vladimir Putin says stoop, Senate Republicans are asking: ‘How low?’ ” Schumer said Friday. “Putin and his intelligence services’ disinformation campaign team in Moscow couldn’t have cooked up a more useful tool for spreading conjured and baseless conspiracy theories than the one Chairmen Graham, Grassley and Johnson announced today.”"

In 1969, a coastal California city about 90 miles northwest of Los Angeles was beset by one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history.

A blowout on a Unocal rig cracked the sea floor and uncorked 3 million barrels of oil off the Santa Barbara shoreline.

The spill spurred the first celebration of Earth Day the following year. The city had helped give birth to the modern environmental movement.

But now Santa Barbara, popular today with tourists for its breezy beaches and Mediterranean flair, is reeling from another crisis exacerbated by the oil business: extreme climate change.

The coastal region that runs south from Santa Barbara through Los Angeles to the Mexican border is warming at double the rate of the continental United States, according to the latest installment in a Washington Post series on global hot spots that have warmed more than 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels around the globe.

Since 1895, the average temperature in Santa Barbara County has gone up by 2.3 degrees Celsius. Neighboring Ventura County has warmed up by 2.6 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, making it the fastest-warming county in the Lower 48 states.

The result, as The Post’s Scott Wilson reports, is an eroding bluffside beachfront that has led to the condemnation of apartment buildings, wildfires that have forced thousands to evacuate and heat waves that have scorched orchards and killed livestock.

In a sign of how hard it is for communities of any political stripe to confront the challenge, many residents of even this liberal city are resisting efforts to reduce its own contributions to the changing climate around them.

The birthplace of the modern environmental movement is rich in oil. And the petroleum industry still has clout here.

""In 2014, it spent big to defeat a county referendum that would have banned 'high-intensive' drilling operations such as fracking and steam injection,"" Wilson writes. ""And county officials are actively considering a proposal to allow a major drilling expansion in the north, a move environmentalists say would directly contradict their climate goals.""

But it's automobiles that are the biggest contributor to Santa Barbara County’s greenhouse gas emissions. So local environmentalists have also campaigned to replace free public parking downtown with housing to curb traffic.

But that lobbying effort has yet to move city officials. Another industry interest — not Big Oil, but downtown retailers and restaurants — worry fewer parking spots for their patrons will hurt their bottom lines.

“Parking is the third rail of Santa Barbara politics,” Michael Chiacos, a Santa Barbara native with the nonprofit group Community Environmental Council, told Wilson.

That local political fight is part of a broader reckoning within California when it comes to cars and climate change.

Leaders of the car-crazy state desperately want to cut emissions from the transportation sector. So they brokered a deal with the Obama administration and car companies to set tighter fuel-efficiency standards on cars and trucks through 2025.

But the Trump administration upended that deal and revoked California’s long-standing authority to set its own tailpipe pollution standards. Now California and 22 other states have sued to block the move.

Deja vu: “The rally will be led by the same coalition that organized a September event in which protesters set up blockades at 15 downtown intersections throughout the morning and chained themselves to the hull of a boat blocks from the White House — ultimately culminating in 32 arrests,” The Post’s Marissa J.

— EPA watchdog says agency didn’t conduct analyses for glider truck rule: The Environmental Protection Agency’s internal watchdog says the agency did not conduct necessary analyses in the effort to repeal Obama-era emissions standards for glider trucks. According to the agency inspector general’s report, then-EPA chief Scott Pruitt “directed that the Glider Repeal Rule be promulgated as quickly as possible.” It added that the “lack of analyses caused the public to not be informed of the proposed rule’s benefits, costs, potential alternatives and impacts on children’s health during the public comment period.” Gliders use older engines that emit more soot and contaminants compared to newer trucks.

The status of the proposal: “The agency’s proposal to repeal the glider kit requirements has sat dormant for more than two years now. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s first act as head of the agency was to walk back a move from Pruitt to temporarily relieve glider-kit makers from the requirements,” the Washington Examiner reports. “ … It isn’t clear whether the EPA would still pursue a full repeal.”

And I believe very deeply that Joe Biden’s character, his ability to persevere, his decency and the experiences that he brings to the table are critical to the moment,” Kerry told The Post in an interview.

What Biden says : The former vice president told reporters in Iowa that he “called Kerry a good friend who, like himself, had important relationships with world leaders and with whom he had worked closely with on climate change issues,” the Boston Globe reports. Kerry also recently launched a star-studded new climate coalition.

— A new policy to protect Golden State homeowners in fire-prone regions: A new California policy prohibits insurance companies from canceling people’s policies in fire-prone parts of the state. The policy “imposes a one-year moratorium, preventing insurers from dropping customers in or alongside ZIP codes struck by recent wildfires. The moratorium covers at least 800,000 homes around the state,” the New York Times reports. “The state has also asked insurers to voluntarily stop dropping customers anywhere in California because of fire risk for one year.” Insurers in the state are facing a particularly difficult task preparing for the risks associated with accelerating climate change.

Now those behind the plan — which has seen support increase fivefold since the leaders first sent a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission last month — have released a set of guidelines for how such a public utility would run. “With these principles, we’ve presented a framework for a viable customer-owned PG&E that will be transparent, accountable, and equitable,” Liccardo said in a statement.

The details: The seven “operating principles” includes guidelines for transparency, ensures no regions are cut from PG&E’s current service area and preserves “existing PG&E labor contracts and preserve the existing skilled workforce.”

She’s a relatively fresh face (in contrast to Biden), has experience in national security (sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee) and superior media skills. Moreover, she was friends with Biden’s deceased son Beau, a fellow state attorney general. One cannot help but think picking her as a running mate would strike a deep emotional cord with Biden.

Harris is one of those potential VP contenders who would help virtually any candidate — and not simply because the serious contenders who remain are all white and she is an African American woman. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could use someone older, with inside-the-Beltway experience and a record on civil rights that would reassure many nonwhite voters. If she is on the ticket with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), she provides some appeal for progressives; on a ticket with the super-progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), she becomes the more moderate vice president, someone with appeal outside the niche of white, New England progressives.

In one sense, Harris’s perceived fuzziness on issues during her own campaign becomes a plus as a vice president who can easily adopt the positions of the top of the ticket. Her own policy positions are not set in stone and are therefore not likely to clash with a running mate.

Sure, Harris’s campaign failed, but few would argue that she lacked political skills, charisma, smarts and media prowess. As a vice presidential nominee, she would not be running the campaign; she would be on one that successfully navigated through a crowded field.

There is one more interesting scenario in which she may play a significant role. This cycle really is the one in which there is a reasonable chance no candidate will get a majority in the primaries, setting up a convention fight. Who wouldn’t want to have on his or her side someone part of the largest delegation (California), someone who racked up endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus and someone who can deliver a boffo political speech in a big arena?

There's little chance that impeachment will remove President Trump from office. But one Wall Street strategist notes that it could complicate his reelection path.

Economic forecasters have predicted that Trump should cruise to a second term next year given the strength of the economy. But a new analysis from JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that the onslaught of coverage of impeachment and Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals is drowning out the positive economic news he needs to win.

The dynamic highlights the challenge facing the White House as it pursues a split-screen strategy depicting Trump as focused on his agenda while congressional Democrats press ahead with impeachment.

Michael Cembalest, JPMorgan Asset Management's chairman of market and investment strategy, lays out the quandary facing Trump in a pair of charts. First, Cembalest crunched a raft of data to conclude Trump is heading into the 2020 campaign with the strongest economic tail winds going back to 1896.

The measures blended more than a century of readings on consumer price inflation, the jobless rate, the change in that rate, per capita economic growth, how that growth compares to that of other leading economies, stock market returns, and home price appreciation, among others:

But viewers tuning into primetime CNN and MSNBC from 8 to 10 p.m. over a year-long period ending in September saw barely a blip about positive economic developments. Instead, the Mueller investigation and Russian interference in the 2016 election overwhelmingly dominated those airwaves, followed by coverage of Trump’s personal conduct in office, then immigration issues, then administration corruption:

Trump critics will contend the president has earned that coverage through his behavior, while he merely inherited an economic expansion that has mostly continued apace. Cembalest mostly agrees: “Trump deserves the coverage he’s getting from those news outlets,” he tells me.

But he wrote the note to illustrate something he observed in his own home: His wife, a devoted MSNBC watcher, hears a version of the news that bears little resemblance to what he sees all day studying market and economic indicators. The divide both fuels and is fueled by a broader Balkanization of the electorate that suggests the traditional relationship between the economy's performance and the president’s political fortunes may be breaking down.

By matching historical economic data to presidential election outcomes, economists at Moody’s Analytics, Oxford Economics and Trend Macrolytics have all projected Trump will secure reelection more easily than his first win, barring a serious economic downturn. But the more relevant point of comparison may be 2018. An analysis Cembalest conducted after the election found that measured against the strength of the economy, Republicans suffered the worst midterm losses by a president’s party in at least a century.

The finding could reframe Trump’s political incentives in waging his trade war. Conventional wisdom has held the president keeps up the fight at his own peril, since it remains arguably the greatest menace to continued economic growth.

But if he can galvanize his base by stoking confrontation with the Chinese — and that outweighs whatever economic costs it brings — it may be in Trump’s interest to keep putting off a deal. “I think that’s true up to a point,” Cembalest says, arguing if the president goes forward with December 15 tariffs heavily targeting consumer goods, ""I think he’d lose them, because the global recession that could result would offset the benefits from the base. He has to figure out how to conduct the trade war” with lower stakes.

Some support for the theory comes from across the Atlantic. “Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, both of Bocconi University in Milan, study election results in 15 European countries,” per The Economist. “They find that areas facing greater competition from Chinese imports were more likely to vote for nationalist parties.”

More from that piece, titled ""Does the economy affect elections anymore?"": “The old straightforward relationship between the economic cycle and elections could yet return. But the implication of the new research is that support for populism is a deeper-rooted feature of Western economies… Voters care less than they used to about the economy's immediate impact on their wallets. But they care more than ever about how the economy shapes their identity--their sense of security, and their freedom.”

MARKET MOVERS

— Growth stumbles for services sector, private payrolls. Reuters's Lucia Mutikani: ""U.S. services sector activity slowed in November as lingering concerns about trade tensions and worker shortages pushed production to its lowest level in a decade, which could heighten fears about the economy’s health. Other data on Wednesday showed private employers hired the fewest workers in six months in November. The reports came on the heels of data on Monday showing manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November and a decline in construction spending in October.

""The continued manufacturing slump and second straight monthly drop in construction outlays tempered growth expectations for the fourth quarter, which had been boosted by a rush of upbeat reports on the trade deficit, housing and business investment.

— Mnuchin warns of issues with global tax rewrite: “The U.S. has ‘serious concerns’ with proposals being discussed in the global rewrite of corporate tax rules, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as he introduced a new idea that could complicate a deal over adapting the tax system for the digital economy,” the Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin and Paul Hannon report.

“In a letter to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Mr. Mnuchin cited concerns raised by U.S. businesses. He said that changing the mandatory rules for when countries have the right to tax companies could affect ‘longstanding pillars of the international tax system upon which U.S. taxpayers rely’ … Nevertheless, Mr. Mnuchin’s reservations come as a surprise given that the broad outlines of new rules agreed to in October were based on ideas advanced by the U.S., which has long pushed for measures that cover all companies, not just those whose businesses are highly digital.”

— Dems see USMCA deal on horizon: “‘We are on the 2 1/2-yard line,’ Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal said about efforts to wrap up negotiations on the replacement for Nafta and clear the way for approval in Congress,” Bloomberg News’s Erik Wasson and Eric Martin report.

“Mexico’s top trade negotiator, Jesus Seade, was meeting … with his Trump administration counterpart Robert Lighthizer in Washington in an attempt to resolve final issues. Neal said rank-and-file Democrats would be briefed on the details of the talks later in the day. California Representative Jimmy Gomez, a member of the U.S. House Democrats negotiating team, said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Lighthizer have offered Mexico a compromise on labor enforcement that ‘respects Mexico’s sovereignty.’ ”

— China slams Pompeo over Huawei: “China’s envoy to the European Union hit back at what he called politically motivated U.S. warnings that Chinese telecom equipment makers should be kept out of European 5G networks,” Politico’s Laurens Cerulus reports.

“In response to an op-ed in Politico by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the head of the Chinese Mission to the EU said that claims about Huawei were ‘a far cry from the truth …’ “While Pompeo attacks the Chinese Communist Party and proudly claims the moral high ground, he forgets about the NSA’s notorious PRISM surveillance program and the wiretapping of America’s closest allies,” the Chinese diplomat added … Zhang was responding to the opinion article published Monday in which Pompeo wrote that ‘it’s critical that European countries not give control of their critical infrastructure to Chinese tech giants like Huawei, or ZTE.’ ”

— Amazon cloud boss chides Pentagon: “‘It’s fairly obvious that we feel pretty strongly that it was not adjudicated fairly,’ Amazon Web Services chief executive Andy Jassy said during a news conference at the company’s annual conference [in Las Vegas]. ‘If you do a truly objective, detailed, apples-to-apples comparison with the platforms, you don’t end up in a spot where the decision was made,’” my colleague Jay Greene reports.

“The contract, valued at up to $10 billion over 10 years, was awarded to Microsoft in October, and Amazon has formally challenged the Pentagon’s decision, filing a protest with the Court of Federal Claims last month that cites comments by President Trump as indicating bias against Amazon. Trump has repeatedly criticized Amazon, whose founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.”

— Under Pichai, Alphabet could face more scrutiny: “Alphabet’s leadership change has some investors hoping that the owner of Google will take a hard look at the cash-burning ventures championed by its founders,” Reuters’s Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich report.

“Shares of Alphabet rose 2% ... with some investors saying Pichai’s pragmatic approach and his background at Alphabet’s core business may make him less patient about money-losing projects fostered in recent years by [Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin]. One of the biggest changes for Pichai will be taking responsibility for those so-called ‘moonshots,’ which are aimed at diversifying Alphabet’s business.”

What those “moonshots” include: “Alphabet has plowed billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.”

“Alphabet has plowed billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.” Just how much is a Google worth?: Page and Brin “just got a $2.3 billion retirement gift from investors,” Bloomberg News’s Tom Metcalf reports. “They each own about 6% of the internet giant and still control Alphabet through special voting shares.""

— Expedia’s CEO, CFO ousted: “Expedia Group Inc.’s chief executive and finance chief were both forced to resign after clashing with Chairman Barry Diller and the board over the direction of the travel company,” the WSJ’s Patrick Thomas reports.

“The website that helps users find hotel rooms and flights said Wednesday that CEO Mark Okerstrom and financial chief Alan Pickerill would step down immediately from their roles, at the behest of the board. Expedia’s brands include Hotels.com, Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire and CarRentals.com.”

— Italy claims Fiat massively undervalued Chrysler: “Italian tax authorities have claimed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV underestimated the value of its American business by 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion) following its phased acquisition several years ago, presenting the carmaker with a potentially hefty bill as it prepares to merge with French rival PSA Group,” Bloomberg’s Daniele Lepido,Tommaso Ebhardt and Ania Nussbaum report.

“The dispute relates to the October 2014 restructuring that took place after the former Fiat SpA purchased the final part of its Chrysler unit, according to company filings and an Oct. 22 audit report seen by Bloomberg. The purchases stretched over five years and culminated in the full takeover of the once-bankrupt owner of brands such as Dodge, Ram and Jeep.”

— Billionaire, in need of cash: “Elon Musk says he doesn’t have a lot of cash. Musk’s wealth came up in the second day of his testimony before a federal jury in Los Angeles where the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive is on trial over a tweet in which he referred to a British cave expert as a ‘pedo guy,’” Bloomberg’s Dana Hull, Edvard Pettersson, and Tom Metcalf report.

“After an unsuccessful objection from his lawyer, Musk told the jury he has Tesla stock, and SpaceX stock, with debt against those holdings, and his net worth is about $20 billion. But contrary to public opinion, he said, he didn’t have much cash. Musk finished testifying after a total of about six hours on the stand over two days.”

— Walmart talks about how it collects data: “Walmart Inc for the first time … revealed the breadth of customer information it collects as it came out in favor of consumers having ‘reasonable controls’ with regard to collection, use and sharing of personal data,” Reuters’s Nandita Bose reports.

“The world’s largest retailer said shoppers should have an opportunity to ‘reasonably access, correct or delete their data while limiting the sale of their data to third parties and its use in digital advertising,’ as it testified at a hearing by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The hearing, which was also attended by companies like Microsoft, was convened to examine various legislative proposals to protect consumer data privacy.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)

— Biden releases $3.2 trillion tax plan: “Former vice president Joe Biden released a plan to raise $3.2 trillion in taxes over 10 years to pay for his domestic spending proposals, including on health care and climate, as he seeks to cast himself as the fiscal moderate in the Democratic presidential primary amid pressure from his liberal rivals,” my colleague Jeff Stein reports.

“Biden’s plan calls for raising the tax rate paid by corporations from 21 percent to 28 percent, still below the 35 percent level in place before the 2017 GOP tax cut law. He also plans to raise $800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors, as well as $400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes, among other measures … The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.”

How it compares: “The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s. Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.”

Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.” Less aggressive than it could have been: “Biden also opts not to adopt more-aggressive measures that had been under consideration by some advisers to his campaign, including a new tax on Wall Street transactions … Similarly, Biden proposes increasing the top income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent, where it was before the 2017 GOP tax law. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.”

The fight over Harris’s donors has begun: Sen. Kamala Harris’s “most affluent fundraisers, spanning from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, have been receiving calls and emails from people close to top-tier candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker. These people are hoping to snag the support of the bundlers and their donor networks,” CNBC’s Brian Schwartz reports.

Warren trolls Bloomberg on Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren accused former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg of trying to buy the 2020 election with millions of dollars in advertising to fuel his late entry into the Democratic race,” Bloomberg’s Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou and Joe Weisenthal report.

“Warren delivered her message in an interview on Bloomberg Television from the company’s headquarters in New York City. ‘I don’t believe that elections ought to be for sale,’ Warren said. ‘And I don’t think as a Democratic Party that we should say that the only way you’re going to get elected, the only way you’re going to be our nominee, is either if you are a billionaire or if you’re sucking up to billionaires.’”

That wasn’t all: Before the interview, Warren bought an ad to air on the network that directly attacked its owner-turned-candidate:

Warren proposes crackdown on bank mergers. NYT's Jeanna Smialek: ""Warren plans to introduce a bill in coming weeks that would intensify the scrutiny of bank mergers, a signal less of legislative action to come than of her intentions for the finance industry if she is elected president.

""The bill, a companion of which will be introduced Wednesday in the House by Representative Jesús 'Chuy' García, Democrat of Illinois, will almost certainly go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. But its argument that the 'review process for bank mergers is fundamentally broken' indicates that Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, still has the financial industry in her sights.""

New Georgia senator is ready to cut a big check to her campaign: “Soon-to-be Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler plans to spend $20 million of her own money on her 2020 Senate campaign in Georgia — a massive sum that could give potential rivals pause about trying to unseat her,” Politico’s Alex Isenstadt reports.

“Loeffler, a wealthy financial executive and co-owner of Atlanta’s WNBA team, was tapped Wednesday morning to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who is resigning later this month due to health problems, on an interim basis. She has told advisers in recent days of her intentions to tap her vast fortune to win next year's special election to complete Isakson's term, according to a person with direct knowledge of the decision.”

Loeffler is heavily connected to Bitcoin: “Loeffler has been the chief executive of Bakkt, the Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin-focused subsidiary, since the entity’s announcement in August 2018,” Coindesk’s Nikhilesh De reports. “Under her tenure, the company rolled out its physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts earlier this year.

She also used to be directly connected to the NYSE: Loeffler was “the chief communications and marketing officer and head of investor relations for the Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange, a financial trading platform that owns the New York Stock Exchange,” the Atlanta Journal Constitution's Jim Denery writes. “Intercontinental Exchange was founded by Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher.”

It is the least trusted name,” reads the complaint. “CNN is eroding the fabric of America, proselytizing, sowing distrust and disharmony. It must be held accountable.” Toward that end, Nunes is asking for $435,350,000 in connection with a Nov. 22 piece by CNN’s Vicky Ward.

The story hit the news just after the House Intelligence Committee held a series of impeachment hearings on the efforts of Trump, Rudolph W. Giuliani and his associates to dig up dirt in Ukraine on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Throughout those hearings, Nunes, the ranking Republican on the committee, sought to discredit the inquiry, not to mention the reporting of the mainstream media.

AD

Against that backdrop, Ward reported that Lev Parnas, an associate of Giuliani under indictment for campaign finance violations, is prepared to testify about “meetings the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee had in Vienna last year with a former Ukrainian prosecutor [Viktor Shokin] to discuss digging up dirt on Joe Biden.” That story was sourced to a lawyer representing Parnas.

In his lawsuit, Nunes cites some alleged problems with the story. One, Nunes reports that he didn’t go to Vienna or any other Austrian locale in 2018. Two, he says he has never met Shokin. Furthermore, the complaint makes the case that Parnas is an unreliable narrator who has spun shaky stories in the past, as documented in the media. “From all the evidence in its possession, CNN was well-aware that Parnas was a renowned liar, a fraudster, a hustler, an opportunist with delusions of grandeur, a man in financial in extremis laboring under the weight of a $500,000 civil judgment, and an indicted criminal defendant with a clear motive to lie,” argues the complaint. (Bolding added to highlight an important legal consideration.)

As a congressman, Nunes is what’s known in defamation law as a public figure. To prevail in such a case, Nunes needs to prove not that CNN acted negligently, but rather that it acted with “actual malice,” a standard that emerged from the 1964 Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan. To prove actual malice, a plaintiff needs to show that the news outlet either knew that it was publishing false information or that it proceeded with “reckless disregard” for the truth. It’s a hurdle placed at chest height to enable fearless reporting on government officials and — per a subsequent Supreme Court ruling — other people who seek the limelight.

“It is of the utmost consequence that the people should discuss the character and qualifications of candidates for their suffrages,” wrote Kansas Supreme Court Justice Rousseau Angelus Burch in 1908 — a comment cited by Justice William J. Brennan in the Times v. Sullivan ruling.

Reading through Nunes’s filing turns up little of the bombshell-level evidence he’d need to win, though there’s no telling what may turn up in discovery. What’s notable about the complaint, however, is that it’s not preposterous, unlike a number of complaints he has filed in 2019:

In March, he sued Twitter , some rabble-rousing accounts — named Devin Nunes’ Mom and Devin Nunes’ Cow — and Republican consultant Liz Mair. Those folks, he alleged, were engaged in a “concerted defamation campaign.""

In April, he sued the McClatchy newspaper chain over a story in the Fresno Bee about the activities of a winery in which Nunes holds a stake. Mair is also a defendant in this sut.

In September, he sued Hearst Magazines and journalist Ryan Lizza over a September 2018 feature story about his family’s dairy business.

“He’s filing these lawsuits and threatening these lawsuits purely to try to chill speech about himself and matters of public interest,” said Ted Boutrous, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, before the filing of the CNN suit. Boutrous is representing McClatchy in its courtroom battle against Nunes.

AD

Let’s pause on the Esquire piece. It alleges that Nunes has kept a “secret” about his family’s moving its dairy farm -- in which he has no stake or operational involvement -- to Iowa from California — even though Nunes’s “family dairy has been central to his identity and a feature of every major political profile written about him.” In his suit, Nunes denies that he has “a secret” and otherwise charges that Lizza “fabricated” the story line. If anything, the document does more to libel Lizza than Lizza ever did to Nunes: “Lizza stalked Plaintiff’s grammar-school aged nieces, behaved like a sex offender or pedophile cruising the local neighborhood for victims, frightened a family member to tears, and exploited a grieving mother.”

What emerges from the story and the lawsuit is that Nunes and his family didn’t like Lizza driving around in Sibley, Iowa, looking into their business; they didn’t like Lizza interviewing sources about their farm; they didn’t like Lizza finding out that the family requested that a journalist writing about their farm pointedly omit mention of Devin Nunes; and they didn’t like the allegation that the family farm had employed undocumented immigrants.

There are those who believe that a courtroom is the appropriate place to feud about alleged dairy secrets. “Kudos to Congressman Nunes for utilizing the court system to vindicate his reputation,” wrote defamation attorney Elizabeth Locke of Clare Locke LLP in an email (before the filing of the CNN suit). “In the United States, a defamation action that seeks monetary damages is the only remedy available to those who have been defamed. We should be celebrating, not disparaging, those who use the courts to resolve their disputes.”

AD

AD

And if Locke had her way, it would be easier for Nunes to prevail in his defamation actions. In an October discussion organized by the Heritage Foundation, Locke argued that the Times v. Sullivan ruling had spread a mind-set of immunity in U.S. newsrooms: “For the media, after having been told by their lawyers for so long that basically anything goes, it’s not surprising that journalism today and its standards have seriously eroded and basically anything goes,” said Locke, a defamation attorney who represented the University of Virginia official who successfully sued Rolling Stone magazine, among other noteworthy cases. (Disclosure: Locke represented a wealthy Republican donor in an action against Mother Jones, a case in which the wife of the Erik Wemple Blog was a defendant; the suit was thrown out.)

Lee Levine, a media defense attorney who stood up for Times v. Sullivan, decried lawsuits that aren’t intended to seek compensation for reputational damage but to “punish the press for speaking truth to power.” He said he wouldn’t be sitting at Heritage debating Times v. Sullivan if it hadn’t been for Trump’s campaign trail call in February 2016 to “open up” libel laws. (Disclosure: Levine’s firm, Ballard Spahr, represents The Post in several unrelated matters.)

At that time, a flood of analyses rushed to point out that a President Trump would lack the authority to reinterpret the First Amendment. In February of this year, however, Justice Clarence Thomas pitched a reconsideration of the actual-malice standard. The ruling in Times v. Sullivan, argued Thomas in a concurring opinion turning down an appeal of a defamation case, came out of history’s left field and didn’t originate in the thinking of the founders or early thought on the First Amendment. “We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified. The States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm. We should reconsider our jurisprudence in this area,” wrote Thomas.

According to defense lawyers for media outlets, excitement about an overturned Times v. Sullivan has started to leach into court filings. “I’ve seen a lot of it,” says Levine, noting that lawyers cite the “actual malice” standard in filings as a way of “preserving the issue” for possible future appeals. In an April memorandum for a defamation case stemming from a March 2018 New York Times story, attorney Barry Coburn of Coburn & Greenbaum PLLC wrote in a footnote, “So there is no doubt about our position, we respectfully submit that the time has come for the malice requirement in [Times v. Sullivan] to be reconsidered, for all of the reasons set forth by Justice Thomas … which we incorporate herein by reference. [Times v. Sullivan] was fashioned in whole cloth and in a sharp break from the common law and prior constitutional law,” argued Coburn.

However it was fashioned, Times v. Sullivan has been tremendously influential in the five-plus decades since it was issued. By declaring that public officials are fair game for aggressive coverage, it has molded an expectation that they will get just that. They might whine about the coverage, they might send nasty emails to editors, and they might craft fundraising appeals based on “media bias.” But they would stop short of filing nuisance suits for PR purposes.

A 1947 Supreme Court case, Craig v. Harney, rebuked a Texas judge who slapped journalists with a contempt of court conviction for coverage critical of his actions. “Judges are supposed to be men of fortitude,” wrote Justice Francis W. Murphy in a concurring opinion in the case, “able to thrive in a hardy climate.”

So are congressmen.

With his barrage of complaints, Nunes is threatening to overturn that governing culture. “I don’t think there’s any question that the tone the president has set … has legitimized in at least a large segment of the public official/public figure universe the tool of filing libel suits against your critics,” says Levine.

As for the idea that Times v. Sullivan has outfitted news outlets with an “anything goes” approach to their reporting: Please. There’s a great deal of evidence that the opposite is true — that news organizations, even with Times v. Sullivan in their back pockets, behave with caution when approaching powerful individuals. How many decades did it take the U.S. media to expose the alleged sexual harassment, abuse and assault of movie producer Harvey Weinstein? Investigative reporter Ronan Farrow recently published a book — “Catch and Kill” — documenting the internal obstacles he faced on the Weinstein story while at NBC News. (He published the story at the New Yorker, shortly after the New York Times published its own Weinstein exposé.)

How about Jeffrey Epstein? ABC News anchor Amy Robach, in a hot mic video surfaced last month by Project Veritas, spoke of how the network’s attempts to snare the story fell short of the network’s standards. Julie Brown, who did eventually break the story for the Miami Herald, tweeted:

One of the reasons I had trouble getting sources to cooperate with me on this story is that so many news outlets had bailed on the story that they were tired of talking to reporters who didn't do anything with it. I had to convince them that the Herald WAS going to print it. — julie k. brown (@jkbjournalist) November 5, 2019

It’s not just investigative work, either. News organizations have been hesitant to apply the “racist” descriptor to Trump despite all the evidence that was in existence even before the 2016 election. As for the president’s frequent lies, they often turn up in news reports as mere “falsehoods” or “inaccuracies.” Or not at all.

The problem isn’t that the media is too well-protected by the courts, as some would have you believe. It’s that the media doesn’t take full advantage of those protections, as fellows like Nunes fear it might.

THE BIG IDEA: After the 8 1/2-hour impeachment inquiry hearing wrapped up last night, Rep. Louie Gohmert (Tex.) joined the other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee for a news conference. “All I got to say is: If you love America, mamas, don't let your babies grow up to go to Harvard or Stanford law school,” Gohmert said.

Constitutional scholars from those two institutions, invited to testify by the Democrats, had just finished laying out arguments for why President Trump’s conduct warrants impeachment.

Gohmert’s quip was a play on the country song popularized by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson in 1978: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. … Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.”

It was a fitting coda to a day that showcased a virulent strain of anti-elitism, even anti-intellectualism, that has flared up as Trump hijacked the GOP from the establishmentarians who once called the shots.

Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the committee, set the tone in his opening statement. “America will see why most people don’t go to law school,” he declared. “No offense to our professors. But please. Really? We’re bringing you in here today to testify on stuff … that we already know, out of the classrooms that maybe you're getting ready for finals in, to discuss things that you probably haven't even had a chance to [read or watch].”

Collins, who just got passed over for a Senate appointment despite Trump pressuring the governor of Georgia to pick him, pooh-poohed a sober-minded discussion about when the Founding Fathers thought impeachment would be advisable as “esoteric.”

Paul Taylor, the chief counsel for Republicans on the committee, suggested as he began questioning the four witnesses that the legal profession as a whole is somehow controlled by the left. He claimed at the start of his questioning – without any citations – that 97 percent of campaign contributions from lawyers during the 2016 presidential campaign went to Hillary Clinton while Trump received only 3 percent. “And the situation is essentially the same at law schools around the country, including those represented on the panel here today,” Taylor said.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who told reporters at the start of the day how much he disliked attending lectures in law school, told Stanford Law School Professor Pamela Karlan that she was unable to see from “the ivory towers of your law school” how condescending she was being to “actual people in this country.”

And so it went.

-- The attacks on law schools and the legal profession in general reflect the broader focus on process and style over substance in Trump’s defense strategy. There is little dispute about the underlying facts of the case, even as a growing body of evidence directly ties Trump to an alleged conspiracy to coerce the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into a 2020 challenger, former vice president Joe Biden, in exchange for transferring nearly $400 million of military aid, which Congress had already approved, and scheduling a coveted meeting with a neophyte president who was desperate to project strength in the face of an ongoing Russian occupation in his country.

-- Marginalizing experts and debasing expertise have been hallmarks of the Trump presidency. Trump doesn’t just reject climate science. His administration has suppressed research. He’s purged nonpartisan experts from an array of government agencies. He still refuses to accept the consensus of the professionals in the intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to boost his candidacy.

The manager of Trump’s reelection campaign, Brad Parscale, referred to the scholars invited by Democrats to testify as “the Three Stooges” on Twitter. “Just more of the same old sham!” he wrote.

-- The criticism of the professional class offers another proof point to illustrate why so many white-collar suburbanites who have traditionally supported Republicans have defected during the Trump era. But Trump has proven to also be a magnet for non-college-educated whites in the Rust Belt who are ancestrally Democratic, accelerating a once-in-a-generation realignment.

-- Karlan replied forcefully to Collins’s suggestion that she knew not of what she spoke. “I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts. I’m insulted by the suggestion that, as a law professor, I don’t care about the facts,” Karlan said. “I spent all of Thanksgiving vacation sitting there, reading these transcripts. … I ate, like, a turkey that came to us in the mail that was already cooked because I was spending my time doing this.”

-- Rank-and-file Republicans have soured considerably on the value of colleges and universities in recent years. A Pew Research Center study published in August showed that only 33 percent of Republicans see value in higher education, down from 53 percent in 2012. “Roughly eight-in-ten Republicans (79%) say professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom is a major reason why the higher education system is headed in the wrong direction (only 17% of Democrats say the same),” according to Pew. “And three-quarters of Republicans (vs. 31% of Democrats) point to too much concern about protecting students from views they might find offensive as a major reason for their views.”

-- The criticism of the legal profession came even though 15 of the 17 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee hold law degrees. Overall, 161 House members and 53 senators earned juris doctorates, according to the Congressional Research Service.

-- House Democrats signaled there will be at least one article of impeachment related to the 10 episodes of potential obstruction of justice outlined in Robert Mueller’s report. “President Trump welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election. He demanded it for the 2020 election. In both cases, he got caught,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

-- University of North Carolina Law Professor Michael Gerhardt, one of the witnesses, testified that an obstruction case against Trump is a slam dunk, citing the administration’s stated refusal to comply with any subpoenas for documents and depositions. “In our law schools, we would teach our students this is an easy, straightforward situation,” he said.

Gerhardt also argued that what Trump asked of the Ukrainians is impeachable, as well. “I just want to stress that if what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" he said. “This is precisely the misconduct that the Framers created a Constitution including impeachment to protect against. … If we cannot impeach a president who uses his power for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy.”

-- Even the witness that Republicans invited to testify, George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley, said that Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “anything but perfect.” But Turley argued that it’s not impeachable and accused Democrats of rushing to impeach without the testimony of key witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton and Mike Pompeo – who are refusing, at Trump’s direction, to appear.“If you rush this impeachment, you’re going to leave half the country behind,” he said.He later called the Democratic case “not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous.”

-- “Impeachment goes to college” is how Dan Zak and Ben Terris framed the hearing in their write-up for the Style section: “After last month’s testimony from bow-tied diplomats and stone-faced bureaucrats — ‘fact witnesses’ who actually saw or heard Trump’s inciting behavior — the impeachment process has reached the peer-review phase. During this hearing, professors referenced a 1640 sermon by John Winthrop and a 1792 edition of Samuel Johnson’s dictionary. There were multiple odes to forgotten founder William Richardson Davie, the onetime governor of North Carolina who argued fiercely for an impeachment provision in drafts of the Constitution. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) had in front of him a tattered college copy of the Federalist Papers, scrawled with marginalia.”

-- When he got a chance to question Karlan, Gaetz noted that the professor has given campaign contributions to Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He asked her about a comment she made on a podcast that suggested liberals cluster in tighter communities while conservatives tend to spread out. “Do you understand how that reflects contempt on people who are conservative?” Gaetz asked. “No, what I was talking about there was the natural tendency -- if you put the quote in context – the natural tendency of a compactness requirement to favor a party whose voters are more spread out,” she answered. “I do not have contempt for conservatives.”

Karlan later apologized for “getting a little overheated.” She also apologized for quipping earlier in the day that “the president can name his son Barron,” but he can’t make him a baron. “It was wrong of me to do that,” she said, after Republicans attacked her. “I wish the president would apologize, obviously, for the things that he's done that are wrong, but I do regret having said that.”

“That does not lend credibility to your argument,” Gaetz told her. “It makes you look mean.”

-- One Republican on the committee also floated a new defense of the president: Everybody does it. Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said that basically every president could have been impeached under the standards cited by Democrats for abuse of power. “When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he was president, directed the IRS to conduct audits of his political enemies ... would that be impeachable conduct?” Buck asked Turley. “How about when President Kennedy directed his brother, Robert Kennedy, to deport one of his mistresses as an East German spy?”

“Turley said he couldn’t rule it out, nor could he do so when Buck asked about allegations that President Lyndon Johnson used the CIA to plant a spy in the campaign of his 1964 Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater,” Mike DeBonis notes. “Buck ultimately landed on Obama, pointing to his interpretation of the recess appointments power that was later rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court, as well as his response to the 2012 Benghazi attack.”

“Can you name a single president in the history of the United States — save President [William Henry] Harrison, who died 32 days after his inauguration — that would not have met the standard of impeachment for our friends here?” Buck asked.

“I would hope to God James Madison would escape,” said Turley, who has written about Madison. “Otherwise, a lifetime of academic work would be shredded. But once again, I can’t exclude many of these acts.”

Buck reasoned that, if Democrats impeach Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine, Republicans will impeach the next Democratic president if they have control of the House because the concept of what’s in the “national interest” is so open for debate.

“Some people live in an ivory tower and some people live in a swamp,” Buck said. “And those of us that are in the swamp are doing our very best for the American people, but it’s not pretty.”

“Well, actually, I live in an ivory tower in a swamp because I'm at G.W.,” Turley replied. “But it's not so bad.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a brief speech this morning that she’s asked House committee chairs to proceed with articles of impeachment, saying lawmakers have “no choice but to act.” “The president has engaged in abuse of power undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections,” she said. “His actions are in defiance of the vision of our founders and the oath of office that he takes to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Sadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our Founders and our heart full of love for America, today I’m asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.” She didn’t give any indication of how quickly the process would move.

-- Attorney General Bill Barr’s handpicked prosecutor, John Durham, told Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that he can’t back up the right-wing conspiracy theory that the Russia investigation was a setup by American intelligence. Horowitz’s office contacted Durham, “the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett scoop. “The inspector general also contacted several U.S. intelligence agencies. Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign … But the intelligence agencies said the professor was not among their assets … And Durham informed Horowitz’s office that his investigation had not produced any evidence that might contradict the inspector general’s findings on that point. … That could rebut conservatives’ doubts — which Barr has shared with associates in recent weeks — that Horowitz might be blessing the FBI’s Russia investigation prematurely and that Durham could potentially find more, particularly with regard to the Maltese professor.”

-- Rudy Giuliani, trying to poke holes in the case against his client, is in Kyiv and Budapest this week to talk with former Ukrainian prosecutors. From the Times’ Ken Vogel and Benjamin Novak: “Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk … Mr. Giuliani is using the trip … to help prepare more episodes of a documentary series for a conservative television outlet promoting his pro-Trump, anti-impeachment narrative. His latest moves to advance the theories propounded by the prosecutors amount to an audacious effort to give the president’s supporters new material to undercut the House impeachment proceedings and an eventual Senate trial.”

-- The White House is preparing for an aggressive effort to defend Trump in the Senate. Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian report: “Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs, told reporters that Trump ‘wants his case made fully in the Senate,’ previewing a strategy that would include live witnesses on the floor, rather than videotaped depositions that were entered into evidence during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999. … Ueland was among a quartet of top White House officials, including Counsel Pat Cipollone, who met with GOP senators on Wednesday as the administration continues to strategize with Republicans on the Senate proceedings. The private session … underscored the extent to which Trump has largely blown off the House inquiry and is focusing on a likely trial in the GOP-controlled Senate, where the White House says he would get a fair defense and can easily win an acquittal.”

-- But Trump opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee’s first hearing, unlike Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. Paul Kane reports: “Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump’s side.”

-- Joe Biden said he would not voluntarily appear as a witness in a Senate impeachment trial if called to testify. Colby Itkowitz reports: “‘No, I’m not going to let them take their eye off the ball,’ Biden said [in Iowa]. … ‘The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes. And I’m not going to let them divert from that, I’m not going to let anyone divert from that.’ Biden added that he’d released 21 years of his tax returns, so if Trump is worried about corruption, ‘let him release some of his.’”

-- Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) announced he will not seek reelection. From Politico: “Heck, 67, was first elected in 2012 to represent a [solidly blue] district southwest of Seattle. He said in a Medium post he had time over the Thanksgiving recess for ‘rest and reflection,’ which led to his retirement decision. … Heck also wrote that the process of compiling the intelligence committee's recent impeachment report had left him ‘discouraged’ about continuing to serve in Congress. ‘The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary,’ Heck wrote. ‘I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Undocumented workers who served Trump recall his habits and outbursts: Joshua Partlow and Dave Fahrenthold have interviewed 48 people this year who worked illegally for the Trump Organization at 11 of its properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Virginia: “They have seen poolside tantrums and holiday arguments. They’ve laughed with the in-laws and watched after the grandkids. Their recollections also show how Trump’s entrance into presidential politics — denouncing illegal immigrants as criminals and job-stealers — upended their lives and prompted some of them to publicly confront their former boss.” Here are choice nuggets from their must-read piece:

“It was important for Sandra Diaz to be invisible. Before entering the Trump family villa, she would tie back her hair, pull on latex gloves and step into delicate paper shoe coverings. She knew not to wear makeup or perfume that might leave the faintest trace of her presence. As Donald Trump’s personal housekeeper, Diaz was dealing with a fussy celebrity owner who presided like a monarch over the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster long before he was elevated to president. She was an immigrant from Costa Rica working illegally for Trump with a fake Social Security card she had bought for $50. Being invisible was her life’s work. Moving quickly through the two-story house in the mornings, Diaz carried out Trump’s fastidious instructions. In his closet, she would hang six sets of identical golf outfits: six white polo shirts, six pairs of beige pants, six neatly ironed pairs of boxer shorts. …

“Those who cooked and served Trump knew that he liked … his Diet Coke in small glass bottles with a plastic straw that no one could be seen touching. Trump loved Tic Tacs. But not an arbitrary amount. He wanted, in his bedroom bureau at all times, two full containers of white Tic Tacs and one container that was half full. The same rule applied to the Bronx Colors-brand face makeup from Switzerland that Trump slathered on — two full containers, one half full — even if it meant the housekeepers had to regularly bring new shirts from the pro shop because of the rust-colored stains on the collars. A special washing machine in the laundry room was reserved for his wife Melania Trump’s clothing. Donald Trump liked Irish Spring bar soap in his shower. But his housekeepers quickly learned not to throw out his soap even if it had worn down to the tiniest sliver: Trump decided when he wanted something discarded. When that happened, with clothes or newspapers, he would toss them on the floor.

“A regular recipient of Trump’s castoff clothing was Melania’s father, Viktor Knavs … ‘They’re the same size and everything,’ [said Victorina Morales, Diaz’s successor as Trump’s housekeeper at Bedminster]. Knavs and his wife, Amalija Knavs, were favorites of the Bedminster staff, even if much was lost in translation from Slovenian to Spanish. … One day in 2013, Viktor Knavs went out to play golf wearing one of Trump’s discarded red baseball caps. When Trump spotted him on the fairway, he blew up, and he ordered his father-in-law, in front of other golfers, to remove the hat and get off the course. … Diaz and Morales were in the villa when Knavs returned, threw the hat on the ground and cursed Trump. The housekeepers pieced together the story from what Amalija Knavs told them in English and what they heard from the caddies who were on the course at the time. ‘Nobody could wear the red hat but [Trump],’ Diaz said.”

-- The Post’s year-long investigation on Trump’s employment of undocumented workers has led to these five additional findings:

At least 11 Trump properties hired undocumented workers, some who said they started working for Trump 17 years ago. Trump said in July he wasn't sure if his company employed undocumented workers. But many former workers said it's hard to believe that the managers didn't know. The Trump Organization didn’t face many legal consequences for using undocumented labor. The workers, however, have lost their jobs and have found it hard to get back on their feet after being fired by the organization. Some have also been ostracized by other undocumented workers who fear that the attention might put them at greater deportation risk. While some of the undocumented workers entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, others arrived on flights with tourist visas that they overstayed. In those cases, Trump’s promised border wall wouldn’t have mattered.

-- A gunman opened fire at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam near Honolulu, killing two and injuring a third before killing himself, base officials said. Reis Thebault and Marisa Iati report: “The shooter was identified as an active-duty U.S. Navy sailor and the three victims as civilian Defense Department employees working on the base’s shipyard. The surviving victim is at a hospital in stable condition, Rear Adm. Robb Chadwick said in a Wednesday evening news conference. The shooter’s motive is still unknown, Chadwick said, and it wasn’t yet clear whether the attack was targeted or random.”

-- Birds are getting smaller, and scientists believe it’s because of global warming. Ben Guarino reports: “So shows an analysis of migratory birds that died after colliding into buildings in Chicago and were collected as specimens for the Field Museum of Natural History. David Willard, a Field Museum ornithologist, has measured the Windy City’s dead birds since 1978. Data from his calipers and scales reveal decades-long trends in bird bodies: Their legs, on average, are growing shorter. They have lost weight. Their wings are getting slightly longer. These changes are present in nearly all of the species he measured, according to a study of 70,716 bird specimens from almost 40 years published Wednesday in the journal Ecology Letters. Morphing birds, Willard and his colleagues say, reflect a changing climate. ‘Warming temperatures seem to be having a pretty consistent and almost universal effect on a large number of different species, regardless of other aspects of their biology,’ said study author Benjamin Winger, who studies the evolution and ecology of birds at the University of Michigan.”

-- The freak storms of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season have left behind a trail of destruction. Matthew Cappucci reports: “Both Dorian and Lorenzo, which became the strongest hurricane to develop so far northeast in the Atlantic, attained Category 5 strength. The storms brought the count of Category 5s in the Atlantic since 2016 up to six, and marked the fourth year in a row with at least one Category 5, the longest stretch on record. The historic intensity of both Dorian and Lorenzo, along with the record-setting rains produced by storms Barry and Imelda in the United States, exhibited influences consistent with warming ocean waters and climate change. … This year had an above-average season. It was only the seventh season since the 1930s to rack up multiple Category 5s over the Atlantic Basin. Across the board, 24 percent more ‘accumulated cyclone energy’ than average was expended by storms this season. It also brought about one of the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfalls on record. But many in the United States view the season as a reprieve for the storm-beleaguered country, noting that only two hurricanes made landfall in the United States this season, along with one tropical storm. Both hurricanes were at Category 1 strength when they did so. The year was still incredibly active; the contiguous United States just got lucky.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Trump administration is considering sending 14,000 more troops to the Middle East to counter Iran. From the Wall Street Journal: “The deployment could double the number of U.S. military personnel who have been sent to the region since the start of a troop buildup in May. [Trump] is expected to make a decision on the new deployments as soon as this month … There is growing fear among U.S. military and other administration officials that an attack on U.S. interests and forces could leave the U.S. with few options in the region ... By sending additional military resources to the region, the administration would be presenting a more credible deterrent to Tehran, which has been blamed for a series of attacks, including one in September against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Iran has denied involvement.”

-- U.S. intelligence officials believe Iran is secretly moving missiles into Iraq. From the New York Times: “New intelligence about Iran’s stockpiling of missiles in Iraq is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s efforts to deter Tehran by increasing the American military presence in the Middle East has largely failed. The missiles pose a threat to American allies and partners in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and could endanger American troops ... Both Iran and Iraq have been gripped in recent weeks by sometimes violent public protests. In Iraq, some are protesting against Iranian influence.”

-- German authorities said they suspect that Russian agents were behind an execution-style killing in Berlin in the summer and expelled two Russian diplomats in connection with the case. Loveday Morris reports from Berlin and Robyn Dixon reports from Moscow: “The federal public prosecutor said there was ‘sufficient factual evidence’ that the Aug. 23 killing was carried out by Russian intelligence agencies or those of Russia’s Chechen Republic. The German Foreign Ministry declared two employees of the Russian Embassy in Berlin ‘persona non gratae,’ saying that Russian authorities have not cooperated with the investigation ‘sufficiently’ despite repeated ‘high-ranking’ requests. The killing compounds concerns about Russia’s efforts to assassinate political opponents on European soil less than two years after Britain accused Moscow of attacking former Russian agent turned informant Sergei Skripal with nerve agent in Salisbury, England. … [This] would represent the first such slaying on German soil since the end of the Cold War. It threatens to stymie relations between Berlin and Moscow, a fragile bond for Germany, which tries to balance political differences against its energy needs.

“Berlin prosecutors named the victim, who was shot in the head in a central Berlin park, as ‘Tornike K.’ — a 40-year-old Russian-Georgian citizen … Between 2000 and 2004, he commanded a Chechen militia that fought Russian forces during the Russian-Chechen war … The slain man also fought with a Georgian unit defending South Ossetia during the 2008 Georgia-Russia war … He survived a 2015 assassination attempt, despite being shot four times, and later fled to Germany, where he claimed asylum. … [H]e was tailed by a man on an electric bicycle before being shot with a Glock-26 pistol.” This is right out of the Kremlin's playbook.

-- Ukranian and Russian leaders will try to seal a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and agree on prisoner swaps when they meet next week. From Reuters: “With Kiev politically constrained and Moscow unlikely to bend, prospects for peace remain bleak, diplomats said. … Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions. Key to the accords are elections in the disputed eastern Donbass region of Ukraine. But both sides accuse each other of failing to stick to the deal, which includes restoring Ukrainian state control over the entire border with Russia and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the conflict zone.”

-- As the NATO summit concluded, ""Trump abruptly canceled a planned news conference, saying that he had already answered so many questions from reporters in other settings during his visit to Britain. He took off for Washington,"" Michael Birnbaum, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report from London. ""Though his conduct here fit his pattern of disruption at international summits, Trump did not make the fiery threats that have punctuated previous gatherings. NATO leaders were almost giddy as they survived another encounter with Trump with their alliance intact. Trump’s canceled news conference — eliminating one last chance for him to take aim at them — was to many the departure gift.”

-- The British Conservative Party breathed a sigh of relief after Trump left the U.K. without smashing its election strategy. From Politico: “It means [Boris Johnson] survived the Trump visit without any extra obstacles being put in his way ahead of the December 12 vote. … Johnson spent two days working hard to avoid being pictured with Trump, who is deeply unpopular in the U.K. He did not greet the president at the door of Downing Street when world leaders arrived for a reception on Wednesday night. The only photos of Johnson and Trump together were the full NATO group shot and the obligatory opening handshake snap.”

-- France is bracing for massive transportation disruptions starting today as trade unions launch a strike in response to changes Emmanuel Macron wants to make to the country’s retirement system. James McAuley reports: “Much of the Paris Metro will be shut down, as will many national and international train lines, including certain Eurostar services. Flights also will be canceled, as air traffic controllers say they will join the protests through Saturday. Strikes and protests, of course, are a well-known fixture of French life, from the student uprisings of 1968 to the ‘yellow vest’ demonstrations against inequality that stunned the French government last year with their vigor and violence. No other Western democracy seems to have as high a tolerance for burning cars and broken windows. But these protests could be bigger and more destabilizing than most.”

-- Australia is blocking asylum seekers held offshore from seeking medical care in the country. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton claims the policy has helped people migrate into Australia ‘through the back door.’ Physicians and refugee advocates say it has saved sick asylum seekers’ lives. And Wednesday, Australian lawmakers voted narrowly to revoke the policy, in what Doctors Without Borders described as a move that ‘endangers patients in need and ignores the ethical framework of the entire medical profession.’ At least 135 asylum seekers have sought treatment or assessment in Australia since the policy was approved this year. The law required physicians to deem their transfer to Australia necessary. It is unclear whether these asylum seekers are still in Australia.”

2020 WATCH:

-- The Democratic candidates have joined a new race – courting supporters of Kamala Harris. Annie Linskey, Chelsea Janes and Holly Bailey report: “Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next. … The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters. At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and [Biden] appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women. The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.”

-- Democrats were once excited about their diverse candidate field. That thrill is gone. Michael Scherer reports: “A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white. … The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black. … The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.”

-- Biden said he would consider Harris as a potential running mate. From CNN: “‘Of course I would,’ Biden said. ‘Look, Sen. Harris has the capacity to be anything she wants to be. I mean it sincerely. I talked to her yesterday. She's solid, she can be president someday herself, she can be vice president, she could go on to be a Supreme Court justice, she could be attorney general. I mean she has enormous capability.’”

-- The former vice president has not been energizing voters during his week-long bus tour around Iowa. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “The ‘No Malarkey’ tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails [Pete] Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors...""

-- Camping out in New Hampshire: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard rented a small house outside of Manchester, N.H., for the last months before the primary. From WMUR9: “‘We had a town hall in Rochester and then in Gilford right before the storm hit, and people said, 'You must be getting out of town,' and nope, we're here for the duration,’ Gabbard said. Gabbard tweeted out a photo of a snowbound yoga session at her new place Tuesday.”

-- A Republican House candidate called for Rep. Ilhan Omar’s (D-Minn.) execution. Katie Mettler and Hannah Knowles report: “In a fundraising letter sent last week and first reported on Tuesday by the Tampa Bay Times, the campaign of George Buck, a St. Petersburg Republican running for Congress, repeated falsehoods about Omar’s alleged ties to foreign nations. ‘We should hang these traitors where they stand,’ the email said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In an initial comment to that newspaper, Buck denied writing the campaign email, which arrived in the form of a letter and bore his signature. ‘That was not me. I did not see that,’ Buck told Times reporter Steve Contorno. ‘I would never talk like that.’ But Buck sent another statement later in the day that cited the federal punishment for treason, which includes death, prison time of at least five years and a fine of not less than $10,000. … House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (La.) disavowed Buck’s words in a statement Wednesday, saying ‘there’s no place for inciting violence in politics.’”

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) shows no signs of voluntarily resigning from the House, despite his guilty plea to a felony campaign finance charge. From Politico: “When asked Wednesday about whether and when he intended to resign, Hunter blew off the question. ‘Good talk,’ Hunter told a Politico reporter. So far, neither Republican nor Democratic leaders have pressured Hunter to leave office, although there is precedent for expelling members who don’t step down following a criminal conviction. Hunter is not scheduled to be sentenced until March 17.”

Wouldn’t the candidate who at one point earned the support of more than 46 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in 2016 be well positioned four years later? Particularly given the size of the field, locking down a big chunk of the electorate could be a huge advantage.

Polling of the 2020 race has indeed shown remarkably stability in Sanders’s numbers, as one might expect from someone with an enduring base — but not particularly strong support. Sanders’s standing in the polls has ranged over only 10 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average, a smaller range than any of the five candidates who at some point hit at least 10 percent in that average.

On 70 percent of days over the past year, Sanders’s poll average has been between 15 and 18 percent.

The question, then, is who that 15 to 18 percent of the electorate is. Which groups have stuck with Sanders four years after his first bid?

AD

AD

To answer that question, we pulled Washington Post-ABC News polling from September 2015 (when he was still a long shot), March 2016 (when he was closing in on Clinton) and our poll released in early November. We have comparable data for a number of demographic groups, including age, gender, ideology, race, education and income.

Here’s support for Sanders by demographic in all three polls. The numbers show the change in support from the group from the 2015 or 2016 poll until the one released last month. What we’re looking for are places where support dropped a lot — or not much at all.

Almost uniformly, the drops from the March 2016 poll are dramatically larger than the drops from the September 2015 poll, a reflection of the surge Sanders saw as he became the sole viable alternative to Clinton. It suggests, though, that his support at that point was largely a function of his position in the race; that they didn’t become part of his political base.

AD

AD

Two demographic groups in particular stand out. One is nonwhite Democratic voters, a group that was a significant factor in his 2016 loss. Sanders’s support in primaries correlated inversely to the density of black voters, and Clinton’s delegate lead was largely a function of her dominating in heavily black states. In our November poll, he does 9 points better with nonwhites than he did four years earlier. Important caveat: The margin of sampling error for the group is 8.5 percent, so this may just be noise.

The other group that sticks out is whites with a college degree. Sanders’s support with that group dropped significantly from September 2015 until now. (It’s probably a big reason his support with whites overall similarly dropped.) Back then, Sanders did much better with whites without a degree than with those who had a degree, in part because his support has consistently skewed younger. (Note that his support among younger voters is now about what it was in September 2015, while his support with people over 50 has dropped.)

In our November poll, we see where those whites with college degrees went: to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Those 50 and over went to former vice president Joe Biden.

Of course, Sanders still leads with young people, if we consider people under 50 as uniformly “young.” (We should, in my humble, not-old opinion.) There are four groups where Sanders earned more than 20 percent support both four years ago and in November: people under 50, men, those making less than $50,000 a year and liberals. However, his support among liberals dropped 7 points (within the margin of error). Warren led with that group in our most recent poll.

AD

AD

In other words, Sanders’s base now appears to be mostly what it was four years ago, with the exception of college-educated whites. That group, of course, is central to the candidacy of a Democrat who was barely known four years ago: Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.

Take Buttigieg and Warren out of the race, and it would be interesting to see where Sanders lands. Perhaps the most likely place? In a one-on-one contest against a more moderate Democrat with strong black support.

In other words, he’d end up in familiar territory.

Andriy Derkach is an independent member of Ukraine’s parliament who has caught Giuliani’s eye by pushing for his own government to investigate former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden. As Time magazine reports, though, Derkach hasn’t really produced any information suggesting actual wrongdoing, and he hasn’t gotten much traction.

AD

Derkach’s name is a big one in Ukraine. A story about him might have even helped sparked that country’s 2004 Orange Revolution. That story involved a murder plot that implicated his father.

AD

The story is from 2000, and it suggested the younger Derkach could be the “Ukrainian Putin.” At the time, that label — a reference to Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin — was applied to a number of potential successors to President Leonid Kuchma.

Derkach said he was “highly irritated” by the label, according to a transcript of an interview with a local weekly magazine published by the BBC. The source of his irritation wasn’t because it was then a comparison to a strongman; No one knew at the time what Putin would make of his power over the following decade or so. Derkach did not want to be seen as having presidential ambitions.

AD

Kuchma didn’t appear to appreciate the article either. The online journalist Kuchma pegged as being behind it, Georgiy Gongadze, had been very critical of him.

AD

According to the English-language Kyiv Post, later-released recordings that allegedly captured Kuchma and his top aides featured them discussing the article and what to do about Gongadze. One of those aides just happened to be Derkach’s father, Leonid Derkach, who was the head of Ukraine’s security services.

According to Andrew Wilson’s book “Ukraine’s Orange Revolution,” here’s what the recording — which Kuchma claimed was of him but had been doctored — showed them discussing on June 12, 2000:

AD

KUCHMA: This Gongadze, right? LEONID DERKACH: Yes, yes. KUCHMA: You can take care of him? LEONID DERKACH: The time for him to mouth off will come to an end. I’ll crush this f---er.

In later conversations, they spoke more explicitly about organizing Gongadze’s abduction. Another aide said to “take [Gongadze] to Georgia and dump him there,” to which Kuchma responded, “The Chechens should kidnap him and ask for a ransom!” The man identified as Kuchma would return to the Chechen idea in another recording.

AD

Gongadze would soon claim he was being followed, and by September he was killed, his headless body discovered in a forest near Kyiv in November. Soon after, the above recordings, which had been made by an security service officer named Mikola Melnichenko who fled the country, were released.

They sparked protests calling for Kuchma’s ouster. Kuchma would survive it, but his governing coalition collapsed, and he was forced to fire Leonid Derkach. Some consider the protests to have set in motion the Orange Revolution of 2004, in which the demonstrations forced a redo of an allegedly corrupt election won by Kuchma’s chosen successor. The new election resulted in the election of a pro-Western leader, Viktor Yushchenko.

AD

Even Yuschenko’s government would struggle to provide accountability for Gongadze’s killing. In 2005, a Ukrainian parliamentary commission labeled Kuchma, Leonid Derkach and two other senior officials as being the masterminds of the plot. One of the other two, former interior minister Yuri Kravchenko, had been found dead of an alleged suicide earlier that year.

AD

The elder Derkach, a former KGB officer, was never charged with wrongdoing. Now his son, who attended the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow and formerly belonged to a pro-Russian political party, is working with Giuliani to try to affect another major election This one is in the United States, four years after the real Putin interfered in one.

He gave no reason at all to regard the evidence gathered by [Rep. Adam B. Schiff] as insufficient to establish impeachable offenses.” Tribe also tweeted that Turley made a fatal error in pointing out a “French mistress” would be a “thing of value” in a bribery case. Tribe observed, “Fake dirt on Biden was of way more value to Trump than any number of French (or Russian) mistresses. [Turley] has cooked Trump’s French goose.”

Turley made some arguments that frankly do leave one wondering why Republicans thought he would be valuable. For example, Turley acknowledged, “[Trump’s] call was anything but ‘perfect’ and his reference to the Bidens was highly inappropriate.” It was highly “inappropriate” because we do not invite foreign governments to investigate political rivals. The “ask” was in and of itself a serious and impeachable act, especially given Trump’s own statements that he will continue to invite foreign meddling.

AD

AD

Turley also confessed, “The use of military aid for a quid pro quo to investigate one’s political opponent, if proven, can be an impeachable offense.” And we would assume that conditioning a White House meeting desperately needed by an ally could also be an impeachable act. Well, we had multiple witnesses including Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testify to precisely that. Experienced prosecutors, I am quite certain, could get a conviction under the criminal standard, beyond a reasonable doubt.

Even Turley’s primary excuse for not proceeding to impeachment is helpful to Democrats. They cannot, he says, do a thorough investigation without the testimony of key senior officials. Hmm, doesn’t that mean Trump has obstructed Congress in a way Richard Nixon never did? (Turley incorrectly asserted that Nixon defied court orders; in fact, the third of his impeachment articles referenced refusal to respond to subpoenas.)

Turley would prefer Congress wait for the testimony of figures such as former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Conservative lawyer and Trump antagonist George Conway suggests, “In the spirit of compromise, which I think is missing from this age, may I suggest this: Let’s impeach him now but keep investigating, and if we find more evidence, impeach him again.”

AD

AD

That shouldn’t be taken merely as a taunt. Why not impeach Trump now for inviting a foreign power to investigate an individual to further the president’s reelection spots and hold off until we get definitive rulings on witnesses who would bolster an article of impeachment based on the quid pro quo (aid and a meeting for dirt)? Even without additional witnesses, Congress could still impeach on the quid pro quo based on earlier testimony.

In short, Republicans once more appear to be their own worst enemies. “Ultimately, [Turley’s] presence is a reminder of the hypocrisy of the Republican position. He testified before Congress to advocate for Bill Clinton’s impeachment,” former prosecutor Joyce White Vance tells me. “But now, he’s concerned about the country’s future if we impeach a president who endangered our national security to [get] extra help with his campaign from a vulnerable ally.” If Turley is an example of the type of witnesses they think helpful, perhaps Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) should allow them to call many more.

President Trump's pro-Wall Street record will leave him little room on the campaign trail next year to reprise the anti-industry pose he struck in 2016.

That was in fresh evidence as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the onetime Goldman Sachs executive, appeared on Capitol Hill to defend the Trump administration’s deregulation of the financial services industry and criticize Democratic proposals to tax and scrutinize it.

Mnuchin spent most of his time before the House Financial Services Committee in the weeds of financial oversight. But the hearing also offered a preview of what Democratic strategists believe will be a potent line of attack to press against Trump on the campaign trail.

And at least one former Trump official agrees the president is vulnerable on this front. “There’s some truth to the idea that it would be smart for a Democrat nominee to focus on the closeness between the Trump White House and Goldman Sachs,” the former White House official tells me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. “That would be some inherently good messaging for Democrats to use.”

Mnuchin in his appearance offered a full-throated critique of a tax on financial transactions embraced by some Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. And the Treasury secretary faced sharp questions from Democrats about the administration’s moves to shrink the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the post-crisis board charged with coordinating the federal government’s regulation of the financial system.

Mnuchin said the Treasury Department is working to study the impact of the potential financial transactions tax. “I am very concerned that that would destroy our capital markets, and the cost to American holders of mutual funds would bear the majority of the cost,"" Mnuchin said.

But it likely will remain a popular concept on the campaign trail: A version introduced by congressional Democrats would raise an estimated $777 billion over a decade, a considerable sum for the party’s White House hopefuls looking to fund pricey social welfare expansions while reining in the industry.

To be sure, not all Democratic presidential candidates are embracing a financial transactions tax. But even former vice president Joe Biden, arguably the field’s moderate pacesetter, is pushing a tax plan that would mean a significantly higher burden for big banks. His plan, released this week, would bump the corporate rate up from 21 percent to 28 percent, effectively halving the windfall the industry reaped from Trump’s tax cuts.

Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says the Trump cuts, whose second anniversary arrives this month, present a ripe target for Democrats to make the case the president has betrayed the populist pitch he made in 2016. She tells me focus groups she’s conducted with disaffected Trump voters reveal they are “really, really mad” about the corporate windfall the cuts yielded, “and a remarkable number of people know about companies like Amazon that aren’t paying any taxes.” (To that end, Biden is proposing a 15 percent minimum corporate tax.)

Lake says going after the failed promise of the tax cuts could become “a very powerful component” of a broader case against the president’s coziness with corporate interests. Another focus group of Trump voters — conducted in Michigan’s swing Macomb County by Democracy Corps, a project by Democratic strategists James Carville and Stanley Greenberg — struck on the framing back in March 2017. From that report:

“When his cabinet is described as full of campaign donors, Goldman Sachs bankers (bailed out by the taxpayers) and people who use undocumented workers in their homes, they question whether this is the Donald Trump they voted for. “That right there seems to be two-faced,” and Trump is now “just the puppet” doing what Goldman Sachs want. Most important, this means they won’t get the changes they wanted and it’s possible “we’re in for another four or possibly eight years of the same old same old.”

But the former White House official argued not all Democratic candidates are on the same footing when it comes to challenging Trump’s Wall Street advocacy. Trump, he said, can lean into his trade wars — anathema to C-suites and Wall Street — to argue his populist credentials are intact if he’s running against a more moderate, trade-friendly Democrat. “Both sides are going to attempt versions of the same argument against the other,” he said. But “Sanders will have a better time making the argument against Trump than a Biden or [South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete] Buttigieg.”

— Trade deficit shrinks: “The U.S. trade deficit dropped to its lowest level in nearly 1-1/2 years in October, suggesting trade could contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter, though a broad decline in imports hinted at a slowdown in domestic demand,” Reuters’s Lucia Mutikani reports.

“Still, consumer spending is likely to remain supported by a strong labor market. Other data … showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, hitting their lowest level in seven months. The reports countered data this week showing manufacturing activity contracting for a fourth straight month in November, a slowdown in growth in the services sector as well as a drop in construction spending in October.”

Oh, right ...: “China’s trade negotiations with the U.S. remain on track, Beijing said, offering official reassurance after tensions flared between the world’s two biggest economies over human-rights issues in China,” the Wall Street Journal’s Grace Zhu, Eva Dou and Bob Davis report.

“The negotiating teams from both sides have maintained close communications, China’s Commerce Ministry said ... though it didn’t provide details on progress. The recent strain had spooked investors and stoked concerns about the global economic outlook.”

The U.S. is not as optimistic (again): “During the past few days, though, officials in the U.S. have become less optimistic about a deal. The two nations remain at odds over the value of U.S. farm goods Beijing would buy, with [Trump] looking for $40 billion to $50 billion a year within two years.”

— Canada’s trade surplus is a work of art: “New York’s art scene is suddenly skewing Canada’s trade balance with the U.S.,” Bloomberg News’s Shelly Hagan and Erik Hertzberg report.

“A shipment of paintings and sculptures potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars helped drive an increase in exports in October, Statistics Canada said … That resulted in the northern nation’s widest surplus with its biggest trading partner since the 2008 financial crisis … Canadian trade data is often skewed by high-value items. The import of an expensive piece of machinery for an offshore oil project in 2016 led to one of Canada’s biggest ever trade deficits with the world.”

“‘Warning of “uncharted territory,’ Trump asked the court for the second time to review rulings from lower courts that have said Congress and state prosecutors have a right to review his personal and business records … The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider a related case at its private conference Dec. 13. It involves a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that granted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. similar access to Trump’s financial records, which are held by his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA. The company has said it will comply with final court orders.”

— The U.S. tax burden is now one of the lowest in the world: “Trump’s 2017 tax cuts reduced the U.S. tax burden to one of the lowest among major world economies, according to a … report by an intergovernmental organization,” the WSJ’s Richard Rubin reports.

“U.S. tax burdens dropped by the largest amount among those countries in 2018, and the U.S. now has lower taxes than all but three countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the report said … Measured as a share of the U.S. economy, taxes are now 10 percentage points below the 2018 OECD average of 34.3 percent. Among 34 countries with preliminary 2018 data, the U.S. tax burden is lower than everywhere except Chile, Ireland and Mexico. The tax cut drove U.S. taxes below Turkey’s, and taxes in France and Denmark are now nearly twice what they are in the U.S.”

“The state-controlled Saudi Arabian Oil Co., commonly known as Aramco, said it would sell 3 billion shares, or a 1.5% stake of the company, at 32 Saudi riyals ($8.53), or at the top of the targeted range of 30 to 32 riyals for a total of $25.6 billion.

The leadership change follows sustained improvements in the company’s performance, plus aggressive growth — overseen by [Kirby] — that moved United past American to become the second-largest U.S. carrier by traffic. Strong profit has helped the company’s stock outperform that of rivals. United has beat analysts’ earnings expectations in 11 of the past 12 quarters. During Mr. Munoz’s tenure, United’s shares have risen 53 percent, compared with a 24 percent rise in the NYSE airline stock index.”

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). (Scott Morgan/Reuters)

— Warren goes after Buttigieg: Warren called on Buttigieg ""to open his campaign fund-raising events to the news media and to release a full accounting of the wealthy donors who are gathering contributions for him,"" the Times's Shane Goldmacher and Astead W. Herndon report.

""The remarks represented a departure from Warren’s previous unwillingness to publicly chide most of her top-tier primary opponents, and came as Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in some polls in Iowa, the first state to hold a nominating contest next year. 'I think that Mayor Pete should open up the doors so that anyone can come in and report on what’s being said,' Warren told reporters in Boston. 'Those doors shouldn’t be closed, and no one should be left to wonder what kind of promises are being made to the people that then pony up big bucks to be in the room.'""

Buttigieg's team fires back:

If @ewarren wants to have a debate about transparency, she can start by opening up the doors to the decades of tax returns she’s hiding from her work as a corporate lawyer- often defending the types of corporate bad actors she now denounces. https://t.co/3nGZc7Dzhj — Lis Smith (@Lis_Smith) December 6, 2019

— Buttigieg's time at McKinsey: ""Buttigieg sells his candidacy, in large part, on his mayoralty of South Bend, Ind., and a civic revitalization there rooted in the kind of data-driven techniques espoused by McKinsey. His nearly three years at “the firm” set him apart from many of his campaign rivals, underpinning his position as a more centrist alternative to progressive front-runners like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,"" the Times's Michael Forsythe reports.

""Yet Buttigieg’s time at the world’s most prestigious management-consulting company is one piece of his meticulously programmed biography that he mentions barely, if at all, on the campaign trail. As Buttigieg explains it, that is not a matter of choice. For all of his efforts to run an open, accessible campaign — marked by frequent on-the-record conversations with reporters on his blue-and-yellow barnstorming bus — McKinsey is a famously secretive employer, and Buttigieg says he signed a nondisclosure agreement that keeps him from going into detail about his work there. But as he gains ground in polls, his reticence about McKinsey is being tested, including by his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.""

The NYT's editorial board calls for Buttigieg to release more info on his McKinsey work: ""This is not a tenable situation. Mr. Buttigieg owes voters a more complete account of his time at the company.""

— The ETF that predicts Warren’s 2020 chances: “Those in search of a real-time, market-based way to make money on the possibility that [Warren] wins the Democratic presidential nomination need look no further than one of the market’s biggest health-care funds, according to a Jefferies analysis,” CNBC’s Thomas Franck reports.

“Performance analysis of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF, which tracks the performance of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500, reveals strong negative correlation with Warren’s odds of nomination tracked by political betting site PredictIt.”

— Tarullo: Repo market turmoil raises alarm about post-crisis regs. MarketPlace's Greg Robb: ""Former Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo on Thursday said the turmoil in the crucial short-term lending market in September raises a fundamental question for regulators — will the new rules put in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis exacerbate an 'over-hoarding' of capital during market stress?

""In the September crisis, interest rates on short-term 'repo' loans spiked to 10% from under 2%, setting off alarm bells on Wall Street and in Washington... In a discussion of the repo market stress, sponsored by the Brookings Institution, Tarullo said the episode raises question about an over-arching feature of the new rules — that the biggest banks must amass and hold a large quantity of liquid assets to ensure they can survive periods of stress.""

AD

As the effects from Harris’s departure Tuesday continued to ripple through the Democratic Party, two of the highest-profile candidates of color remaining in the field — Booker (D-N.J.) and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro — sought to seize the moment. They hope to tap into the concerns voiced by many in the party that a lack of diversity among the top candidates could undermine efforts to mobilize voters of color, who stayed home in record numbers in 2016.

AD

Booker, who is African American, and Castro, who is Latino, have both been outspoken in praising Harris (D-Calif.), their erstwhile rival, appealing to her former supporters who are now shopping around for a new candidate to represent their vision of an inclusive party, hoping the Democrats’ self-scrutiny would win their candidacies a second look.

Castro blamed journalists for focusing on which Democrat would be most “electable,” and suggesting a white man would have the best shot at defeating President Trump.

AD

“The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” Castro said on Twitter. “Our party’s diversity is our strength, and it’s a shame that we’re headed for a December debate without a single person of color.”

And on a campaign swing in California, Castro assailed the media for its coverage of Harris, telling CBS News the press had held her to a “a different standard, a double standard … that was grossly unfair” by focusing on turmoil within her campaign rather than her message.

AD

More broadly, Harris’s abrupt exit has spurred Democrats to grapple with the increasing whiteness of their 2020 field, including the possibility the Dec. 19 debate might feature only white candidates.

AD

With the qualification deadline a week away, the remaining minority candidates in the race — Booker, Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and businessman Andrew Yang — have yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling and donor thresholds.

While the Democrats began with a historically diverse field, the candidates who are near the top of most polls — former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — are white.

Booker said it was not rank-and-file Democrats who pushed Harris from the race, adding, “Voters did not determine her destiny.” Rather, he argued, it was a flawed process that favors wealthy candidates, who can use their money to goose their polling numbers and spur additional contributions.

AD

AD

“I’m just going to say it plain: It is a problem that we now have an overall campaign for the 2020 presidency that has more billionaires in it than black people,” Booker said at his Des Moines event.

In the crowd, an older black woman nodded and lifted a hand to the air.

Booker has been especially aggressive on the subject in recent days, speaking about his “anger” over Harris’s exit with reporters and voicing concerns about the debate thresholds with new urgency.

On Tuesday, just hours after Harris’s announcement, Booker’s campaign added Thursday’s speech to a planned four-day, 12-stop swing though Iowa, a state that could determine the fortunes of his struggling presidential bid.

AD

Booker has invested heavily in the ground game in the state and is banking that a good showing here could propel him with new momentum into other early primary states, essentially the same strategy that worked for Barack Obama in 2008. The senator said he was the only candidate in the race who could assemble the same kind of diverse coalition that pushed Obama to victory 11 years ago.

AD

“This election is about something deeper than any candidate,” Booker said. “It’s about how we can inspire the diverse coalitions we need to inspire.”

In Iowa, Harris, like Booker, had built up a robust organization, including an army of newly energized women supporters who are now up for grabs. During his appearance in Des Moines, Booker was careful not to be seen as capitalizing on Harris’s departure, though his message at times was clearly aimed at making inroads with her supporters and other Democrats who are vexed by the party’s diversity problem.

AD

Speaking to reporters backstage after his event, Booker recounted the frustration and conflicting emotions he’d felt since Harris quit the race. He said he’d fielded phone calls from women of color who, citing Harris, questioned if they would ever be able to run for office and win.

AD

“Something about the system is not fair if she couldn’t even make it to Iowa,” Booker said of Harris.

But Harris’s decision to quit the race was also a moment of opportunity for Booker and Castro, who are vying to keep their presidential bids alive.

Ahead of Booker’s speech, his campaign announced that Wednesday was its biggest fundraising day of the race so far, attracting 11,000 new donors. Castro’s campaign said he had raised more than $360,000 from 18,000 donors since Harris’s exit Tuesday.

AD

But candidates must also hit certain polling targets to qualify, and it’s not clear if Booker or Castro will do that. On Thursday, Booker notably called on his supporters to answer their phones when a pollster called — acknowledging concerns within his campaign that voters besieged by robocalls are simply ignoring unknown numbers and failing to register support that could be crucial for his campaign.

AD

“We’re 1 percentage point in almost all these polls from making the debate stage, which, you know, in a very tight sample size, two people, three people,” Booker told reporters. “And if you’re basing the success of my campaign on a 400-person sample size and three people, your metric is the one that we should be talking about, not mine. I’m basing mine on Iowa voters, Iowa caucusgoers and the kind of campaign that we’re building.”

He declined to say what would happen if he failed to qualify for the December debate.

Nancy Bobo, a Des Moines activist and top Booker supporter, said that she and others who have been knocking on doors on the senator’s behalf in recent days had been instructing anyone they encountered to talk to pollsters if they cared about keeping Booker’s voice in the race.

“Answer your phones,” Bobo said. “Please, please answer your phones.”

But in tweets hours later, he drew connections between future U.S. aid and investigations by Ukraine into former vice president Joe Biden — issues that are already at the center of the impeachment inquiry.

AD

Giuliani tweeted that U.S. assistance to Ukraine on anti-corruption reforms could face a “major obstacle” until the “conversation about corruption in Ukraine” is resolved. Giuliani alleged “compelling” evidence of criminal misdeeds by Biden, but gave no specifics.

AD

His presence in Ukraine also advances the efforts of Trump allies to create an alternative narrative in the rapidly moving impeachment investigation — tapping some of Ukraine’s most controversial figures who have spread theories of corruption and impropriety around Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

The New York Times, which first reported Giuliani’s travels, said he had meetings in Budapest and Kyiv this week to meet current and former Ukrainian officials for a documentary.

AD

Derkach noted that their meeting was filmed by “some kind of American television company” but offered no further details.

“Rudolph Giuliani has arrived in Kyiv. We met up immediately to discuss the establishment of the Friends of Ukraine STOP Corruption interparliamentary group,” Derkach said in a Facebook post.

AD

Derkach, an independent lawmaker who was formerly a member of a pro-Russian party in parliament, went to the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow. He is the son of a KGB officer who later served as head of Ukrainian intelligence.

Derkach wrote that Giuliani could help bring experts, journalists and analysts to investigate corruption in Ukraine and “benefit strategic relations between Kyiv and the United States.”

AD

Derkach said he had sent letters Tuesday to key Republicans including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.) and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, seeking their participation.

He said their involvement would help expose the ineffective use of U.S. tax dollars by Ukrainian authorities.

“We sent our proposal. We’re waiting for a reaction, an answer. We’re waiting to see how much this is something that the congressmen and senators are in need of. If they want to work together, we’re ready,” Derkach said.

AD

Derkach said he handed Giuliani documents on allegations relating to inefficient expenditure of U.S. government money on projects in Ukraine and other matters.

AD

The documents do not mention the Bidens. But Derkach makes reference to the energy company Burisma, which had Hunter Biden as a board member.

Right-wing network One America News announced Tuesday it was conducting a “special investigation” with Giuliani, flying three Ukrainian officials to the United States and “debunking Schiff’s impeachment narrative.”

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) chaired the Intelligence Committee that handed down a report concluding that Trump sought to undermine U.S. democracy and endangered national security.

Derkach did not state whether the TV crew with Giuliani was from One America News.

Derkach and another parliamentary deputy, Oleksandr Dubinsky, called a news conference in Kyiv last month announcing plans to launch an investigative committee of the Ukrainian parliament, claiming corruption by top Ukrainian political figures and Burisma.

AD

AD

The company is at the heart of the impeachment investigation, with allegations Trump withheld military aid to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open corruption investigations that could have damaged Joe Biden, a potential rival in next year’s presidential election.

Analysts have dismissed Derkach as spreading disinformation to support the theory, being promoted by Trump allies, that Biden sought the dismissal of a former Ukraine prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, because he wanted to protect his son.

Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said in October that he would carry out an audit to review the handling of all previous cases involving Burisma.

AD

No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has emerged, and European powers were also seeking Shokin’s dismissal, seeing him as corrupt and an obstacle to reform.

AD

Derkach has previously led calls to investigate the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. In 2017, he wrote a letter to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, demanding an investigation into alleged interference in the elections by Ukrainian officials to hamper Trump’s campaign, claiming this had “seriously damaged Ukraine-American relations.”

The July 24, 2017, letter came one day before Trump called on the U.S. attorney general’s office in a tweet to investigate “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage the Trump campaign.”

AD

Derkach and Dubinsky, however, seem to be experiencing difficulty attracting the support of 150 members of parliament — the number required to form the investigative group.

Derkach and Dubinsky have “zero” chance of forming an investigative committee, said one parliamentarian Thursday, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the issue’s sensitivity.

AD

Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and analyst on corruption in Russia and Ukraine, tweeted last month that Derkach and others were spreading “lies” on behalf of Trump and Giuliani.

“Stay away from them! All lies!” he wrote.

He tweeted Wednesday that Giuliani “has chosen Ukrainian interlocutors who are criminals & NEVER say anything true.”

AD

On Tuesday, Giuliani met again with another key figure, former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko, in Budapest, according to the New York Times. Giuliani had met previously with Lutsenko, who also has pushed the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in 2016 elections.

The New York Times reported Giuliani was seeking other meetings with two former prosecutors, Shokin and Kostiantyn Kulyk.

Ukrainian anti-corruption campaigner Daria Kaleniuk, director of the nonprofit Anti-

Corruption Action Center, described Derkach on Twitter as having associations with Ukrainian security services and an allegedly corrupt pharmaceutical firm. She noted that he opposed a system of electronic declaration of parliamentarians’ assets in 2015, designed to clean up endemic Ukrainian corruption.

The Investigations

BRING IT ON: That seems to be the White House's new attitude now that it's all but certain the House will vote to impeach President Trump.

The White House is encouraging Republicans to aggressively defend the president at what's sure to be a rough and tumble impeachment trial in the Senate — and even bring in live witnesses who could counter inevitable accusations Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rivals.

If you can't beat it, join it: ""This isn't going anywhere,"" a source close to the White House working on impeachment told Power Up. ""So [Trump's] leaning fully into it.""

Strategy preview: GOP senators had a private lunch yesterday with White House officials, who briefed senators on the desired parameters for an impeachment trial. ""The president wants his case made fully in the Senate,"" the White House director of legislative affairs, Eric Ueland, said after the lunch, per our colleagues Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian.

The plan for live witnesses is a departure from ""videotaped depositions that were entered into evidence during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999,"" our colleagues write.

Key: “In this instance, we believe very strongly — given the fatally flawed process in the House — that if they were to elect against our better advice [and] send over impeachment to the Senate, that we need witnesses as part of our trial and a full defense of the president on the facts,” Ueland said.

“In this instance, we believe very strongly — given the fatally flawed process in the House — that if they were to elect against our better advice [and] send over impeachment to the Senate, that we need witnesses as part of our trial and a full defense of the president on the facts,” Ueland said. Also briefing senators: White House counsel Pat Cipollone. And two officials who recently joined the White House to steer the response to the inquiry: Pam Bondi, former attorney general of Florida, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman.

Sources familiar with the White House's thinking on impeachment dismissed the current focus in Washington on which Senate Republicans might break with Trump.

""Everyone is focused on defections with Republicans but the more realistic outcome is that there are defections on the Democratic side,"" one source told Power Up, pointing to the most vulnerable Senate Democrats such as Doug Jones (Ala.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va).

Even Democrats are not optimistic about the odds Trump will be convicted: ""There will probably be less votes to impeach Trump in a trial than there was for Bill Clinton,"" a Democratic lawmaker told us.

There's also a political benefit: A public trial with headline-grabbing witnesses puts Trump exactly where he wants to be -- occupying valuable media real estate coveted by the Democrats running for president as they head into the first in the nation's presidential primaries early next year.

Fighting with the media and Democrats ""on the front page of every newspaper for the next few months guaranteed,"" a senior Republican aide on the Hill told us.

Key details are still murky, however: White House officials did not specify which witnesses should be called nor specifics of ""how they would like the trial to be structured,"" our colleagues write. ""Republican senators acknowledged they would not know much about how the trial would unfold until the House drafted articles of impeachment and voted on them.""

Mark your calendars (or not): The Senate floor schedule just released for 2020 doesn’t start until Feb. 1.

The Senate floor schedule just released for 2020 doesn’t start until Feb. 1. “The only thing I know for sure is that nobody knows what we’re doing in January yet,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told them.

EVERYONE GETS A PEP RALLY: Trump could be impeached by the House before Christmas, if the aggressive schedule House Democrats are planning is any indication. Before an 8½ -hour public Judiciary Committee hearing, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) made that clear, even though they haven't announced any firm decision or timeline. From our Post team:

""Are you ready?' Pelosi asked her colleagues, after describing constitutional circumstances posed by Trump’s alleged abuse of power surrounding his Ukraine dealings, as well as his subsequent decision to stonewall the House investigation into the matter.""

after describing constitutional circumstances posed by Trump’s alleged abuse of power surrounding his Ukraine dealings, as well as his subsequent decision to stonewall the House investigation into the matter."" ""The caucus, according to multiple members who attended, erupted with shouts of approval.""

Expect to hear more from Pelosi today:

The Speaker’s Office has just announced the following: Speaker Pelosi will deliver a statement today, Thursday, December 5, at 9:00 a.m. E.T. on the status of the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry. — Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) December 5, 2019

Vice President Mike Pence gave House Republicans their own pep talk, encouraging them to ""turn up the heat"" on Democrats.

""The vice president was clear that he was proud of how the House Republicans have stood together on the impeachment inquiry but wanted to remind us that in our discussions back home, we need to talk about things that are not happening because House Democrats are consumed with impeaching the president,” Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) told our colleagues. He pointed to legislation to curb prescription drug costs and a pending trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.

On The Hill

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT MARATHON HEARING: ""After a more than eight-hour hearing with four constitutional scholars, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said [Trump’s] conduct with Ukraine rose to an impeachable offense,"" our colleagues Colby Itkowitz, Felicia Sonmez and John Wagner report.

From a Democrat's perspective: ""I’m disappointed with our Republican colleagues who spent all day talking about process -- and it’s because they’ve been unwilling to confront the grave misconduct of Trump,"" Judiciary member David Ciccilline (D-R.I.) told Power Up after the hearing.

""They complained about absence of witnesses? Well the single greatest cause of that has been from the president, who has been obstructing Congress,"" he added. ""I think the American people are seeing right through this.""

Back to (law) school: Our colleagues Dan Zak and Ben Terris described the atmosphere in the hearing room. ""And now, here come the academics: Four of them, trailing their curricula vitae like billowing robes, ready to act as counsel for the Founding Fathers, who remain very dead but continue to haunt us. What would the founders think of us? What would they think of [Trump], and the effort to impeach him? To find out, the House Committee on the Judiciary held a sort of seance.""

“Some day we will no longer be alive, and we’ll go wherever it is we go — the good place or the other place,” said one of the Democrats’ witnesses, Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School. “And, you know, we may meet there [James] Madison and [Alexander] Hamilton, and they will ask us: ‘When the president of the United States acted to corrupt the structure of the republic, what did you do?’ ”

The hearing offered a hint at what possible impeachment articles might include: ""Nadler’s opening statement accused Trump of obstructing both the Ukraine probe and the Russia investigation, and it included plenty on the latter, in a way that suggests it was a calculated choice,"" our colleague Aaron Blake reports.

What the GOP is talking about: ""In one of the more heated moments of the day, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) confronted Stanford University law professor Pamela Karlan for invoking Trump’s youngest son Barron when asserting that there are limits to Trump’s power,"" Politico's Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio report.

What happened: Karlan when asked what the difference between a king and a president were quipped, ""While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,” she said before later apologizing.

Karlan when asked what the difference between a king and a president were quipped, ""While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,” she said before later apologizing. The White House seized on the moment: Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed Karlan's joke, and first lady Melania Trump made a rare public and political statement about it, too.

What the Judiciary panel is like: Our colleagues Daniela Santamariña, Kate Rabinowitz and Kevin Uhrmacher illustrated what the committee that will lead this phase of the impeachment inquiry.

In the Agencies

ANOTHER BARR-RELATED SCOOP: ""The prosecutor handpicked by Attorney General William P. Barr to scrutinize how U.S. agencies investigated [Trump’s] 2016 campaign said he could not offer evidence to the Justice Department’s inspector general to support the suspicions of some conservatives that the case was a setup by American intelligence, people familiar with the matter said,"" our colleagues Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report.

More details: ""Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s office contacted U.S. Attorney John Durham, the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, the people said,"" our colleagues write. ""Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign, the people said.""

""Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s office contacted U.S. Attorney John Durham, the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, the people said,"" our colleagues write. ""Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign, the people said."" But there is no evidence the professor was an asset: The professor in question is Joseph Mifsud, who told Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos of possible dirt on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos was later overheard talking about this by an Australian diplomat who tipped off U.S. officials, which started what eventually became the Mueller probe.

This is could rebut conservative doubts ""that Horowitz might be blessing the FBI’s Russia investigation prematurely and that Durham could potentially find more, particularly with regard to the Maltese professor,"" our colleagues write. Barr has expressed these feelings to associates in recent weeks.

It also undermines a potentially GOP counter-theory: Trump allies and even some lawmakers have long questioned the origin story of the Mueller probe and hinted, if not, outright stated that Papadopoulos and others may have been set up. Part of this theory rests on Mifsud, a shadowy figure, being more than just a professor.

A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white.

Democratic contenders who kicked off their campaigns promising to break gender barriers, or rally the rainbow coalition of Barack Obama, instead found themselves fighting concerns that the country’s lingering racism or sexism could help reelect Trump.

AD

“I do think this is a real moment of reckoning in the party,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, a veteran of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign who now works for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, most of whose members are immigrants or women of color. “We had the most diverse field in history, and there is an argument that was soundly rejected by voters.”

AD

To a striking degree, Democratic voters appear to be adopting the role of pundits, choosing candidates based on how they believe other voters will act rather than their own preferences, interviews with voters shows.

Still, the nomination is far from settled. Obama trailed Clinton in the polls in late 2007 before going on to win the nomination, and past nominees such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004 came back from polling deficits the preceding fall. But neither of those candidates was excluded from the party’s debates because of low polling, a prospect that has hit some women and nonwhite candidates particularly hard this year.

AD

Currently, six white candidates, including two women and billionaire financier Tom Steyer, have qualified for the December debate. Two others, businessman Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are of Asian descent, need one more poll at 4 percent to qualify. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who is black, and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, who is Latino, are not likely to make the cut. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black and who entered the race last month, also is not expected to make the stage.

AD

“We have more billionaires onstage than black people,” said former South Carolina state representative Bakari Sellers, who had endorsed Harris. “The Republican top six candidates at this time in 2016 was more diverse than our top six candidates.”

The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black.

AD

Sellers cautioned against buying into fears that Trump would more easily beat a minority candidate. “Trump is an interesting phenomenon: He has actually put the Democratic Party in what I feel is an untenable position by believing we need a white candidate to win,” he said.

Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who had endorsed Harris, said journalists and others were disproportionately critical of the senator’s campaign.

AD

“I think we as a party give lip service to diversity, but we really care very little about it,” Fudge said. “I would say for the highest-ranking elected black woman in the country to have gotten the kind of dismissal by so many people, I think is nothing more than misogynistic, as well as in some respects quite racist.”

AD

Strategists and candidates blame the struggles of female and minority candidates on a variety of factors. The initial fury of the women’s marches that greeted Trump’s arrival in Washington has faded, they say. Individual weaknesses were shown by candidates like Harris, who struggled to articulate a consistent campaign message, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), who ran an unabashed women-focused campaign that failed to connect with voters.

Others point to media coverage that they say focused on white working-class male voters and suggested the party’s overriding challenge was to win them back. Candidates like Harris, Castro and Booker, in contrast, have run explicitly on their promise to turn out more urban voters in the general election.

AD

“There is a narrative that has developed in the media about who can best take on Donald Trump, about this moderate working-class white voter in the Midwest,” Castro said in an interview. “I don’t recall any articles that have spent nearly as much time figuring out what happened with the decline in the black vote, looking at Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia.”

AD

The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.

“You do hear over and over again from women in focus groups, ‘I would like to see a female president, but I think it would be harder for a woman to win,’ ” said one Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private surveys. “People are projecting who people will vote for, who they think will win.”

AD

Some Democratic candidates have directly addressed such fears. Both Castro and Booker have regularly urged Democrats to avoid defaulting to a “safe” choice.

AD

“People have been traumatized by a president who often sounds more like George Wallace than we would hope would sound like George Washington,” Booker said in an interview.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has leaned into her history-making quality as potentially the first female president, has made calls for dreaming big and doing hard things a central part of her message. And at the last Democratic debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) tried to dispel doubts that a woman could take on Trump.

“Women are held to a higher standard — otherwise we could play a game called ‘Name Your Favorite Female President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men,” Klobuchar said. She cited the example of the House speaker. “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,” she said.

Karen Finney, a strategist who worked on Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said the recent gains by women and minorities, including the election of Obama and the nomination of Clinton, do not erase the head winds faced by such candidates.

“There is still cultural bias, frankly,” Finney said. “Some of it is unconscious. There is a sexism and some racism about what a leader looks like and who we think can win.”

In public polls, voters give conflicting signals about their association of race and sex with electability. A June Los Angeles Times/USC survey found that when Democratic voters were asked to describe the characteristics of a nominee with the best chance of beating Trump, 68 percent said that imaginary candidate would be white and 70 percent said the person would be a man.

On the other hand, a September Washington Post-ABC News poll found nearly 8 in 10 saying a candidate’s race did not matter in his or her ability to defeat Trump, while nearly 7 in 10 said the same about gender.

AD

Booker and Castro have argued that rules of the nominating process have contributed to the struggles of nonwhite candidates. Castro points to the enormous influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, two overwhelmingly white states, on selecting the nominee.

Booker blames the rules for qualifying for the Democratic debates, established by party Chair Tom Perez, which emphasize polls and grass-roots fundraising. Such guidelines favor candidates with a narrow appeal, Booker says, and force campaigns to shift focus away from their field programs to raise more money.

Perez allowed 20 candidates to attend the first debates, and he has been gradually winnowing the stage. All the networks hosting debates are required by the party to have nonwhite and female representation among the moderators.

Booker argued that for the January debate, the qualifications should be changed to include endorsements in Iowa and other factors like whether a candidate is considered a second or third choice in the state.

“It is unacceptable that there is a true competition in Iowa that you will not get to see right before their caucus,” Booker said. “That incongruence is unacceptable.” The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3.

Another obstacle for nonwhite candidates has been the staying power of former vice president Joe Biden. He received 27 percent support from Democratic-leaning voters overall in a late October Washington Post-ABC News poll, but 30 percent support among nonwhites and 39 percent support among blacks. Those numbers may shift if he fails to perform well in the early contests in states such as Iowa, where he is polling lower.

Charles Lewis, chairman of the Greenwood County Democratic Party in South Carolina, said many voters in the first Southern state to cast its primary vote feel safer with Biden’s profile.

“I think because he is, of all things, an older white man and this is the South,” said Lewis, who is African American. “People think they rolled the dice on Obama, but now let’s be safe this time and let’s get something done.”"

But Giuliani’s travel also appeared designed to send a broader and more brazen signal of the disregard that he and Trump have for the unfolding impeachment process.

AD

AD

As if to underscore that, Giuliani used his Twitter account while on the trip to describe the impeachment hearings as a “witch hunt,” attack the former U.S. ambassador whom he helped oust earlier this year, and assert that Trump’s demands for politically beneficial investigations by Ukraine’s government were appropriate.

The flurry of messages seemed designed to taunt Democrats in Washington.

Current and former officials in Washington expressed astonishment at how Giuliani — apparently on behalf of the president — seemed to be mocking impeachment investigators, if not the very idea that either he or his client should answer any articles of impeachment.

AD

“It’s unbelievable to me the open way in which the administration and Giuliani are still pursuing this,” said Jeffrey Edmonds, who served as Russia director at the White House National Security Council under both Barack Obama and Trump. “It is a way of . . . asserting that everything that we’re doing is perfectly normal, perfectly fine and we’re going to keep doing it.”

AD

Giuliani couldn’t be reached for comment on his trip.

The aftermath of Giuliani’s trip came as the White House signaled that it would not mount a formal defense of Trump in the House impeachment proceedings. White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone sent a letter to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday, saying adopting articles of impeachment “would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats.”

AD

Giuliani’s trip also represented an affront to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose government was welcoming a high-level State Department diplomat at the same time and hoping to return relations with the United States to normal after more than two months at the center of an American political maelstrom.

Zelensky, who didn’t meet with Giuliani, is preparing for a high-stakes summit on Monday in Paris, where he is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladi­mir Putin alongside the leaders of Germany and France in a renewed attempt to bring an end to the war between Russia-backed proxies and Ukrainian forces in the nation’s east. More than 13,000 people have died in the conflict.

AD

The disruption in U.S.-Ukraine relations caused by Giuliani’s activities and the resulting impeachment inquiry have led some Ukrainians to fear that Zelensky, who promised an end to the conflict during his campaign, will cut a bad deal with Putin, owing partly to a growing sentiment in Kyiv that Ukraine can no longer count on support from the United States.

AD

Such concerns appeared to be far from Giuliani’s mind.

During his trip, he sat down with a mustachioed Ukrainian lawmaker who has promoted Russian interests in Ukraine and once studied at a KGB academy in Moscow.

He was accompanied by a former Ukrainian diplomat who has won renown in U.S. right-wing circles by alleging Ukraine colluded with the DNC to undermine Trump in 2016.

He received a bon voyage message from a former Ukrainian parliamentarian, who once sent a peace proposal to the White House that would have lifted sanctions on Russia and recognized the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea.

AD

The trip also served a practical purpose ahead of a likely Senate trial of his client. Giuliani brought a correspondent from the right-wing One America News to interview many of the Ukrainians he has interacted with in the past year — people who are willing to make allegations against Biden and the Democrats.

AD

The footage will help inject the theories Giuliani has gathered over the past year even further into the American public discourse, as the Senate prepares to embark on a trial that some Republican lawmakers want to make as much about Biden as it is about the president.

Giuliani has alleged that Biden pushed for the 2016 firing of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to help his son, Hunter Biden, who at the time was a board member of a Ukrainian gas company whose owner was under investigation in Ukraine. Apart from a claim by the top prosecutor in question that Biden had him fired for that reason, no evidence has surfaced to show that is why Biden sought his removal. European Union leaders also wanted the prosecutor removed.

AD

During the trip, Giuliani said on Twitter that until the matter is resolved, the issue “will be a major obstacle to the U.S. assisting Ukraine with its anti-corruption efforts.”

AD

In Kyiv, Giuliani met with two members of Ukraine’s parliament, Andriy Derkach and Oleksandr Dubinsky, who have called for a joint U.S.-Ukrainian parliamentary investigation into the gas company. The One America News correspondent traveling with Giuliani posted photos of them interviewing former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko in Budapest, where they stopped before traveling on to Ukraine.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats were shocked by Giuliani’s nerve.

“It’s a brazen move,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, which led the impeachment inquiry. “This is emblematic of this White House: When they are in the wrong, they double down. And in this case, they are tripling down.”

AD

AD

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the trip an indication of “the arrogance of it all” in comments at a CNN Town Hall on Thursday night.

Some Republicans were left scratching their heads.

Asked about the trip, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) replied, “Rudy does what Rudy does.”

Others were surprised. “The fact that Giuliani is back in Ukraine is like a murder suspect returning to the crime scene to live-stream themselves moon dancing,” said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor and Trump supporter. “It’s brazen on a galactic level.”

At the White House, deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley sidestepped the matter.

“That’s a question between Rudy and the president,” Gidley said.

AD

Privately, however, two officials involved in the White House’s impeachment response said Trump aides were not told Giuliani was traveling to Ukraine and do not view it as helpful.

AD

Some House Republicans have sought to create distance between Trump and Giuliani, but the president has not yet signaled a willingness to support such a move, the two officials said. On Friday, Gidley said that as a far as he was aware, Giuliani remained Trump’s personal attorney.

Monday’s summit in Paris, where he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time, has generated hopes for them to reach a lasting cease-fire.

In a recent video that he recorded in a gym, Zelenskiy argued that trying to end the bloodshed without speaking directly to Russia was similar to working out on a treadmill.

AD

AD

“Some say we can do without such dialogue,” he said. “But it’s like running this treadmill — you are doing something, you are losing calories, but you remain in place.”

The summit comes as a crucial test for Zelenskiy, who also has become embroiled in an impeachment inquiry by the U.S. Congress of President Donald Trump.

In a July 25 phone call, Trump pressed the Ukrainian to investigate political rival Joe Biden, while the White House was withholding about $400 million in essential military aid to Kyiv. The suspension fueled fears among Ukrainians that Washington was turning its back on them or forcing them into a weakened position with Russia.

AD

Zelenskiy has been seeking a meeting with leaders of Russia, France and Germany for months. The first such session was held in Normandy, France, in 2014, shortly after Moscow threw its support behind the separatists in the Donbass industrial region in eastern Ukraine. The conflict erupted weeks after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula following the ouster of the country’s Russia-leaning president earlier that year.

AD

The U.S. and the European Union responded with an array of sanctions against Russia, making the prospect of lifting them contingent on a peace deal that was brokered by France and Germany. The 2015 agreement, which was signed in the Belarusian capital of Minsk after a series of battlefield defeats suffered by Ukrainian troops, envisaged a wide autonomy for the separatist regions in a diplomatic coup for Russia.

The Minsk accord met the Kremlin’s goal of securing self-rule for the rebel regions that would allow Moscow to control its neighbor and dampen Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO.

AD

“Minsk actually more or less gives Russia what Russia wanted to have,” said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

The document, which was negotiated by Zelenskiy’s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, outraged many in Ukraine. Its provisions for autonomy of the rebel-held territory and a sweeping amnesty for the separatists were never implemented. Sporadic fighting has continued in the east despite the peace deal, blocking attempts at a political settlement.

AD

Now Putin intends to use the Paris summit to raise the pressure on Zelenskiy to fulfill the Minsk deal, counting on support from French President Emmanuel Macron, who has signaled a desire to normalize ties with Russia. If the 2015 agreement is implemented, it could pave way for a relief from the EU sanctions while allowing Moscow to keep leverage over Ukraine.

AD

Putin and his lieutenants have warned that Moscow won’t accept any changes in the Minsk document, particularly on the most sensitive issue of border controls. Under the 2015 agreement, Ukraine could only regain control of the frontier with Russia in the rebel-held territories after those regions hold local elections and receive autonomous status. Pro-Moscow sentiment runs high in those areas, especially the provincial capitals of Donetsk and Luhansk.

“Russia wants the Minsk implemented the way it was formulated and with the logic of the border coming last,” Trenin said. “Putin isn’t going anywhere to lose.”

AD

He noted that even though Putin realizes that it’s hard for Zelenskiy to implement the Minsk deal for domestic reasons, the Russian leader “wants to show the Europeans his good faith, his commitment to Minsk, his preparedness to walk his part of the way to reach an agreement.”

AD

Zelenskiy said the Minsk deal was bad for Ukraine and vowed to try to revise it, saying he will push for quickly regaining control of the border and demanding the withdrawal of Russian soldiers from the rebel-held territories. The Kremlin has denied that any Russian troops are in Ukraine.

Vyacheslav Nikonov, the head of education committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, argued that the Minsk agreement is “the only thing that keeps Donbass inside Ukraine.” He warned that if Ukraine rejects the Minsk deal, as some in Kyiv had suggested, “that means Donbass will become free.”

AD

“For Zelenskiy, the only chance to achieve some progress is to keep up with the Minsk accords,” Nikonov said.

AD

Many in Ukraine fear that Putin, who has been in power for nearly 20 years, could easily outmaneuver the Ukrainian rookie politician.

“Zelenskiy risks being left alone against the three others, with the leaders of France and Germany playing on the Russian side,” said Vadim Karasev, head of the Kyiv-based Center for Global Strategies. “The Minsk agreements left Kyiv little choice — to re-integrate Donetsk and Luhansk on Russian conditions and get a ‘Trojan horse,’ or lose those territories in a frozen conflict.”

Karasev noted that Zelenskiy will try to avoid any radical moves, fearing a backlash from Ukrainian right-wingers and radical nationalists who strongly oppose any rapprochement with Russia. He said the Paris talks could yield some incremental results — such a deal to exchange prisoners or troops pulling back from the front line — but no breakthrough.

AD

AD

Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta think-tank, predicted Zelenskiy will come under strong pressure from those who oppose any deal with Russia irrespective of the outcome of the talks.

“Even if Zelenskiy doesn’t sign anything, he will face suspicions and accusations,” Fesenko said. “And if he reaches agreements on troops’ pullback, they will accuse him of capitulation.”

The political party of Poroshenko, the former president, and other opposition groups scheduled a rally in Kyiv for Sunday to warn Zelenskiy against making any concessions.

Opinion surveys indicate broad public support for his peace efforts.

A nationwide poll last month showed 75 percent of respondents backing them. The poll of 2,041 people, conducted by the Democratic Initiatives foundation and the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points.

Trump is not identified by name in the House phone records, but investigators said they suspect he may be a person with a blocked number listed as “-1” in the files. And administration officials said separately that Trump has communicated regularly with Giuliani on unsecured lines.

“It happened all the time,” said one former senior aide, who noted that Giuliani had a range of foreign clients.

The disclosures provide fresh evidence suggesting that the president continues to defy the security guidance urged by his aides and followed by previous incumbents — a stance that is particularly remarkable given Trump’s attacks on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign for her use of a private email account while serving as secretary of state.

AD

The connection to the Ukraine campaign is also troubling because of how Moscow could exploit knowledge that Trump was secretly engaged in efforts to extract political favors from the government in Kyiv.

AD

Insight into Giuliani’s discussions with Trump could enable Moscow to adapt or amplify its propaganda promoting the baseless claim that Ukraine, rather than Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee in the 2016 U.S. election. That claim is now widely embraced by Trump’s Republican allies. Russia is already using its disinformation capabilities to target U.S. citizens, officials said, and could enlist its own operatives in Ukraine to feed false information to Giuliani, who traveled to Kyiv this week. He met there with a Ukrainian lawmaker who studied at the KGB’s academy in Moscow in the early 1990s.

The White House declined to comment, and Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment.

AD

Trump and Giuliani have effectively “given the Russians ammunition they can use in an overt fashion, a covert fashion or in the twisting of information,” said John Sipher, former deputy chief of Russia operations at the CIA. Sipher and others said that it is so likely that Russia tracked the calls of Giuliani and others that the Kremlin probably knows more now about those conversations than impeachment investigators.

AD

“Congress and investigators have call records that suggest certain things but have no means whatsoever of getting the actual text” of what was said, Sipher said. “I guarantee the Russians have the actual information.”

U.S. officials said that Giuliani would have been considered a target of Russian intelligence efforts from early in Trump’s presidency and that it is assumed that the Kremlin intensified its surveillance of the president’s lawyer when he turned his focus to Ukraine — a former Soviet republic and target of Kremlin aggression where Russian intelligence has made deep inroads — late last year.

AD

“That would definitely put him on the radar,” said a U.S. official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “There’s no way around that.”

Other officials went further, saying that Trump’s conduct has become a matter of renewed concern among senior officials at the White House after repeated attempts to break him of his habit of speaking on his own cellphone or to others using unsecured lines.

AD

“It’s absolutely a security issue,’’ the former aide said, noting that foreign intelligence agencies could be listening in on the president’s unsecured calls with Giuliani. “It’s a bonanza for them.”

Former officials said Trump has provided his private cell number to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but it’s unclear whether he has had conversations with those leaders on his cellphone. Four people in communication with him in recent months said that he continues to use that device routinely.

AD

John F. Kelly, then White House chief of staff, and intelligence officials made a concerted attempt in 2017 to get Trump to use secure White House lines, even after the president had retreated to the residence in the evenings, officials said. But when Trump realized that this enabled Kelly to compile daily logs of his calls, and the identities of those he was speaking to, Trump became annoyed and reverted to using his cellphone, officials said. “He was totally paranoid that everyone knew who he was talking to,” a former senior administration official said.

AD

Aides were so determined to push the president to use hardened landlines that they gave him a tutorial on how foreign governments could listen to his calls, former administration officials said. Aides said that Trump’s habits improved but that he still frequently used a cellphone they viewed as less safe.

The president now uses a government cellphone that is hardened and routinely scrubbed, administration officials say, but it is still viewed as less safe than using the hardened lines.

AD

The House report identifies dozens of calls at key moments in the campaign to pressure Ukraine that may have been vulnerable to Russian monitoring.

On the day that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was told by the State Department to return to Washington, Giuliani had 11 calls with phone numbers associated with the White House, according to the report, as well as a nearly nine-minute phone call with “-1.”

In the middle of that flurry of communications, Giuliani had an eight-minute phone call with Lev Parnas, his Soviet-born associate, raising the possibility that the former New York mayor may have been recounting his interactions with the White House that day. Foreign intelligence agencies often glean information about a primary target, such as a senior official in the White House, through monitoring the ancillary communications of others in touch with them, according to former intelligence operatives.

The web of calls underscores the extent to which Trump entrusted aspects of his secret agenda with Ukraine to a network of people outside the U.S. government.

Senior administration officials, including former top White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill, testified that they were largely kept in the dark about Giuliani’s activities and communications with Trump.

U.S. officials said that Russia has benefited from nearly every aspect of the Ukraine controversy, including the strain it has placed on Ukraine’s relationship with the United States, the attempt to divert attention from Russia’s attacks on a U.S. election, and the paralyzing impact the impeachment inquiry has had on Washington.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced on Wednesday that the House would proceed with articles of impeachment against Trump, who is accused of abusing the powers of his office for political gain. At the center of the case is a July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, and probe a conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine rather than Russia for hacking the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election.

As alleged leverage, Trump withheld a White House meeting sought by Zelensky until the Ukrainian leader made a public commitment to those investigations, which stood to help Trump in the 2020 election, and ordered a suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The records released in the House impeachment report show potential security vulnerabilities that extend beyond the White House. The report also lists calls between Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and Parnas, who officials said is also considered a likely target of Russian intelligence, given that he was going back and forth to Ukraine and speaking to high-level tycoons and government officials there.

In an appearance on Fox News this week, Nunes said that he did not recall speaking with Parnas but that it was possible. A spokesman for Nunes did not respond to requests for comment on his communications with Parnas and Giuliani.

U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland also spoke in July with Trump by cellphone from an outdoor table at a restaurant in central Kyiv, a city where U.S. officials said Russia had intercepted a phone call in 2014 between two senior U.S. diplomats and leaked it to drive a wedge between the United States and Europe.

House investigators’ ability to obtain Giuliani’s call records by subpoenaing logs from mobile phone companies suggests that those calls were not made using secure lines or encrypted applications such as Signal or WhatsApp — which likely would have rendered those calls invisible to the mobile providers.

The metadata logs provide details on the time, duration and participants on the calls but not their contents. Citing that gap, Giuliani suggested this week that he may not have been speaking to Trump about Ukraine during the conversations.

“The mere fact I had numerous calls with the White House does not establish any specific topic,” Giuliani said in a tweet on Wednesday. “Remember, I’m the president’s attorney.”

But Giuliani has previously said he was updating the president regularly on his Ukraine activities, and Trump told those working on Ukraine policy to go through Giuliani.

Even the use of a secure White House line provides no meaningful security if the recipient of the call is on an unsecured line or cellphone, officials said.

“Giuliani calling the president through the Situation Room does not guarantee any level of security because he’s using a commercial cellphone and at least part of his call is coming over commercial phone lines,” said Larry Pfeiffer, former senior director of the White House Situation Room in the Obama administration and former chief of staff to the CIA director. And even if both parties were using commercially encrypted apps such as WhatsApp or Signal, Pfeiffer said, “I would not want to be trusting commercial encryption over government encryption when conducting national security business.”

Giuliani has used the ­WhatsApp encrypted text application but is otherwise known for his lack of technological sophistication."
